Title: Rich Tabor: UX Design and Gutenberg Blocks
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	As we take our first steps into a block-based editing system within WordPress 5.0 and beyond, designing exceptional WordPress experiences has never been more important.
Let’s take a look at how to level-up our design capabilities and explore strategies to building block experiences within Gutenberg that can be notably complex, yet extraordinarily simple at the same time.
In a world where the lines between design and development are blurred more than ever, we’ll dive into design patterns, user experience, and even a couple programming techniques and ideas — all to understand how to design remarkable user experiences in Gutenberg blocks.

everyone I'm rich Tabor and I recently

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,010
joined GoDaddy as the senior product

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,320
manager of WordPress experience my role

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,750
at GoDaddy is to empower folks to build

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,520
beautiful WordPress websites in the

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,830
entirety of the user experience that

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
surrounds there right now we're focusing

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,949
a little bit more on the Gutenberg side

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,930
of things and that's kind of where my

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,760
last year of development has taken me so

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,199
I thought it'd be a good idea to dive

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,390
into the things I've learned along the

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,930
way so that we can collectively build

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,390
better WordPress experiences because

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,940
realistically if we're building these

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,760
awesome great experiences and WordPress

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,070
is easier to use and more delightful to

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,570
use we're all gonna win because then

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,520
WordPress is going to get more and more

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,520
popular and easier and easier to use so

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,059
if you'd like to follow along on your

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,370
phones or tablets or anything you can go

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,440
to xqo slash tabor and on the sides

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,260
we'll pull up there and they'll switch

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,600
when I switch as well can also catch me

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,060
on Twitter at Richard underscore Tabor

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,520
and afterwards I'll be right across the

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:16,470
hall at the happiness bar for additional

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:19,890
questions or chats of any sort yeah I'll

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,360
get them up there yeah all right so

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,960
let's get started at looking at user

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,520
experience from a very wide angled lens

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,530
right designing exceptional WordPress

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,150
experiences has never been more

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,340
important than it is today because

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,049
Guttenberg changes the very foundation

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,030
of how we manipulate content and

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,770
WordPress it's known for its right now

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,079
WordPress itself is known for its in

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,570
direct manipulation interface that's

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,979
where settings and options are buried

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,680
and within different locations

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,899
throughout WordPress you'll notice a few

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,630
of these we've got admin pages widgets

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,369
short codes customizer settings and

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,930
controls and within the customizer

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,649
there's various panels and various

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,909
sections of controls in there by itself

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,350
then we have third-party applications

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,149
where you're signing out of your

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,590
WordPress site into something else

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,720
configuring something then coming back

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,900
into your WordPress just to add a

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,640
empty widget or empty plug into a page

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,680
all of these collectively are making the

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,200
WordPress experience kind of mediocre

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,190
and kind of difficult especially for

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,950
anyone who's new to WordPress Guttenberg

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,470
on the other hand introduces a landmark

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,750
shift in user experience for WordPress

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,910
we're basically starting fresh with the

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,690
editor and we really have a chance to

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,270
make some vast improvements in this for

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,580
one the new editor is using a new direct

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,090
manipulation interface with blocks at

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,980
the helm and in the context of Gutenberg

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,510
direct manipulation is an interaction

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,330
style where we're editing and

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,320
manipulating each atomic block and in

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,540
the context of itself

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,660
what makes Gutenberg so awesome is that

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,160
its inherent flexibility the different

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,470
core design patterns that we can

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,570
leverage and the core components that

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,160
are built into Gutenberg that when we're

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,170
building our own Gutenberg experiences

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,709
we can leverage to build amazing

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,170
experiences now this makes the editor

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,570
quite a bit more powerful like we all

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,070
can agree but at the same time and as a

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,750
consequence it makes it a little bit

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:30,110
more complex than the classic editor but

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,769
in all reality complexity is not bad

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:37,830
it's difficult and challenging but it's

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,890
not bad you know it invokes that

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,530
difficulty and is challenging and

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,440
engaging and that's the kind of the mark

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,350
we want to hit blocks of any nature

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,430
should strive to be absolutely reducing

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,980
the cognitive load of using editor

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,670
things should be as simple as seamless

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,769
and as cohesive as possible because we

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,519
want to design and build blocks that are

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,299
inevitably complex by nature but are not

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,299
complicated

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,540
so how do we do that we start with the

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,030
Gutenberg design patterns that are set

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,609
already in place for us these patterns

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,690
are combination of solutions bundled in

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,729
a reusable manner for common behavioral

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,820
structural and creational software

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:32,540
patterns in an application why is this

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,610
important we must grasp these principles

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,290
of these Gutenberg design patterns in

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:42,290
their entirety to build remarkable

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,900
experiences not blocks we're trying to

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,580
engage the user at a very personal level

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,590
when they're editing their content and

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,940
build the experience around the block

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,940
that they're creating and that they're

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,070
using not the actual block because what

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,500
matters is how they perceive WordPress

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:01,370
in that atomic context of using that

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,050
custom block so in essence were hardly

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,780
building blocks were really building

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,490
experiences little micro experiences

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:14,840
within each block so let's dive into the

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:19,310
actual block level interface and take a

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,440
deeper look into Gutenberg as a whole so

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,710
at the atomic level a block itself is

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,729
the most basic unit of the editor

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,130
everything we are going to interact with

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,320
with an editor is a block paragraphs are

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,560
now blocks headings are blocks images

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,389
quotes pricing tables every single thing

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,770
you add within the white space white

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:42,080
space of that page is now a block with

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,419
its direct manipulation interface that

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,070
blocks settings and controls are now

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,169
controlled within that one atomic

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,090
interface so when you select a block

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,300
they're going to surface those blocks

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,539
controls and settings now what this does

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,000
is allows for a wide variety of advanced

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,370
features and advanced controls while

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,789
also not overpowering the interface and

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,990
creating a very complicated and complex

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,940
solution we want to make sure that

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,330
things are not complicated even though

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,610
they are complex so there are three main

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,610
areas where we can add our controls and

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:20,930
our settings within our blocks

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:25,750
is the block toolbar the block settings

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:28,039
sidebar and then the block content area

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:32,050
we're gonna dive into each one of these

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,759
and starting with the block content area

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,009
now interaction within the block content

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,020
area is the most intuitive to use and

00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:41,930
should be thought of as the number one

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,060
primary interface for adding and

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,009
manipulating content this is when you're

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,810
first looking at a block a like for

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,610
example in the paragraph block all you

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,259
do is type that's did the rest right

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,150
there as direct its in-your-face and

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,979
that's exactly what you all you need to

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,800
do if you want to do extra stuff there

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,389
are other controls elsewhere now there

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,969
are two main patterns for interacting

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,310
within a blocks Content area that's

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:09,349
using placeholders and contextual

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,870
controls the first type of pattern is

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:14,240
the placeholder now the placeholder is

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,219
content within the content area of the

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,500
block that can be thought of as a guide

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:21,050
or a placeholder or a set of

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,050
instructions in the interface for the

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,719
user to follow now the requirements here

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,029
is that it must be thoughtful it must be

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,650
entirely relative to the situation that

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,509
we're in when we're experiencing this

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,509
block and it must be short and concise

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,250
let's look at some examples here this is

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,520
a masonry gallery block I built into

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,800
block gallery now this gallery block has

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,310
a placeholder component with directions

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,830
on how to upload or select media in this

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,599
gallery once you add that media the

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,669
placeholder is in replaced with the

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,669
rendered gallery closely resembling what

00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,990
we're going to see on the front end this

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,849
is just one way of how to use

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,479
placeholders placeholders can take quite

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,789
a few different forms for example this

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,639
pricing table block here has Micro

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,979
placeholders for the plan for the dollar

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,469
sign for the amount and each of the

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,870
features and even the buttons using

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:20,389
these instructions we're creating a

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,669
pathway for users to create their and

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,589
fill out their pricing tables that way

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,839
you're not going in and manipulating

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,770
stuff taking forever just to try to get

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,770
somewhere yes

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,890
so when when I first right here when I

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,170
first add those images before you see

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,180
the gallery all it says is masonry

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,460
gallery it might be too hard to read and

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,680
it says drag or drag images or upload

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,600
into this placeholder so all I'm doing

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,600
is dragging those images right into it

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,200
[Music]

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,010
to just right it's just a placeholder

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:16,810
there so each what we're doing then we

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,880
type something into these custom blocks

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,730
is this saving it as an attribute of

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,410
that block so that renders it basically

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,740
that's the data structure for each of

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,740
these blocks

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:44,260
this is a blog that I've created that's

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:45,399
in there for videos yeah right now it's

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,329
on the Kobach's plugin

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,250
it's within there hey but yeah I'm just

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:59,640
sure these are just more advanced ways

00:09:51,250 --> 00:10:02,579
to do things yeah the plugin plugin yeah

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,940
correct yes

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:08,410
yeah I'm just showing how we can use

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,300
yeah I'm just showcasing how we can use

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:18,329
various placeholders in one to

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,329
particular block here yes it does

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,020
right it should yeah you just installed

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:32,670
a plug-in and it should be working

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:35,640
mm-hmm the co box plug-in not this

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,960
particular pricing table now yeah you

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,670
know and we'll go through the pricing

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,430
table and a couple other block case

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,780
studies at the end here in a live demo

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:50,250
yeah all right

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,930
got it and here's another example now

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,080
this place holders all it's asking for

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,520
is a gist URL once you add your gist URL

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,640
in there it's going to start rendering

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,530
the actual gist so you can see the

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,750
pattern here is the placeholders

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,880
requesting information and in this case

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,190
we're requesting that URL as soon as you

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,540
add that URL and press ENTER it's going

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,760
to actually render what it's supposed to

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,680
render that's kind of the the pattern

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,740
here that we're kind of reiterating on

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:22,470
over and over so aside from patterns we

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,990
have contextual controls it's a

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,130
alternative pattern choice and one of

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,810
the two common as aside from

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,360
placeholders and these are logical

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,210
controls that are based on variables

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,360
within this one singular block now these

00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,540
must be minimal and not disorienting and

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,730
I'll show you guys what I mean here

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,650
so as you select on this gallery block

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,150
we're going to see this new uploaded

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,150
image button show up

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,600
now these controls are rendered based on

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,450
the fact that we have media already and

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,640
we need a way to add more or upload more

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,230
otherwise we'd have to figure you have

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,550
to somehow like do something because

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,800
we're going to want to edit our media

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,500
and improve our gallery or switch it up

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,000
with more stuff in the important thing

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,220
I'm doing here is this a very minimal

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,440
change I'm not really disorienting the

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,270
UI I'm not switching things up to make

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,250
it seem much more complicated than it

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:21,450
actually is and the core gallery block

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,450
does the same exact thing yeah

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,520
in this particular gallery it just

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,980
basically is a percentage base so your

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,660
images will fit masonry wise when

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,660
whatever percentage basis selected at

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,190
it'll change how tall they are

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,090
technically like a very wide image would

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,090
show super-short

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,330
all right

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,480
a little bit yeah so outside of the

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,520
block content area we have those other

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,560
two methods the toolbar in the settings

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,680
sidebar let's take a look at the toolbar

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,990
here now the toolbar is very interesting

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,870
because the this houses controls that

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,340
are 100% necessary for manipulating your

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,050
block these must be contextual as well

00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,420
fitting within the current UI you can't

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,370
add anything that's going to break the

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,730
current UI model within the toolbar and

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,260
they need to be again 100% necessary for

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,040
managing that block and that's really

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,800
important so here's a map block this is

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,540
also a block I added within KO box at

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,510
the very top right there I'm toggling an

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,120
edit location toolbar control now this

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,400
control is contextual it only appears if

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,950
we have an address or a location saved

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,690
within the map block otherwise we don't

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,750
need to edit a location if there's not

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,430
one there clicking on that control we

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,200
will reveal the original placeholder UI

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,240
it'll flip us back if you can just

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,650
imagine us kind of flip in it and where

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,300
we can edit it and once we hit apply

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,120
that flips it back and we see our map

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,610
once again this operation is necessary

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,890
for managing that block because we want

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,120
to be able to change our location

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:18,950
therefore is properly placed within the

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,950
block tool bar up top so then we have

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,290
our sidebar settings now while the block

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,910
tool bar houses these controls that are

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,280
absolutely necessary for your block

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,050
these sidebar settings is where you put

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,680
all of the advanced functionality that

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,690
is not necessary for your block these

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,160
also must be contextual it's kind of a

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,170
theme that we're going on everything we

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,540
do in our blocks needs to have some sort

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,290
of relative functionality based on

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,290
something else

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,700
so here's that Matlock the same exact

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,010
one now we're looking at the settings

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,090
sidebar on the right here I have zoom

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,430
level and an height in pixels level and

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,430
as you add an address the zoom level and

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,470
now the height in pixels options are now

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,600
available to manipulate in this setting

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,970
sidebar neither of those are absolutely

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,400
necessary for this block which is why

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,990
they're placed within the sidebar and if

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,030
you look closely at the map block at the

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,670
very bottom there's this little blue nib

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,190
when you select on the block that little

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,930
blue nib shows that this block is also

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,210
resizable you can click on that it's a

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,010
design pattern within all the Guttenberg

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,780
core blocks when you click on that you

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,660
can drag it what I'm doing there is

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,370
using that block content area as the

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,200
primary interface of this block and

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,150
putting controls in there that we can

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,830
leverage so you don't have to go to the

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,600
settings sidebar now all of these UI

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,940
pieces that have shown you including

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,130
that resizable box with a little handle

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,320
at the bottom here the zoom level and

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,480
the height and pixels and even the icons

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,710
within the tool bar up top all of these

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,070
are core components provided by

00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:00,080
WordPress now these core components are

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,560
provided so that we can have a level of

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,820
consistency across all of our blocks

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,530
including and especially including

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,740
third-party blocks because a consistent

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,760
experience is absolutely paramount

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,500
otherwise we're gonna have this

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,600
fragmented some blocks where it grapes

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,340
some blocks or terrible kind of system

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,140
where we almost have now when editing

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,820
content within the classic editor and

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,940
all these other different types of page

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,940
builders and then you end up doing this

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,550
so these blocks must be 100% familiar

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,980
and you know it if you can make it feel

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,900
as if it's a core block where you don't

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,490
have to relearn anything new when you're

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,080
manipulating this brand-new block that

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,370
you've never seen before then that's

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,370
when you're hidden right on the target

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,110
let's take a look at some more core

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,220
components within Guttenberg right now

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,100
we're just gonna look at the paragraph

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,310
block within the paragraph block we have

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,589
the font size drop cap and color

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,100
settings options within the settings

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:06,439
sidebar here the font size component is

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,839
called the font size picker and this is

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,959
built into core where you can also

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:14,870
customize the actual number if you want

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,970
to do like an advanced type sizing and

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,159
you can reset it back to the default or

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,039
pick one of the themes specified small

00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:23,900
normal large are huge you can also use

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,669
the toggle component built into core to

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,459
add a drop cap option or whatever you're

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:30,559
doing and what's neat about that is we

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,570
have the help tag help text underneath

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,000
the drop cap which right now says toggle

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,500
to show a large initial letter as we

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,020
toggle that we can switch it to be

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,600
contextual whether it will say show in a

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,110
large letter or initial letter so that

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,700
way we can actually do really contextual

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:53,570
help guides to help people understand

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:55,970
what's happening yes yeah I don't know

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,210
if we can right now besides maybe tab or

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:03,850
a pair or spaces yeah maybe spaces in

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,850
right now yeah

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,269
yeah well using these components we

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,850
could extend the paragraph block and add

00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:17,100
a tab or had a toggle to indent this

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,179
paragraph we could do that relatively

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,679
easy and it would look just like the

00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,539
drop cap toggle right underneath it

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,630
that's something like we could think

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,909
about doing then we have the color

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,320
settings panel at the bottom or it's

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,419
called panel color settings is the

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,240
official term for this panel down here

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,279
and this will pull in any of the theme

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,769
colors that the theme has specified for

00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,879
the color palette and it's pretty it's

00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,580
pretty interesting because we can

00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:44,639
basically tie into the system and apply

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,440
colors from whatever whatever we want to

00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:48,240
do within our blocks as long as we're

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,590
following this same exact pattern by

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,509
having it within the color settings

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,370
panel and then having it trigger the

00:18:51,509 --> 00:19:01,169
colors on the left then we're good all

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,299
right so now let's do some demo time do

00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,600
have any other questions while I pulled

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,600
the demo

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:20,500
ha yeah so on the core github repository

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,870
on WordPress or on a wordpress is github

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,820
repository there's a like you could find

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,700
all of the entirety of the components

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,280
there and there are a crazy number like

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,870
maybe 50 to 100 and even more so after

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,550
that like they're always continuously

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:47,560
adding more and more of these components

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:48,910
that we can reuse ok as in users here

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,150
I'll show you let me pull up the demo

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,150
here

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,880
it's an attempt to make building pages

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,880
better in core WordPress page bill

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,700
yeah I mean I think that there will be a

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,500
need for a little while maybe a little

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,630
bit longer because they're serving

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,090
almost a different market they're going

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,460
for the building these really crazy

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,400
websites and and beautiful pages and

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,590
stuff but it is much more complex than

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,880
then it should be for everyday people

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,340
just trying to make a really awesome

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,990
website on their own and I think so this

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,390
is trying to push that where we're just

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,640
trying to empower people to build these

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,470
websites using as simple as tools as

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
possible by following all of these

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,440
patterns and all these core components

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
that they're laid out for us

00:20:52,350 --> 00:21:04,690
and Genesis I think you can yes alright

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:08,500
so there we add to you okay now this is

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:11,200
a little tight it looks like but we're

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,780
going to showcase a little bit of stuff

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,870
here let's go into first we're going to

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,740
do with the shape divider Spock is

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:22,690
pretty neat this right here is the the

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,460
block content area and remember this is

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,860
the primary area for when we're editing

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,260
and manipulating our content which is

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,630
why I built this resizable bar right

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,050
here where we can resize the height of

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,230
this divider and also the space between

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,490
the content and the divider itself the

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,290
idea would be you could add another

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,850
container down here that would have the

00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,010
same background color and make this like

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:50,080
really cool wave effect within your

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:52,000
media now this right here is a color

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,100
picker and this is also a component

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,520
built into Guttenberg that I leveraged

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,660
and in the spirit of bringing the stuff

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,580
out of the sidebar and out of the

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,560
toolbars and into the primary interface

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,230
I added it right here so we can just

00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,400
manipulate this color so let's do some

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,400
something cool

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,990
this is something that I built to

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,070
demonstrate the different components and

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:25,160
how we can leverage them yes yes you

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:32,030
could use this you could use this yeah

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:33,320
yeah yes and and you know if you know if

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,820
we're designing and building our own

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,130
blocks we could leverage these same

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:41,169
components in the same style to try to

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:43,130
to create uniform experiences all around

00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:46,429
what's neat about this block in

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:51,520
particular let me close out here is when

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:54,890
we go to let's say a phone view here and

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,080
resize things let's say cuz we're gonna

00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,370
want a smaller divide on the phone and

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,740
then we go back up to the larger view

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:06,710
the viewport actually changes what we've

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,299
done based on the switches and the sizes

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,740
here so that way when you're

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,660
manipulating this content on the smaller

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,620
screen it looks the way it's supposed to

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,690
look like on a smaller screen mm-hmm so

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,940
that and that took a lot of effort and

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,150
over here you'll see the actual controls

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,169
for this now we have these different

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,179
like right now I just switched to

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:29,299
earlier in the UI but over here we can

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:32,809
do the same thing for tablet desktop and

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:34,790
also mobile views we could also flip it

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:37,549
if we wanted to put this one on the

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,559
bottom or if we just like to on the X or

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,179
Y axis all these are also available in

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,220
the toolbar because these are pretty

00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:48,679
important I think okay and then another

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,049
cool thing about Guttenberg is that we

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,440
have this new Styles type components

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:56,330
where we can leverage what Gutenberg is

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,280
added to build these really neat styles

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:03,590
that you can flip to on the fly mm-hmm

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,460
it's for anything that runs Gutenberg

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,710
yeah

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,080
and custom post types can even opt in to

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,290
using these as well

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,280
all right so then let's go into the map

00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:19,890
block so here we have the placeholder

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,540
element and this is the initial state of

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,760
the map block we don't have an address

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,170
or anything there we have no custom

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,590
things up here in the toolbar besides

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:34,290
what core adds there for us and let's

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:36,570
type in as Eiffel Tower so now we have

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,160
the Edit location control up here where

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,940
we can swap back here and change it if

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,310
we wanted to and we have the resize of a

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,500
box component wrapped around this entire

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,260
map block so we can resize how tall we

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,540
want this core adds these two right here

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,700
which are wide in full alignment and if

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,950
your theme supports this you can go in

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,460
and toggle those on and build this

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,470
really cool map so the map block is is

00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,420
very interesting because I actually

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,500
built two different plugins there are

00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,090
two different blocks into one

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,190
essentially because right now it's an

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,720
iframe and that GoDaddy

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,240
we're really trying to make things

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,440
simple and as easy as possible so this

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,880
is the best solution if you're just

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,590
going to put your business map on your

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,600
about page but if you wanted to go a

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,390
step further you can go into the

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,290
Advanced Settings here plug in your

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,400
Google Maps API key and things kind of

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,260
look the same over here just a little

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,900
bit different but now we have this new

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:37,890
style selector where we can set the

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,110
style this map in our Advanced Settings

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,650
we can still do our zoom level let's set

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,710
it to 18 here we can set the marker size

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:48,780
if we want it bigger now we have these

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,090
also these are all contextual we have

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,580
all these map controls we can turn off a

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,680
street view right here or let's turn off

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,900
the zoom controls if you want to turn

00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,820
them all off right there so what you

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,260
toggle and now that entire panel is

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,850
missing because we don't need it anymore

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,910
if all of your controls are off we don't

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,680
need all those individual options and

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,390
you can also select the styles from in

00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,850
here and this looks very similar to that

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:16,620
shape divider styles that we created so

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,210
this is basically leveraging a bunch of

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,220
these different patterns all in the same

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,830
manner in order to build this really

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,730
neat experience when using this block

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:37,270
so I'm gonna have any questions about

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:39,940
this block in particular yes in the

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,860
options yeah because if which is neat

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,390
because if you add it once it'll always

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,620
be added on any of your other Matt box

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,750
now correct yep and it defaults to that

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,130
advanced form of the advanced block here

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,720
and this this one isn't released yet

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,030
this advanced version right now it's

00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:03,220
only this version and but we have the

00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:05,799
iframe version coming up soon mm-hmm you

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:13,260
can right now the plug-in is on

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:14,590
wordpress.org mm-hmm that's right here

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,780
right here

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,970
there's a cool video on the showcases a

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,440
bunch of stuff and there's a bunch of

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,490
new plugins in there let's go into I'll

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,630
see how much time do we have

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:31,870
oh wait sweet all right now this block

00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,490
is a little tight on the screen and you

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,940
can almost not see it but right here we

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,200
have a massive placeholder component now

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,270
this placeholder component is

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,820
essentially replicating what I'm gonna

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,240
eventually put there an image so let's

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:51,580
go into this folder right here let's

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:54,730
drop in an image now we have our image

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,200
right here on the Left we have these

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,330
controls at the top here where we can

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,159
manipulate the background we can edit

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,539
the image that we just uploaded it says

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,360
edit media because you can also add

00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:08,380
videos in here and then you can swap

00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,780
this left and right if you'd like now

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,990
for Advanced Options over here on the

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,390
right this is a control that we built

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,250
basically the idea that I like to do the

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,049
same thing that I've explained with the

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,059
map block is to make like a very simple

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,500
way to do something and it advanced way

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,900
for the folks who want something more

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,690
advanced so for let's add a background

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,470
color so we can see this year added a

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,450
background color here now we have

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,880
different variations of padding that we

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,430
can apply here in just the same way

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,230
font sizes and colors work a theme can

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,600
override and set their own padding's

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,730
here and even margins for the same

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,800
control that does margin but if you want

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,840
something more advanced per se you can

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,810
go in here now you can tweak things

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,350
really detailed or you can unsink things

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,600
and say you want to add 100 at the top

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,150
but only in desktop but on tablet you

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,160
want it to be 50 and you can kind of go

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,410
in you can switch it to m's or even

00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,850
percentages or if you're like I don't

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:11,830
know I just broke everything you can hit

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:14,140
reset and it goes back then we have this

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,260
alt text which is a text area component

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,970
built into core as well and this is very

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,030
contextual it only shows up if we have

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,530
an image applied here and we have card

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,690
shadow and image shadow let's turn on

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,690
the image shadow you can't really see it

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:35,740
all right another neat thing that I did

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,540
here which kind of shows like the next

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,790
level of the experience is when you add

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,190
a background color here if your padding

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,860
is set to none it'll automatically set

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,530
it's a medium the idea here is that you

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,600
probably won't want this look here where

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,280
it's like pressed up against the edge so

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm trying to eliminate the issues where

00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,610
you try to do something and it doesn't

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,510
look the way you want it to look and

00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,210
that's you just have to be very

00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,710
thoughtful and try to play around enough

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,270
until you break it to where you can

00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:09,970
eventually fix all the broken pieces

00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:13,500
here and that's the media card block and

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,330
now let's look at the features block

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,400
I'll make this one wide too so this

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,200
one's really unique in the fact that all

00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,070
of these individual pieces here this

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,560
icon for example this heading and this

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,050
paragraph here are all actually blocks

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,180
in themselves I built one wrapper block

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,160
here and then I built a block for each

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,960
of these feature containers and then

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,390
three blocks inside of them we look here

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,120
and select the features block we can see

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,490
exactly how that's laid out and I did

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,440
this because when when other developers

00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,450
and when core improves a heading block

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,910
for example I don't have to do anything

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,260
to also have those same improvements in

00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,880
the features block

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,910
because I'm just adapting and bringing

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,110
those other pieces into this block so

00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,520
when you're building blocks it's really

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,190
important to try to leverage this as

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,710
much as possible for example the heading

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,080
block I added this ability to change the

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:09,360
typography let's change this to play

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:12,880
fair display I will change this one too

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,530
if I had used its own component and used

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,940
to my own attributes and not use the

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,560
heading block then I wouldn't be known

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,600
to do that unless I added that entire

00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,220
all that functionality that goes into

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,870
changing the fonts into this one

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,220
particular block and even then it

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:29,560
wouldn't be as reusable as it is now we

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,130
can also change the headings sizes now

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,610
and in advanced here you also have five

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,610
and six

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:42,040
now these icon blocks are really

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,510
interesting because this is all another

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,910
custom block I built but all of this

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,500
here resembles the exact same patterns

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,300
I've already been doing the simple and

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,630
then the advanced simple gives you a

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,940
couple of size options here and if you

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:58,690
click advanced you can also now resize

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,640
it in detail a neat little touch here is

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,580
if you're using the block content area

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,380
to directly manipulate this icon it'll

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,040
automatically switch to the advanced

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,690
size over here so again that's just

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,430
being very thoughtful of what's

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,650
happening so that when they go to the

00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,450
settings it doesn't say small and you

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,920
have a random size that you decided B

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,940
and you wouldn't know how to apply that

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,890
same size to the next icon we also built

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,050
this search component here to search for

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,150
icons and this is leveraging various

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,980
components within core I'm using the

00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,970
search field using each of these icons

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:38,040
to pull in different icons so we can

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:42,340
click globe we can search for security

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,680
you can resize it like we'd like let's

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,750
go if we decide that we want to do a

00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,820
music note and we want it to be a field

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:53,350
icon this is using the same styles

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,940
components that guttenberg provides and

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,200
now all of these icons are the filled

00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,200
versions of themselves

00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:05,399
and once you have an icon here and you

00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:08,070
like it and decide to change its color

00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,989
you can tweak it here you can set its

00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,789
own custom color again this is using the

00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:14,070
same exact color palette that we used in

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:17,070
the shape divider and it's within the

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,419
color settings panel - all the same can

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,440
add a background color which

00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,459
automatically added a padding to this

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,249
and then we would go up here now we have

00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:29,119
these new contextual options to tweak

00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:31,649
this icons background now that we have

00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,059
the the background color assigned to it

00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:40,440
otherwise it wouldn't be necessary to

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:42,599
change the radius of this icon so that

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,089
kind of showcases a bunch of different

00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,829
UX principles and patterns and all the

00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:49,769
different core components that go into

00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:51,450
building block experiences and then go

00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:53,700
in a step further and thinking about

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,320
finding ways to make sure that when you

00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,419
do something it doesn't break and then

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,599
it doesn't give you this like what did I

00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,169
do

00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,759
like reset everything kind of idea so

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:07,759
there's that there are any questions

00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,759
yeah

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:16,629
now the one I built probably okay so

00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,159
collogues

00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:30,020
mm-hmm it's on the road pressed org

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:35,750
slash plugins / co' box.org exactly yep

00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:38,089
yes I'm assuming you use react to build

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,040
the bars correct yes you still use other

00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:46,310
JavaScript frameworks I know they were

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:47,659
saying usually you can but it's you it's

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,099
almost better to go ahead and try

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,050
learning because it should all the

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,879
resources are now in react and it's just

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:59,240
it'd be much more difficult kind of

00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:03,200
backtracking a little bit with their

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:06,109
block builder I'm I've kind of you know

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,349
experience-wise its when the solution is

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:10,490
not as clear and clever and as precise

00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,990
as what you can build when you're

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,810
understanding the patterns and building

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:16,460
within these principles but to get

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:22,300
started quickly it works really

00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,300
relatively well thank you yes

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,800
[Music]

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,900
probably not advisable because Gutenberg

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,360
what Davy does is it kind of wraps its

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,280
own layer on top of things so if you use

00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,720
Gutenberg it's not going to use what you

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,580
have in divvy it's kind of they're

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,260
almost just one of the other pretty much

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:53,710
same with beaver builder the same with

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:59,740
elementary I mean I'm not super super

00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:06,220
familiar but mm-hmm oh yeah yeah you did

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:08,020
ask me that yeah she asked if about the

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,480
genesis question if she had asked it

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,580
already if you if you could use

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,580
Gutenberg with Genesis you can

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,800
well if you find a theme that works

00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:34,460
great with Guttenberg it should work

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,630
great with these other plugins right

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,800
exactly

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:50,420
because if because when we're building

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:52,340
these plugins I mean I think in the long

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:58,190
tail they might adapt to be more

00:36:52,340 --> 00:37:00,619
Gutenberg friendly it could be yes yeah

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,450
it could be as long as everyone follows

00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:04,340
these patterns and uses these components

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,470
and and we have this maybe we have this

00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,310
chance to really push WordPress in a new

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:12,849
direction of usability yes that was our

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,849
question yes

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:26,430
I usually get designers who want us to

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,430
force beams and things to do

00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:54,360
yes you can extend other blocks and in

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,460
like Kobach's makes a few of its

00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,010
functionalities extendable for other

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,690
blocks to inherit as well so you can you

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,120
can kind of play off of that and then

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,000
you can also go in here into the

00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,760
advanced panel here you can add classes

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,280
and then target them if you're gonna do

00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:18,620
anything special yeah and you can add

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,620
multiple classes here yes yes yes I

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,130
think so yes

00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:39,000
yeah well you always need a theme at

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,920
least for the next foreseeable future I

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,450
think things are changing and what is a

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,580
theme is gonna be very different in a

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,230
couple years but your theme will depicts

00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:53,700
what your website looks like to an

00:38:46,230 --> 00:39:08,220
extent mm-hmm right they just come with

00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:11,370
a theme correct I would yes yes and this

00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,870
is 2019 a year and everything or most of

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,280
what we do here will look just the same

00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,140
on the front end because they've gone

00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,510
into really detail to make sure that

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,910
otherwise Scouten burg looks very simple

00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:25,380
and like a almost like a Word document

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:27,770
and not as dynamic and as clean correct

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,770
yes

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:40,440
there are any other questions alright

00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:46,099
well thank you guys

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,099
