Title: Victor Ramirez: Managing 50+ Custom Enterprise Plugins in the Age of Gutenberg

Description: 
	I recently joined Dow Jones as a WP developer. I discovered not everyone was a WP developer but PHP or other developers who did some WordPress. I had to figure out how to win adoption of ‘the WordPress way’ across multiple countries, devs, stakeholders, & online publications. We also had to make sure that legacy plugins, tools, etc kept up with the new changes of WordPress 5. I’ll share how I won adoption and coordination by using Git for collaboration, regularly scheduled meetings (without death by meetings), & creating standards. I’ll also give a peek at pitfalls to avoid when trying to work within org that never did remote before & worked with multiple outside agencies.
