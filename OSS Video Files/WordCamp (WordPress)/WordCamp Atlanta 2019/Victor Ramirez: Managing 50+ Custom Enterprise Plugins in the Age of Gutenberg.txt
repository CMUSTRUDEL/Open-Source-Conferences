Title: Victor Ramirez: Managing 50+ Custom Enterprise Plugins in the Age of Gutenberg
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	I recently joined Dow Jones as a WP developer. I discovered not everyone was a WP developer but PHP or other developers who did some WordPress. I had to figure out how to win adoption of ‘the WordPress way’ across multiple countries, devs, stakeholders, & online publications. We also had to make sure that legacy plugins, tools, etc kept up with the new changes of WordPress 5. I’ll share how I won adoption and coordination by using Git for collaboration, regularly scheduled meetings (without death by meetings), & creating standards. I’ll also give a peek at pitfalls to avoid when trying to work within org that never did remote before & worked with multiple outside agencies.

all right Victor Ramirez is the John

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,750
Smith Latino names so if you google me

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,269
that's alright just like Victor Ramirez

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,240
WordPress and I'll show up cool

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,590
so this talk was this is the title that

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,230
I used it was like the catchy headline

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,869
but just I could tell by the room that I

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,590
scared people away so it's I would just

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,859
wanna preface

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,750
it's not scary at all the talk if I

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,310
could have put a subtext below it was

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,349
like what I've learned in enterprise

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,179
that can benefit everyone right so I'm

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,759
going to keep this simple but if you are

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,579
a developer you will gain some great

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,280
insights from this so what do I mean

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,500
when I say Enterprise so I am the lead

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,700
software engineer at Dow Jones and I'm

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,969
currently on the wall street journal

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
editorial project and I didn't have a

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,079
job there a year ago about a year ago

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,610
they recruited me and they had said they

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,579
came to me and said do you want a job I

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,350
said no then they said well what if we

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,350
tell you about the job and the job is to

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,520
unify our WordPress systems not only

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,940
starting with the Wall Street Journal

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,610
but across all our publications in

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,010
Australia the UK South Africa Bangalore

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,229
all over the world and have a unified

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,030
WordPress system and set of tools so I

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,470
was like ok cool I'll take that job and

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,170
it pays so yeah

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,720
money is important right and so I'm also

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,900
the founder at an abstract agency that's

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
my small little WordPress marketing shop

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,189
I still have it and that was you know

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,720
when I worked at Dow Jones I said hey I

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,310
still want to be able to be involved in

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,680
the community and give back the way I'm

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,570
kind of doing this now and then I'm a

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,820
mentor at thankful code nation and

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,130
all-star code which is I teach kids and

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,110
adults to code in various ways so this

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,229
has kind of helped my job and helped me

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,149
kind of distill things for people to

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,659
really get it and then finally I'm a co

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,540
organizer at WP my see Meetup and word

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,630
camp NYC this year so yeah so that's me

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,430
and then besides going on my talk rocks

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,770
I would love if you went on Twitter or

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,420
Instagram so if you like something if

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,409
you quote if you whatever I would love

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,299
if you tweeted at me

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,759
it helps me let me know that people are

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,780
liking what I'm saying and getting it if

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,910
you don't get it you start to fall

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,590
asleep I will catch you and I will

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,450
change course and try to make it more

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,950
entertaining cool and then

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,890
this is one of the things I have to say

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,930
now this is 100% my personal and

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,640
professional opinion nothing I say or

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,470
present today has anything to do with

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,420
news corporate subsidiaries and whatever

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,210
a legal person would say I have to put

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,480
that there just see you guys now okay

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,200
cool

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,490
lawyers are happy so this and everyone's

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,070
this mean probably wouldn't fund here

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,900
last year but and Game of Thrones it's

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,990
ending boo hope to make it home tonight

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,060
to see it but this was the kind of like

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,239
the crux of the problem at The Wall

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,040
Street Journal and for our new future

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,150
CMS we are going to be using Gutenberg

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,110
wonder-percent

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,600
and Gutenberg you know aside from being

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,750
part of the new WordPress 5.0 and beyond

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,760
its modern JavaScript and if you're

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,200
working in modern JavaScript who here by

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,750
the way works in modern JavaScript like

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,160
with node react etc raise your hand kind

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,120
of okay cool I see some like half hands

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,220
all right perfect

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,670
it can be complicated and if you're a

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,220
PHP developer trying to move your way

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,709
into JavaScript and react

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,840
the wider you go and the more

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,190
applications you're working on it can

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,239
get really complicated to maintain

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,160
because it's changing so quickly so what

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,870
I'm going to cover I'm going to talk

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,620
about how to think about standardization

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,630
one of the solutions to solve as you go

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,209
and you try to work in modern JavaScript

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,560
development is standardization and I

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,570
would say there is some standardization

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,880
in the WordPress space but there needs

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,380
to be more standardization if you want

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,630
to succeed with modern JavaScript

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,579
development the other thing on a cover

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,980
is I'm going to share some examples of

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,920
real problems I've encountered working

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,680
in enterprise JavaScript and WordPress

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,060
and how I solve those and then finally

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,090
I'm going to give some basic tools and

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,019
recommendations that are that weather no

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,519
matter if you're if you're not a

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,110
developer or you're someone who works

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,930
with developers or you are a developer

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,540
you can use these to standardize your

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,200
processes and really succeed with

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,780
Gutenberg

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,900
so this is just a preface for non

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,519
developers does everyone know what C ICD

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,180
is raise your hand high if you really

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,810
understand CIC dok2 three perfect that's

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,780
perfect

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,889
whoo when I say see ICD who has no idea

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,819
what I'm talking about

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,020
and I'm proud perfect okay cool so see

00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,270
ICD is a buzzword

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,129
but it also is a real word and it stands

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,900
for continuous integration and

00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:42,370
deployment and what it actually means is

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,840
imagine that you and everyone here I'm

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,319
assuming has written a blog post or use

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,759
WordPress before right so imagine if you

00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,310
every time that someone wrote a blog

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,830
post and they forgot a headline they

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,389
forgot the SEO keyword they forgot to

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,219
spellcheck they forgot to do any of

00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,979
those things when they went to click

00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:01,629
publish it was rejected and a

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:03,490
notification came up and told them

00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:04,389
everything they forgot to do but it

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,840
saved it as a draft

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,740
that's what CIC D is for code when a

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,180
developer goes and submits their code a

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,909
series of tests so this is like our

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,759
little developer friend and he submits

00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:21,189
his code and you see the little X's it's

00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,259
boo he didn't pass it and then he did

00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:24,819
pass the test and then it moves to the

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,400
next stage and it goes to the server and

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,960
the benefit of that is instead of you as

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,240
the senior developer the senior

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,159
stakeholder or the DevOps team instead

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,500
of having to continuously and make sure

00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,150
people follow standards it's like a bot

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,520
going and checking all these standards

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,770
and it automates that deployment process

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,659
so what that means is like it's less

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,250
headaches for you and I'm as I get

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,500
through standards this will make a lot

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,939
of sense and I like to call it just for

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,409
my stakeholders I try to break

00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,479
everything because I work with a not a

00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,370
lot of non-technical stakeholders I'm

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,419
across many different places many

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,580
different cultures many different

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,009
languages and I just call it automated

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,490
QA on steroids and that's what CIC D is

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:05,199
right so I'm gonna go through some

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,539
concepts first about how to think about

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,589
standards and then it will make set and

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:12,219
then hopefully they'll it'll help you

00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:15,069
make sense of the next two sections so

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:17,080
when you're building a WordPress website

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,500
the one thing that I've really pushed is

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,750
that when in my opinion when you build a

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,419
WordPress website you want a fleet

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,289
vehicle not a race car so what do I mean

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:32,159
by a fleet vehicle the Toyota Camry if

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:36,009
you go to New York City every single

00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:38,529
uber I'd say like 90% of yellow cabs are

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,389
its hodie Camry and the Toyota Camry is

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,710
one of the most stolen vehicles

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,430
in the United States and there's a

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:48,699
reason for that they're 22 $40,000 which

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,409
is a reasonable price right Toyota when

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,259
they build the car they use the Kanban

00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:55,539
process they actually have a and

00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,129
actually Kanban was invented by Toyota

00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,389
so if you guys like Trello JIRA any of

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,669
those things people don't realize this

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,139
this is literally before the 70s people

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,849
were just smashing rocks together and

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,060
hoping things would be bill then someone

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,740
invented Kanban right one model per

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,990
factory when they build a Toyota Camry

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,159
they only build one thing table decor

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,659
I think they build a car here in Georgia

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,039
I don't know I don't know but they build

00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:19,060
a Toyota they build a Sienna each

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,849
factory builds one model of one car om

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,639
standards only when they go in if you go

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:26,409
and like put some crazy you know 30 inch

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
muffler that makes your car sound like a

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,860
bass drum going down the street you

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,419
voided your warranty and you don't get

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,750
the hundred thousand mile Toyota

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,150
warranty right and there's a warranty

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,250
life expectancy so you know exactly this

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,469
car when you buy a Toyota Camry it's

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,389
gonna last you 10 to 15 years good for a

00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,949
hundred thousand miles and that's great

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,569
and that's how a website should be right

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,580
shouldn't our websites we can say like

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,349
okay this was built right even if my

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,000
theme breaks I can swap out any theme

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,669
because it was built the WordPress way

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,020
and therefore like it's easy to maintain

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,550
but that's not how people build websites

00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,949
that's not how hotshot developers build

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,690
websites oh and by the way limited

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,479
specialization for staff through a rock

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,150
you're gonna head a Toyota dry oil

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,469
mechanic right this is a hot rods Erbil

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,089
they're fifty thousand to two hundred

00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,129
fifty thousand dollars and you know

00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,589
people like to write big checks they're

00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,779
built to spec fully custom one or two

00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:18,460
vehicles per garage not product ties so

00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,589
meaning like they're only building one

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,259
or two vehicles may be a backup vehicle

00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,729
for when they go and race right there's

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,960
no standards and there shouldn't be

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,879
standards right if I'm trying to win a

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
NASCAR race and win a Formula One we

00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,150
have to like throw everything we can

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,469
every idea throw some nos in there I

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,409
don't know pixie dust wherever else they

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,120
used right and there's no warranty when

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,320
you go and like blow a gasket or like

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,969
you know flip your car or whatever you

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,709
do you can't take it to the Toyota

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,229
repair shop you have to call an

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:45,699
extremely specialized pit crew and this

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,560
is real math I went and checked out how

00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,790
much does a pit crew to maintain a pit

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,130
crews a half million to 1 million

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,630
dollars a year because they're Union in

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,980
some states and you can't just you can't

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,050
just call them hey man come on

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,600
my pit crew no you need to maintain a

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,670
specialized pique group of developers

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,320
and that's where I get to most people

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,420
including enterprise they build their

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,370
websites like hot rods and that's like

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,269
I'm all for that if you're that if you

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,410
have the budget but when outside of Dow

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,449
Jones when people come to me and they

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,970
say my budgets only ten thousand dollars

00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,230
over the next two years I put them on

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,329
something like a framework like theme

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,220
beans or Genesis because I say you don't

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:23,589
have a developer you don't have a

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,790
development team and therefore you don't

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,320
want to have to call it pick crew to

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,550
maintain it you want to go to throw rock

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,269
in Brooklyn and find someone that knows

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,790
how to use this thing right second you

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,529
can't just hire smart people hiring

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,910
smart people is not a way to solve a

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,970
problem and what do I mean by that

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,370
Google this if you want to be horrified

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,649
doctors don't wash their hands

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,329
notoriously it's a notorious problem in

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,620
the United States healthcare system it's

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,480
a notorious problem in Western medicine

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,579
in Eastern Europe what they are now

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,320
doing in some hospitals is they make

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:55,029
doctors do UV spray they get sprayed

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,410
with UV paint they have to come off and

00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,870
wash your hands that why do doctors not

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,130
wash their hands because they're people

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,959
you know they're people they're just

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,790
like us right they go on the golf course

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,209
they hit like 18 holes they're feeling

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,350
hot

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,880
they're awesome they got to get in there

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,160
and do some brain surgery so instead of

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,600
doing the the quick they do a quick wash

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,620
right and they think they're good

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,430
because they're a doctor they're smart

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,110
they didn't touch anything when they

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,750
came in but that leads to contamination

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,579
and people chain people just forget

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,470
things all the time right life changes

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,839
career changes opportunity changes

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,970
financial changes passion changes you

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,870
have a doctor and or a developer who

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,459
just you know they just don't care

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,440
anymore because you know they're moving

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,930
to their next job right so that's what

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
you need standards the other thing is

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,269
people have different definitions of

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,250
standards stakeholders how do we benefit

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,769
organizations can we maintain it

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,699
developers do I understand it users does

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,040
this meet my needs

00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,050
vendors what is the scope they want to

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,370
maintain that tight scope right and if

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,139
you don't define these standards in the

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,990
beginning all of these people are not

00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:54,250
going to be happy finally the other

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,680
concept that I try to push with

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,880
standards is trust but verify so that

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,069
just goes back to the thing of the

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,449
hand-washing like you even though a

00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,649
doctors look doctors are really smart

00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,420
people they go to school for eight to

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,870
ten years but they won't wash your hand

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,820
so

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,930
when anyone says to me we hired really

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,320
smart developers if you don't need any

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,330
of this

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,190
I say doctors don't wash their hands did

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,210
you hire a bunch of doctors they're

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,740
still not gonna do what you told them to

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,160
do because that's just how life is

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,600
right so trust but verify and for

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,680
further reading I really recommend these

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,230
two books to the e-myth by Michael

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,030
Gerber and the art of the steal by Frank

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,620
Abagnale which is if anyone saw catch me

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,390
if you can that's actually his business

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,400
book that he wrote on how to catch

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,900
people stealing and people don't have

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
the crux of the book is people don't

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,380
steal because people are bad people

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,160
steal because of opportunity and people

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:46,810
change that's it so let me go through

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,310
some real problems problem number one no

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,170
definition of standards this is one of

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,940
the first things I run into and and

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,800
again outside of Dow Jones I work with

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,050
other agencies in New York City I

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,820
consult startups and I work with some

00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,350
accelerators and the number one thing I

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,950
find is there's they never take the time

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:06,130
to define the standards and so just real

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,020
quick math you know if you have imagine

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,350
that you're maintaining 10 organization

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,000
websites right 10 CMS's and maybe you

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,710
farm it out to five different vendors

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,570
and you end up with 30 different

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,960
developers over the course of a year you

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:23,200
have unlimited outcomes right and that's

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,720
dangerous so one of the things we did

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,250
was we went in internally you need to

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,780
internally define standards so for

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,920
example and people always say well our

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,650
developer is going to define the

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,180
standards well which developer right and

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,100
and if you're not a developer and you

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,600
need to define standards work with a

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,670
developer to find the standards but

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,060
don't just let them go carp launch right

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,700
and the same thing Toyota doesn't let

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,320
the fact the parts that the the part

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,850
companies define the standards they

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,380
define the standards the OEM standards

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,940
and they say this is how our mufflers

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,270
fit this is how this fit this is how

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,540
this fits right so the solution for us

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,740
is an SME sorry subject matter experts

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,570
which are myself and a couple other

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,790
people on our team we're continually

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,160
reviewing friction points caused by bad

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,140
standards and adapt in sprints so we

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,790
work in sprint cycles every two weeks

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,200
we're going back through all you know we

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,000
kind of did what do we learned Charlie

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,280
Brown and say hey what do we do wrong

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,690
what was a problem it took like we had

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,250
to have three hours of conversations

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,200
just to understand how this API worked

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,260
right and that's one of the things that

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,940
drives me nuts sometimes

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,050
we'll give us a plug in and they'll say

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,550
well any developer can really figure

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,830
that out and I go it took me three hours

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,450
to figure that out yet I went to

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,510
Google's and by the if you guys don't

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,070
know Google has a machine-learning free

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,260
open-source software called tensorflow

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,970
in about one hour I built a machine

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,310
learning bot that picked movies for me

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,720
without ever calling Google yet it took

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,040
me three hours to understand how a

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,020
simple Guttenberg block work from an

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,070
agency do you see the do you see that

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,970
the disconnect their neck next

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,580
definitions have done this is another

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,080
problem I run into we have ten different

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,600
teams work a lot of vendors we have

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,090
teams all over the world and these ten

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,770
different teams built plug-ins and every

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,450
single one of them were missing an item

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,580
and what I'm actively working on for us

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,920
is what is the definition of done for a

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,900
plugin right and this is my growing

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,570
definition of a complete plug-in a

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,430
github repo with organizational owner

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,230
permissions you'll be amazed how many

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,030
people we forget when we adapt the

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,670
plug-in we don't have owner permissions

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,150
on the github repo clearly defined file

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,800
header

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,060
there's file headers we're just like you

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,710
know the WordPress file header when you

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,300
make a plug-in or a theme it defines

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,280
what the link is and you know it says

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,230
like visit here we now have a link to

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,970
our own internal intranet to say to

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,500
people hey if you need help or you know

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,910
you want like so you can add those

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,130
things before there were just generic

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,140
the links that went nowhere right a

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,080
complete readme for the lowest common

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,670
denominator so what I always say is and

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,470
that goes back to the tensorflow thing I

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,390
can learn machine I can do machine

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,710
learning in two hours but it takes me

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,170
like five hours to figure out what your

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,030
plugin does right and that's a problem

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,100
and now do that times you know thirty

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,860
developers 100 developers different team

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,420
members right and so when I say make a

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,070
readme so we have to figure out what

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,360
kind of stakeholder look at this and

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,940
understand how his team could use this

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,590
plug-in branching structure so making

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,240
sure that you know sometimes developers

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,310
they'll commit everything to the main

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
master branch right and so we defined

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,600
that we have a dev a QA and production

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,010
and I have some resources if anyone's

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,990
not working in that kind of workflow at

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,370
the end of this but yeah so making sure

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,000
you have proper branching structure for

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,560
our plugins a defined style in eslint so

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,600
remember ice so if you guys aren't non

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,790
developers if you guys remember I said

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,020
hey like if they to forget a word or

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,510
they forget this and they forget that

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,070
you know have those standards you can

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,230
define a style in ES lint or

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,209
and on a plug-in basis so that no matter

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,949
who pulls the plug in they get your

00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,509
coding standards your linting standards

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:45,720
by default when they pull it into their

00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:48,209
development environment clearly defined

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,310
directory structure so and you know

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,759
going back one slide if you remember we

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,829
had 10 different teams I'd say out of

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,370
let's say this is like 6 out of the

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:01,589
plugins that we pulled in out of those

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,509
10 plugins all of them only had maybe

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,800
two of these and then have these so that

00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,779
was like when I joined the company I was

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,040
a while that's insane right and in

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,540
growing right like what else do you need

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,130
now we want to put maybe put a video

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,829
demonstration of how the UI works put a

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,199
Jif in there put other things in there

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:18,149
and the solution again internally every

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,649
time after one of our you know sprints

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,149
we're actively going and looking at it

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,860
and saying like ok what else can we

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,430
improve on what needs to be there set

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,100
around problem 3 trust but verify this

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,360
is a very common problem and that's it

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,310
there's that's the problem people man

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,110
they just like they just don't care and

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,149
there's you know and people like it's a

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,910
Friday night we have a code push and you

00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,800
know there's a hot movie going on you

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,670
know like end game just came out people

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,829
got to see that right whatever and so we

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,319
have you know we have a culture now of

00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:50,760
code reviews we're actively we're like

00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,839
working with each development team and

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,240
making sure reviewing each other's code

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,740
and giving honest feedback we're doing

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,110
testing which I spoke about before a

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,300
little bit and then in that testing is

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,370
integrated with our CI CD where before a

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,049
developer can even push the code into

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,569
our get every boats being tested by our

00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:10,199
CI CD system and we're rejecting invalid

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,089
pull requests problem number four that

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,220
we're running into and this is a problem

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,900
that Gutenberg is having overall so if

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,339
you're interesting contributing we're

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,909
actually starting to contribute on this

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,530
as well is maintaining dependencies who

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:25,319
here is built a Guttenberg block by the

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,750
way raise your hand one two that's it

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,880
guys it's super easy like it is actually

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,950
super easy to build a block there's this

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,110
great thing called a crate gutten block

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,919
you can get a block up and running in

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,990
like five minutes

00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,880
the problem is keeping that block

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:43,790
running beyond those five minutes and

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,990
the room and and the reason for that is

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,960
Gutenberg is changing so quickly

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,140
javascript is changing so quickly

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,880
security is

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,610
changing so quickly everything and

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,650
that's what CI CD is by the way CI CD is

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,240
that you know you're a big enterprise

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,150
organization something like Netflix

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,740
right Netflix gets a call from you know

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,270
one of the developers and they say uh-oh

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,010
there's like a zero-day exploit that

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,230
just came out and we have to solve that

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,360
problem and patch the bug and the way

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,310
development used to work was okay get

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,660
the team together next week and then in

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,570
a month we're gonna talk about it and

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,370
well whereas now you can patch that bug

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,600
run it through all your tests and make

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,490
sure it doesn't blow up your system and

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,470
in two hours patch that bug and have it

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,970
fixed that's the benefit of CI CD you're

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,610
not waiting for these big teams to get

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,770
together but the problem that that

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,850
brings is that you have to figure out

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,190
how to maintain so let me try to think

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,750
has anyone them composer with PHP raise

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,650
your hand composer a couple composer

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,510
people okay cool

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,060
so when you when you go and run like

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,640
composer update right NPM is the same

00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,080
thing for node right when you go and run

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,900
that you see what dependencies are at a

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,390
date when and guys it from non composer

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,650
NPM people when you guys you know if

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,280
you're if you're working properly in

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,530
WordPress

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,210
you go and WooCommerce and Ettore for

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,830
this notorious for this you don't go

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,990
update your plugins on your production

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,880
site you go to your staging site you

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,340
update your plugins cross your fingers

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,440
and if everything works you go update on

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,210
the other site that's what that's what

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,800
you're doing with react react has when

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,170
you go and build a Guttenberg block it

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,240
might have twenty to fifty dependencies

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,170
and then each of those dependencies have

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
up to seven hundred to eight hundred

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,530
dependencies so literally you know at

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
one point we're dealing with 800 to a

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,590
thousand dependencies per block but

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
that's not really explain why it's not a

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,480
problem because so if you think about it

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,730
each each block is potentially its own

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,770
react tab so you're ten organizations

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,930
and you might have ten organizations of

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,640
ten custom blocks so one hundred

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,380
different configurations right and

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,610
that's a kitten so think about if in a

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,980
wordpress site it's a configuration

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,920
that's similar in composer and npm it's

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,600
a configuration but this problem has

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,920
been solved we got to get outside the

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,570
wordpress space that's another thing i

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,430
recommend get go to an on word press

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,590
conference go to an on WordPress meetup

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,880
talk to non WordPress people I'm very

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,300
lucky in New York City we have a big

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,640
react scene angular etc but one of the

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,350
things I found in my research was PayPal

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,500
had this problem only a year ago they

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,420
dissolved it

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,640
so when you guys configure by the way in

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,120
a in composer it's composed about JSON

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,670
in your in your WordPress site you've a

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,370
WP config that defines certain things in

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:21,520
JavaScript it's a web pack right at one

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:22,900
point PayPal had 635 web packs 897 babel

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,970
files and five thousand six hundred

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,740
fifty seven different es lence my wrists

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,660
public is lint it's just a style file

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,150
right that's insane

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,250
ken ken Dodds he went and said that what

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,080
he said was if I if we do the math if it

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,210
takes one hour to disseminate how to use

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,920
that configuration and one hour to

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,010
maintain that configuration annually

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,860
they're burning a lot of money right now

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,930
do that math you have 100 blocks right

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,340
or you know custom blocks etc or

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,350
different clients you build a custom

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,300
block for a hundred clients that's 100

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,670
things you have to maintain but the

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,570
solution is to move towards a singular

00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:01,900
dependency so in if you go and develop

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,820
in react or in PayPal they have you can

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,700
set a singular dependency and that

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,560
dependency manages all the scripts for

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,940
you it comes with a preset configuration

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,850
unless you have to do really something

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,080
really custom but most blocks you know

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,730
some blocks are just things we're like

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,350
it makes a heading and it makes a

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,490
paragraph and has a button that's not

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,530
really anything outside of the

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,840
boundaries of standard HTML it's not

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,520
calling an external API it's not doing

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,740
any crazy like testing and configuration

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,570
it's just HTML right so why would you

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,800
even advanced configuration and so

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,240
WordPress actually is trying to solve

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,370
this problem they have a package called

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,800
WP scripts and you just do MPM install

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,660
you install one singer dependency and

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,090
then you never have to touch that block

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,040
again and you just update WP scripts you

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,530
NPM update and just run that one test

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,480
there and we don't even do that we just

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,310
literally have our CI CD just goes and

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,690
runs it and if we get a test back that

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,090
has like it kicks back we just go and

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,830
modify whatever we need to modify so so

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,940
that's that's great and if you want WP

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,380
scripts we're trying to contribute to

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,540
that they're moving towards a single

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,640
dependency to make it easier for people

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,470
in the WordPress community to learn

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,790
react because the number one problem

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,130
that people are having learning

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:10,630
guttenberg is just JavaScript can be a

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:13,120
nightmare problem number problem number

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,449
five that I had stakeholders just don't

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,359
care

00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:19,219
they immediately say like whoa you want

00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,959
us to like go and like make Reid knees

00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:23,569
and make this and make that when does

00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:24,739
the work get done right that's like kind

00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:27,979
of like how client you know they feel

00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:29,959
about it and luckily again like in my

00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,519
research I was able to like that you

00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:33,949
know people like Kent C Dodds at PayPal

00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,909
people out like you know at react and

00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:36,979
what's happening in the Guttenberg

00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:41,299
community it was an easy thing it was

00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:43,069
simple math so if you you know if you as

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,119
a even like a small agency if you're a

00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:46,489
small agency if you're a small company

00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,749
if you're maintaining you know five

00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:49,729
different let's say you just have five

00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:50,929
clients right and all five of those

00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,969
clients were built with a custom

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,979
underscores theme and they have a custom

00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:56,719
Guttenberg block and they have a custom

00:22:54,979 --> 00:23:00,289
plug-in or two if you don't maintain

00:22:56,719 --> 00:23:01,879
your standards and you try to hire your

00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,619
and that's like I meet a lot of people

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,719
who essentially say like I can't hire

00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:07,069
anyone don't trust anyone oh I can't

00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,929
hire anyone they can't do it right

00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,909
you're you're essentially you bought

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,929
yourself the worst job ever right like

00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,359
you're never gonna go to take a vacation

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,949
right and that's the benefit of this

00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,749
stuff like you know I just went I went

00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:19,669
to smoke at wordcamp Madrid and I was

00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:20,929
gone for two weeks and nothing exploded

00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:22,699
right and I was like and that was

00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,779
awesome and that's like I think everyone

00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,729
should have that ability and as a

00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:28,249
developer sometimes you become such a

00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:29,449
linchpin which is a great thing but you

00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:30,889
don't want to become such a linchpin

00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,049
that you're literally overnight losing

00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:34,969
sleep about these things and then for

00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,829
the stakeholders I just had to show them

00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:38,449
guys we're gonna have in our you know in

00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,639
our roadmap we might have 100 blocks

00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:42,949
eventually that are all custom if we

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,269
have 100 configs 100 hours annually and

00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:45,529
then we have to go and explained

00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:47,479
everything these vendors you know we

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:49,579
work with WordPress development agencies

00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:51,439
we have to what spend 10 hours to

00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:53,329
explain to these guys like how to use

00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:54,799
our standards or how to adapt their

00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:56,899
standards and you know if they're

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,969
charging 200 an hour that's $2,000 every

00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,409
time we want to go and explain so you

00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:04,069
know it's hundreds of thousands a year

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,109
that were saving so here are the tools

00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,339
and assets that we're building we are

00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:09,169
going to be open sourcing some of them

00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,039
so follow me on Twitter hopefully at the

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,869
end of the year we're gonna have some of

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,689
these available but the other thing to

00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,639
remember is anyone can build these tools

00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:19,279
just listen to Picasso is my favorite

00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:22,759
saying good artists borrow great artists

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,239
steal they're like I did not invent any

00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:25,069
of this

00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,410
I literally just listen and I'm like

00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,180
koto apparent like I just listen and I

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,900
like repeat what I hear right of course

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,100
I like filter it sometimes but I didn't

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,330
think of any of these I just looked at

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,820
was going on in the development world

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,140
and I said wow I learned tensorflow

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,880
machine learning in one hour because

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,040
they'd a great readme YouTube video and

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
accompanying blog post maybe we should

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,610
make that for Gutenberg right and so

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,830
what we've done is we've created a

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,860
readme boilerplate someone comes in and

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,910
says hey what do you read me standards

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,370
here you go

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,870
video at the top or a jiff this you know

00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,220
has to have a heading and one of the

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,200
other benefits too of a really great

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,290
read me you guys may not realize this

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,850
but you guys noticed like the

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,670
wordpress.org repository for the plugins

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,140
all of them have like a nice heading a

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,520
nice text nice whatever do you think

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,370
someone's manually going and writing

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,500
that in no it pulls from the readme

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,930
because there's a standardized readme

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,240
format that is required to submit to the

00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,430
wordpress.org repo so because we have

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,380
standardized our vide me now we have our

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,880
own intranet site where any stakeholder

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,590
can go in and view all the plugins that

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,510
you have in assets that are available so

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,210
any developer that comes on I just tell

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,140
them go to our intranet and then for

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,060
your plug-in we have a plug-in

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,430
boilerplate which includes our PHP CS

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,530
our styling our es lint and or any other

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,540
configurations so that way when someone

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,950
comes in they fire up the IDE they pull

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,410
down the plug-in and it auto configures

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,570
for vs code or phpstorm whichever one

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,490
they want to use we have a Guttenberg

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,320
plug-in boilerplate that uses WP scripts

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,730
the singular dependency we have that

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,020
well documented and tell people how to

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,180
fire it up what files they need to

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,030
change etc we have a theme boilerplate

00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,740
we do not use a framework we do have our

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,040
own theme that we have a theme

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,810
boilerplate at my company but I prefer

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,030
Genesis so again thinking about a

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,700
standard theme or framework that you can

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,190
use to build off of and then we have a

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,300
CMS handbook and knowledge base a lot of

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,220
it just links to standard WordPress

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,480
stuff but there are certain things where

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,570
we have different standards that we have

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,370
defined and then the other thing we you

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,350
don't have this but again defining it

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,660
for some smaller teams I just recommend

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,400
using a local by flywheel or vvv but

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,230
making sure you're all in the same thing

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,660
like I get it developers have their

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,430
preferences in my my personal company

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,900
abstract I do have some people who are

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,460
like I prefer this and like that's cool

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm not paying you for that I'm paying

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,430
you for this and so use this standard I

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,810
don't and if you have to do the work

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,100
they remove it over that's on you but

00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,930
I'm not paying you for that right and

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,970
that and that's like something you know

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,340
it is it was get to get some hard

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,830
medicine sometimes and then these are

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,840
our standard processes we have our dev

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,660
workflow which is again when a developer

00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,780
commits code it gets tested and put it

00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,670
into dev a dev environment and then once

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,790
that's tested there and it passes then

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,830
it goes to QA in QA we do integration or

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,350
aggression testing and then once it

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,620
passes that we go to production we use

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,700
Jenkins for our CI CD so remember I said

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,530
to you guys like before for non

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
developers like it's essentially some

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,710
system that will go through and check

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,290
you could Jenkins is it's like a

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,610
scripting system and same with Travis

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,920
you write these scripts and these

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,540
commands and have it run these tests and

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,830
it will do those things will reject and

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,840
you or you it doesn't have to reject you

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,350
can have hard pass soft pass different

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,000
things we do unit testing regret again

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,120
like I said regression testing and

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,140
that's just making sure that oh sorry

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,390
regression testing just making sure that

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,250
anything that you know work before it

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,150
works now integration testing is putting

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,010
it and making sure that you know all

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,740
doing actual live testing and making

00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,540
sure it works with everything and these

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,310
are some resources there was actually a

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,280
great talk about the technical side of

00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,960
this you may not have gone but one of

00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,340
the guys from WP engine automating

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,830
WordPress development with Chris Weidman

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,120
that guy that actually everything I kind

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,700
of learned about see ICD I just took

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,710
from WP engine WP engine has amazing

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,290
resources on that and they actually make

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,150
it really stupidly easy to see ICD

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,700
there's an application called deploy bot

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,680
there's one called code ship and I think

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,970
some of them even have like you eyes to

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,190
write tests where you don't even have to

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,570
like know how to write tests you just go

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,830
you can and they even have consultants

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,810
that will help you out

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,940
and that I put that article in there to

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,710
continue integration with WP engine and

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,710
deploy bot but the number one thing I

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,690
find and just in closing so many people

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,060
get like yeah we want to do see ICD and

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,920
react and modern development tools and

00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,910
you know all these buzzwords but what

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,310
does that really mean and what is the

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,500
benefit right and so what I hope to give

00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,910
you guys with this talk was don't I'm

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,470
working in Reverse I'm thinking about

00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,690
what are the standards that we want and

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,400
then this is actually the easy part if

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,050
you find a developer or you work with a

00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,910
partner like WP engine or you work with

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,130
a partner like insta they can help you

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,870
get this together but

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,580
you don't know why you're defining these

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,320
standards this is like the biggest waste

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,900
of time like I actually worked with a

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,540
team recently their version of CI CV was

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,270
like checking that all divs had classes

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,740
and I was like okay like why do we care

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,210
about that is that really gonna move the

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,000
needle and they're like we hate de vidas

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,650
and bootstrap like oh okay like but

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,240
that's not a business I don't care like

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,520
you know and that and people will just

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,750
write tests for the sake of tests but

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,930
think about what really moves the knee

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,000
on your organization and that's it I'm

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:31,670
gonna tweet the slides after this and

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,680
we're open for QA I left like 10 minutes

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,810
for questions guys so like please if I'm

00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,990
over if I overwhelmed you I'm sorry

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,990
about

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:59,410
I'm not oh cool yeah so I'm assuming

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:16,000
something like WP enforcer might enforce

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:18,520
WP standards yeah yeah and yeah perfect

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,440
yeah and so just so cuz I have to repeat

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,940
this because there's no microphone but

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,799
just so everyone knows they were he was

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,070
asking have heard of get enforcer which

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,900
I got our WP enforcer which was you know

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,169
mentioned by the guy I spoke before

00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:34,120
Chris wagon from WP engine there are

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:35,919
existing tools out there so if you don't

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,320
have like I don't know what standard to

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,090
use for yes lint air B&B as open source

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,669
there's they verb we use air B&B Zia

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,290
slant we didn't make our own PHP SCS

00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:47,580
standards we use WP we didn't make our

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,750
own we are making our own you know

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,520
standard JavaScript standards outside of

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,510
WordPress but there's a lot of this

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,309
stuff has been solved

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,740
so if you find someone or you know you

00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:58,419
know someone who you can start there and

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,000
that's what I meant by steal just go and

00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:02,380
borrow someone else's workflow and a lot

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,880
of you know a lot of developers are very

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,530
giving and you know they do write

00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,090
exactly how they did it or how you know

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,740
they implemented it the other thing I

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,049
recommend though to is to get out of the

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,299
WordPress space sometimes because one of

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:15,760
the things and I have this conversation

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,919
here this event was someone was that a

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,780
lot of the tutorials and stuff that are

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,500
being written are being written for

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:27,190
people who are using PHP 5.2 5.6 they're

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,510
not using PHP 7 right sometimes you have

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,700
to go out of the space and see what

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,900
people are doing in PHP and that really

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,360
makes the difference because even though

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,799
you know like what if you're moving if

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,380
you're doing these kind of standards and

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,790
see ICD and etc you have the benefit

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,410
that you can start to adapt really

00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,940
cutting-edge stuff because you're

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,860
actively testing and actively growing

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,900
and keeping up with the you know the

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,370
speed the development is moving but the

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,990
WordPress space because of backwards

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,790
compatibility you know they're they're

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,110
sticking with five two and five six but

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,030
if you can move ahead and get you know

00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,100
and let you guys know PHP seven is like

00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,170
100 times faster but literally I'm not

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,030
making that number up 100 times faster

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,770
so if you're in a host that's still in

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,470
five you're like you're burning money

00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,970
yeah and so that's why I do recommend

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,350
like you know try to look outside the

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,210
wrapper space or look work with hosts

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,010
that are you know just like wpengine

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,660
kennst us that are there pushing the

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:18,960
needle to get like to these higher

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,960
standards any other questions

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:33,060
so our wordpress systems wonder-percent

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:35,550
headless so the way that we're using the

00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:38,130
way that we use WordPress is that we

00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:40,860
still have the Gutenberg editor but what

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,320
we're doing is stuff

00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,990
so each Guttenberg block stores the data

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,450
in the database in a particular way and

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:52,110
then what we have is we have a build

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,760
tool that is going and grabbing all of

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,180
the like let's say we have a headline

00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,030
block it will take all of the blocks map

00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,340
them into a kind of JSON structure that

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,800
matches our JSON structure for our own

00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,630
proprietary system and then sends it all

00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,580
over to all of our different systems

00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,270
like for W Wall Street Journal we have a

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,000
mobile app we have you know Android iOS

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,350
we have desktop we also have Pro you

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,090
know because we have paid Wall Street

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,400
Journal and then also some of our data

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,840
if you you know when you guys go to new

00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,790
york city and see the tickers on all

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,830
like that buildings that's powered by

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,440
wordpress like all of our publishing is

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,650
being done by wordpress the new york

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,480
post's for example they are not

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,430
Gutenberg yet but they they use like

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,260
they give you notifications via SMS or

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,420
push notifications and that's headless

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,240
WordPress and so yeah we're one or two

00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,760
percent headless and and the benefit for

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,890
that is we I as a WordPress developer

00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,050
and building a CMS I'm no longer

00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,060
bothering with the front-end and we have

00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,530
a crazy front-end team that you know

00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,790
they handle that and they're dealing

00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,100
with the main membership teams the ad

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,570
tech teams and all those things I'm 100

00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,940
sent of focus on building a CMS that

00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,200
works for newsrooms and it's a really

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,420
great experience it's a very different

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,620
experience for they did before but yeah

00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,620
so that that's how we're using it

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,460
yeah I keep her gonna repeat the

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,679
questions yeah so the question was that

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,379
we are are we using how this wordpress

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,419
and yeah we are using headless WordPress

00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:24,210
with the WordPress REST API but in

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,740
what's happening is we're going to the

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,139
WordPress REST API grabbing that data

00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,299
and then an our plug-in we're modifying

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,750
it to match our JSON standards what we

00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:35,879
didn't want to do was modify our object

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,190
you know our data types for WordPress

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,500
instead we're modifying on the fly when

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,540
it gets published for our system because

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,369
you know we would have to modify then

00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,869
hundreds of thousands of websites we'd

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:52,339
rather just modify one WordPress to

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:52,339
match our standard any other questions

00:34:54,049 --> 00:35:00,390
so the craziest block that we both so

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,210
far is Dow Jones has a propriety as a

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,799
bunch of propriety api's but one of the

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,530
blocks that we're currently messing with

00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:09,780
is a chart block so we're allowing

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,369
people to grab real time data from

00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,589
different data sets that Dow Jones has

00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:16,010
and then manipulate that data into a

00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:18,359
chart to display and tell a story and

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:21,390
that is actually way more complex than

00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,700
it sounds because it's not really a data

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,069
problem the API is actually the easiest

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,589
part if and and not to like insult what

00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:29,880
I do but as a developer once you've like

00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:31,260
once you know how to pull from an API

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,430
you know how to cenek eight you know

00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,780
like what you know how many believe the

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,030
data put it where you want it that's the

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,650
easy part right and then now we solved

00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,299
the dependency issue so that's another

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,720
easy that's what we're making it easier

00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:45,930
now it's a user experience problem what

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,900
do we want to let people do right and so

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:51,359
one of the things without getting to

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,670
having to the chart API we recently

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,109
built a bio line block so if anyone's

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,700
not familiar like a byline is like by

00:35:55,109 --> 00:36:01,859
you know Victor Ramirez and let's say

00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:04,200
Brett right and so when every and we

00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,760
didn't build back in a uniform way what

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,589
happened was before I came on everyone

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,500
was already building it so one agency

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:11,970
built it we're in the guttenberg sidebar

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,930
they could search for names and then

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,910
drag the name into the byline okay then

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,890
one team went and built it where you

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,240
would type a name and then there'd be a

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,280
drop-down of all the available names

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,809
you'd select the name hit a plus to add

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,449
another name

00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:28,679
okay I thought that was weird and what

00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:31,189
they were doing was they were bringing

00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:33,209
in what I the way that I saw it was a CF

00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,829
into WordPress because that's this

00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:36,299
that's how WordPress forms work right

00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,589
that's what I think ninja forms is like

00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:39,239
that you drag things from the side

00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:40,799
gravity forms like that you drag things

00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:44,849
to the side right and that's how

00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:46,679
WordPress does things but in my mind I

00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:49,589
was like and this was this is what made

00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,809
it difficult by the way I said well how

00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:53,639
how does it work in the wild without us

00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,589
having to train users I didn't even get

00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:58,289
into that in here without having to

00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,489
train users our number what I started in

00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,349
when it comes to user interfaces and

00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:04,439
user experience our number one

00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:05,849
competitor is Domino's that sounds weird

00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:08,579
right and I literally say this to every

00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,919
stakeholder and here's why you guys know

00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:13,019
this as web developers non-technical

00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:15,299
stakeholders have no concept of what the

00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:18,179
cost or scope is of a technical problem

00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:20,189
right so when I order I have an ordered

00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,719
Domino's in a while but like when you if

00:37:20,189 --> 00:37:23,369
anyone hasn't I try to try it just order

00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,789
Domino's for the kids see this is pretty

00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:25,469
cool

00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:27,809
you ordered Domino's on the website and

00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:29,429
there's a Domino's tracker you literally

00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,739
can see when the pizza goes in the oven

00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:33,479
when the dude has it in the car and you

00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,829
can cheer him on and like even tip him

00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:37,679
extra money if he gets in the car

00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:41,219
earlier right that's my user experience

00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,789
for a 10 dollar pizza right so why in

00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:47,489
god's name for a 100 dollar form block

00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:49,649
or a 500 or this block or a 50,000

00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:52,349
dollar enterprise plugin do I have this

00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:53,699
horrible user interface right so that's

00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:55,589
why I say Domino's is our competitor

00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:59,069
because people a $10 pizza has an

00:37:55,589 --> 00:38:00,389
amazing user experience right so what I

00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,829
did was when and looked in the wild and

00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,899
said what is the user experience when

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:07,949
you're adding names to something

00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:10,349
Facebook app Twitter app you know and

00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:15,179
all those other things so in the

00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:17,130
guttenberg the guttenberg package on the

00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:19,439
github repo it's not well-documented

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,899
there is an autocomplete ER right and

00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:24,059
the default autocomplete er in WordPress

00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:26,309
in Gutenberg if you guys want to go burg

00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,589
right now and do the app it goes and

00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:31,079
searches the profiles from your

00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:32,789
WordPress site right but we didn't need

00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,189
that we want to pull from external

00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:36,809
authors right because one person might

00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,560
be writing the story but there might be

00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,470
five

00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,230
editor's on a story right and so what we

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,550
did was we with Gutenberg you can and I

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,490
to learn this on the fly by the way it's

00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,590
not documented but we disabled the

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,510
standard at right and with the

00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,270
autoprefixer package that is available

00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,910
in Gutenberg you can make any auto

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,650
computer you want so what we did was we

00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,020
made an auto complete er block for the

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,210
byline that when you hit at instead of

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,790
pinging the internal rest API and that's

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,400
how they get the UM the authors we

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:11,100
pinged an external API just via fetch

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,620
which is a standard es6 very simple just

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,880
fetched to our external API and as the

00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,490
person types it goes and searches all

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,900
the names and then they when they find

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,670
the name they want they hit enter and

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,710
the name populates and it goes to next

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,180
space they want and an even better in

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,980
Gutenberg because we didn't expect

00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,600
people to know to do at when they

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,450
dropped that block you can do there's

00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,620
packages to build tooltips so have you

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,300
guys ever like hovered over something in

00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,040
facebook and it says like hey do this if

00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,140
you're trying to do that you go that's

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,210
available in Guttenberg it's not

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,350
documented again but like we so we went

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,880
it's documented okay but they don't

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,380
really tell you by the way you've seen

00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,450
this in asana and Facebook so you may

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,830
want to use it so now that's one of our

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,110
requirements on every single block

00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,220
requires a tooltip if someone hovers for

00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,520
more than five seconds or something

00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,710
right

00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,750
and so that tooltip then says press at

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,150
to start searching authors right and

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,730
then the other thing we did was now that

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,290
by laying block we also restricted that

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,270
that autocomplete er only works in the

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,340
byline block if you try to instantiate

00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,560
or press the at symbol in any other

00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,240
block it doesn't work and that block is

00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,430
restricted to only be used once if you

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,720
try to use that block again it's not

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,630
available it's not available in the

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,310
drop-down list and that was like now

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,290
that I went through a lot right that's a

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,600
lot of stuff to do but think about that

00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,760
I essentially made my own like asana

00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,260
experience and it was so and we had a

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,090
hackathon recently where all the teams

00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,500
got together and when we demoed our

00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,090
byline everyone's like well we're

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,280
stealing that like I was like yep please

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,170
do and and now instead of thinking about

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,790
each of us making our own block now the

00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,040
next problem is how do we add a filter

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,690
so people could add different api's how

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,190
do we you know modify and how do we and

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,780
by having standardization robogirl like

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,850
that and that was a similar thing with

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,680
the chart block because now back to the

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,200
user experience problem do we have a

00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,400
drop-down do we have autocomplete er

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,330
that's not really I think appropriate

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,960
for a chart

00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,670
do we what users are have what API is

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,280
available to them if they're a

00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,250
bankruptcy desk writer what API is do

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,320
they need if they're a mergers and

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,480
acquisitions writer what do they need if

00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,650
they're just a contractor and we don't

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,480
want them to have access to really

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,830
sensitive data what does that mean and

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,750
that's that's a really complex problem

00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,760
because it's who's using it who's

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,290
writing it who's authorized how does it

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,820
look and those are really interesting

00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,350
problems you can solve now that you have

00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,120
Guttenberg because I wouldn't even know

00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:25,680
how to begin to do that in an in an

00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:58,590
inform interface interface and too many

00:41:25,680 --> 00:42:00,840
options right yeah for charts okay yep

00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,990
yep okay so let me so just to repeat the

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:06,000
question I was just asked what do you do

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:08,750
if the API is no longer available or the

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,150
API changes or things like that right

00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,610
right for existing cause without but

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,460
with piercing with Guttenberg right okay

00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:19,230
right right

00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,120
so some API we have no control over and

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,310
some API is if we tried to do this we'd

00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,320
violate their standards so for example

00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,020
the Instagram block right there's

00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,340
certain blocks where we essentially say

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,410
and sometimes agencies are like oh we

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,820
don't really like the block from the

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,110
default standard WordPress we're gonna

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,120
build our own and I said hold on a

00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,920
second who's gonna build it who's gonna

00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,360
maintain it what are the standards so

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,210
for example the Instagram block right

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,590
the beauty of the Instagram block is

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:45,390
don't try to build a custom just use the

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,950
standard Instagram block it's pretty

00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,120
good like I don't care what there can't

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,920
be a feature that you want to have to

00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,170
maintain that because the Instagram API

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,730
is changing so often right but let's

00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,040
look at the chart API we thought about

00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,840
that we said hey we want the chart data

00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,360
live in the editor but what's great

00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,790
about Guttenberg is there's two

00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,950
functions there's an edit function which

00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,720
dictates how it works in

00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,359
the editor then there's the save

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,150
function which dictates how it looks the

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,329
viewer and in your database right we

00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,270
flatten the chart we capture it as an

00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:20,910
image and then we save that to the

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:23,609
database and that image is then forever

00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,990
in perpetuity available and that that's

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,790
really cool because that was immediately

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,230
we had that same that was the exact same

00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,339
issue of to think about what if all of

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,230
our API has changed where our keys

00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:33,089
change or the site goes down we want

00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,400
these you know this and also the one

00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,890
thing we're actually gonna limit the

00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,349
amount of stories in our WordPress

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,210
instance to keep it fast so there will

00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:44,250
only be like 100 to 500 stories at a

00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,780
time once the story has been in there

00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,849
for like six months it will get dumped

00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,040
and put into a into our custom API

00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:51,810
storage space because we want the site

00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,400
to be fast we don't want 5,000 posts and

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:56,250
if someone wants to edit an old post

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,869
they have to go into the our system grab

00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,869
a key and they can input it and

00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:02,250
reinstate the story so those are like

00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,390
really and that's interesting problems

00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,880
to solve because you have to think about

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,710
that right when API is disappear one

00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,660
thing change and that's I think one of

00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,339
the scary things about Guttenberg it's

00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,349
gonna force you and this is the one

00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:15,359
thing I say we just brought on some new

00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,069
developers I tell them like you can't

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,740
use Stack Overflow you can't use Google

00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:21,180
you can't use anything like you have to

00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,420
literally go into the Gutenberg github

00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,440
repo or go fork Richard Tambor stuff by

00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,540
the way if you want to fork anything

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,920
look at Richard Tambor's code blocks I

00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,619
still have his stuff I bought him to

00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,480
drink so I feel were even but um you

00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:38,160
know or cocoa blocks look at atomic

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,599
blocks look at stackable we go and look

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,040
at those and we and that and that's

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,240
kinda like we borrow from but it's a

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,589
really interesting challenge and that

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,119
kind of stuff if you think about it what

00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:46,319
do you do in the API disappears that's

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,670
stuff that we don't have to worry about

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,900
right now in WordPress really right

00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,609
because we're not doing the react thing

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,810
if it disappears we can like do an

00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:54,180
interesting image but that's not

00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,140
predefined for us right so yeah so

00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,839
that's what we're doing to solve that

00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,790
how am i doing on time

00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:02,150
has he gonna question I think where

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,150
anyone ever

00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,180
the question was what am i doing for

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,440
state management so we're just using the

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,670
standard Redux wrapper what's in there

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,990
yeah so we don't know so anything so

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,210
we're trying to really just stick to the

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,309
word per my goal is to stick to vanilla

00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,829
WordPress so we're trying to be as

00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:23,690
vanilla as possible anything where we

00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:24,980
have to like pull in like you know

00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,630
someone was like oh I really don't like

00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,890
this about the Guttenberg thing or I

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,660
don't like this or this could be better

00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,329
or isn't there a better this we could do

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,319
and it's only I've never seen something

00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,940
that's 10 times better

00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,770
it's always something that's like 10

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,020
percent better and maybe saves one of

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,059
our developers 15 minutes but the one

00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,069
thing is as a and that's like you know

00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:44,450
and I apologize anyone who uses this but

00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:45,230
like twig press or not the duck quick

00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,059
press what is it called

00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,069
timber quick press is someone's Twitter

00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:52,640
handle timber right or like timber and

00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:53,780
like all these like or like Brett help

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,180
me out what is that thing call what are

00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,280
these these custom theme frameworks that

00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,760
kind of like reconfigure WordPress to be

00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,200
in different folders there's there's all

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,290
these like you know frameworks out there

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,730
with a reconfigure WordPress right and a

00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,470
lot of people say you know you'll see on

00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:12,049
advanced WordPress people will say oh

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,549
well like any developer is gonna be able

00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:15,799
to figure that out in 10 hours anyway

00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:20,210
right okay cool I have 100 developers

00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:22,790
and now I have to spend 100 or 1000

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,559
hours for them to get up to speed now

00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:26,119
for my team that makes an unhappy

00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,290
developer they're on salary anyway

00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,200
doesn't cost me more money but it's a

00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:31,880
waste of time for vendors I now have to

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,980
pay that vendor money and there's a

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,079
diminishing ROI unless we're using that

00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,119
across all our systems right and then I

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,710
can't go and recruit in a standard

00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,390
WordPress community I have to find

00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,819
someone who knows this really abstract

00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,839
concept right and so that - when any

00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:47,510
earth when you start thinking about

00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,890
anything like because I know tribe event

00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,680
the guys who have event the event plus

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,660
modern tribe they made their own wrapper

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,099
for Redux right and that was the big

00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,780
conversation advanced WordPress where

00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:58,670
Yost and everyone else said now you're

00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,809
gonna have to maintain that right and I

00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,579
guess if they're doing enough business

00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:04,069
to maintain their own redux wrapper

00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:05,630
their own redux great I don't want to

00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:06,950
maintain that your enemy I don't want to

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,750
deal with that and it's like about what

00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,640
you know what what's going to move the

00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,079
needle right now for example with that

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,880
chart system if we had to comment with

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,049
our own state management that would make

00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,099
sense because dow-jones

00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:18,170
our money is date

00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,579
we trade information right that's

00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,799
something where I'd make our own state

00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,209
management system right but you have to

00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:24,559
think about what's good if it's if it's

00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:26,839
not going to give you ten times the ROI

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,190
if it's like a ten percent bump don't

00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:31,339
you don't even do it stick to vanilla

00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,779
WordPress I'm very opinionated by the

00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:34,549
way so if like anyone doesn't like what

00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:46,609
I say it's fine I'm sorry

00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:49,160
cool any other questions so again we're

00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:50,420
headless so I'm not at work excited

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,209
about widgets because it doesn't really

00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,930
affect us but in my personal life you

00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:58,519
know and like and I am excited about I

00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,499
think it's really exciting because the

00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,239
opportunities that are there if anyone

00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,859
is played with like web flow or plate

00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,079
and outside of page builders right

00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:08,029
there's all these great web experiences

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,589
like someone has made doom in JavaScript

00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:11,749
right like there's a JavaScript doom and

00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:13,910
I think it's like one megabyte right I

00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:15,979
heard this because YouTube was a two

00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,119
megabyte page and then this I think the

00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:19,670
guy who was in charge of the YouTube

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,349
team said Doom is one megabyte why is

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,390
you to our YouTube pages two megabytes

00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,829
right and not even the video and that

00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,049
makes sense right so it's a challenge

00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:29,599
and I'm excited about the challenge of

00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:31,369
going and looking at how composition

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,900
will work right because you could use

00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:35,420
Gutenberg and I don't know if this is a

00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,039
use case they're gonna validate but you

00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,359
could use Gutenberg to compose news

00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,640
letters right I mean Gutenberg looks

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:44,839
just like MailChimp right you could use

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,920
Gutenberg to go and create you know this

00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,269
is something you know that you might you

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,859
could do it for print stuff you could do

00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:51,499
it if the limit is like you as a

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:53,749
developer right and with JavaScript you

00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:56,269
know we didn't create a custom chart API

00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:59,630
we just use there's a react chart API

00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:01,249
available there's a react game API

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,869
there's every as someone's creating

00:49:01,249 --> 00:49:04,699
something for react right tensorflow

00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,920
there's a javascript open source

00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:08,779
JavaScript machine learning algorithm

00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,670
there right so so I guess so yeah with

00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:13,549
that in mind my number we thing is like

00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,949
personalization so I really want it

00:49:13,549 --> 00:49:18,559
where like what I love is when I go to a

00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:20,150
website within reason I don't want

00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,039
creepy like hey we know everything about

00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,299
you and buy five of these because you

00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:25,190
know you're a fatty and eat this so

00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:28,099
we're not really like fine but like I

00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:29,990
want essentially like you know I don't

00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,670
like ID like today

00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,010
Delta said it's time to check in I

00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:36,860
clicked the link in the email and it

00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:38,750
tried to open the app I hit cancel and

00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:41,180
then I got a blank page went back to the

00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,520
email clicked it and tried to open the

00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,290
app and cancel I had to go to Delta find

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,910
my number put it in right and that's

00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,900
like Delta they haven't even solved

00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:51,140
these problems right there like a

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,060
fortune 100 fortune 500 company but what

00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,370
that means is now we as WordPress people

00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,380
we can solve that problem I could write

00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:00,050
a simple cookie or if statement or

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,820
something to go and see if someone has

00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,470
cancelled downloading the app before or

00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,940
if they don't get redirect to the app to

00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,890
serve different content right

00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,050
and so with Gutenberg there's this new

00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:11,810
level of personalization so if I

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,610
remember before I was saying we restrict

00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,860
the autocomplete err to a certain block

00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,960
right I could restrict that autocomplete

00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,120
err to a certain user I could restrict

00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,370
blocks to certain users I can restrict

00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,170
blocks to certain IPS

00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,900
I can BLET you know restrict to certain

00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,380
regions to certain languages and so

00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,550
there's all this like really amazing

00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,520
customization for you know for really

00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,590
rich experiences and also once the

00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,210
accessibility issue is solved and that's

00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,130
again that's like the editor experience

00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,600
accessibility issue you could go and

00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,700
detect and like you know I told you in

00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,010
the save component you can go and save

00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,990
the data however you want right so if

00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:50,030
you save the data in a proper way you

00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,130
could use it for tickers in the news I

00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,590
could use it to send you know data to

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,630
you know my Twitter feed or any of those

00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,710
things so that's really I'm excited

00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,480
about just being able to push and pull

00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,100
data wherever I want in the world so not

00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,750
really I guess like the widgets and

00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,380
stuff that's nice but wouldn't it be

00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:08,390
nice that if I was like a store owner

00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,880
someone made a widget that just went to

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:13,010
Google my business grabbed the current

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,070
hours and if I put were closed for

00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:17,990
Easter the block updates and that person

00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,030
doesn't have to go into WordPress right

00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,740
because this is like WordPress it can be

00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,120
complicated but I just think anything

00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,040
for another person to log into is not

00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,780
exciting right wouldn't it be great if

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,250
we had a block that you know and and

00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,990
that's all I love about like Genesis

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,480
they already have like you literally put

00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,680
in the the the time they have like a

00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,390
time shortcode on your footer

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,310
automatically updates your site never

00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,860
says copyright 2015 four years later

00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,240
right and so little things like that

00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,569
really contextual data that's I'm

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,250
excited about the same thing for like

00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:47,569
okay really sorry there is some really

00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,210
exciting stuff we're doing at News Corp

00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:51,559
that I can't really talk about but um

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,819
but for an example right like think

00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:55,130
about this I was talking before about

00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:56,599
blogging right so one of the things if

00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,420
you guys noticed you going to Yoast and

00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:01,609
you can set it up where it will check on

00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,970
I think on save it goes in checks like

00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:06,829
why your SEO is doing right but imagine

00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:09,200
that you wanted to have that like where

00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:10,940
if anyone uses a word that's not allowed

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,099
in your style guide we don't allow that

00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,720
word right so immediately as someone's

00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:16,369
typing if they type that word you can

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,200
capture it in real time via hooks

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:20,359
there's a hooks thing in uh in Gutenberg

00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,500
WP hooks you can grab it and say don't

00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,819
use that word and have like a big alert

00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,559
that says like whatever or you could be

00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:26,030
even a goofball about it and have like I

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,369
don't know what is that in Jurassic Park

00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,809
Newman he's like uh uh didn't say the

00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:31,400
magic word right you could have

00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,930
something like you could you can make

00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,730
your experience whatever you want it to

00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,980
be so it's I think the exciting thing

00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,859
not just Gutenberg because Gutenberg

00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,900
really is just react the potential is

00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:44,510
limitless because what we're back to the

00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,579
standardization thing we're now we're

00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,690
catching up JavaScript's eating the

00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,700
world like that's actually where a lot

00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,890
of people are saying we're now joining

00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,299
everyone else everyone's using one

00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,859
common language that's why I tensorflow

00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:57,260
was originally written in Python

00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:59,210
now they wrote in JavaScript I think I

00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,040
just saw someone released like another

00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,930
AI thing it was written in you know

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,030
Python and now they're made a javascript

00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,559
wrapper because they realize if you go

00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,270
to any high school code camp if you go

00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,619
to most colleges now - they're all

00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,329
moving towards JavaScript so that's

00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:14,809
standardization I just think it

00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:24,740
potential is limitless so I don't have a

00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:27,410
answered your question all right so

00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,819
that's not our team that's the doubt so

00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,380
we call that downstream like the people

00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:33,380
are doing the websites they're doing ham

00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,049
stories but back - so the question was

00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:38,059
are we looking at amp stories if

00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:39,470
everyone's not familiar like in

00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,730
Instagram there's stories where you

00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,710
click the story and it goes through

00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,079
Google is now launching its own version

00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,940
of stories so when you go and click a

00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,809
link in Google it will be a swipeable

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,490
story and so I think that's kind of

00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,960
nightmarish because I am in my browser

00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:57,290
and now I click a link and I have a

00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,970
story but there is a people it's

00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,640
shows high engagement for both Instagram

00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:04,040
and Facebook so with Guttenberg you can

00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,750
go and build your own amp stories

00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,190
builder but it would have to be set you

00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,560
know you have to now that's a user

00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:11,840
experience problem right because there's

00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,090
a startup that I work with outside of

00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,040
Dow Jones called whippets and what they

00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,650
do is you give them a you give them an

00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,780
article and they go and find using

00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:22,730
machine learning and AI the most

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,950
important phrases in that article and

00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,440
then they turn that they match it with

00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:30,050
stock video footage or like getty

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,310
footage and turn that into a video so if

00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:34,040
you guys ever seen bloomberg any

00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,870
bloomberg video that has text overlays

00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,750
on stock footage and news footage that's

00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:41,480
generated by a bot called with its and

00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:43,160
all the editor does is they go in and

00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,600
say that phrase makes no sense give me

00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,580
another one the BOK gives another one

00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,940
that video makes no sense give this one

00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,140
instead and it's doing that right so it

00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,760
would be great if we could do something

00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,470
like that where we read the blog post

00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,300
and go based on this blog that you gave

00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:58,430
us here's your amp story with five

00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,440
images and five phrases that were the

00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,880
most important quotes right but that's

00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,260
something you could do now because now

00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,270
we can bring in tensorflow for our

00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,040
machine learning we could bring in react

00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,290
to do kind of like you know the modal

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,210
experience of editing the story before

00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,530
they go to publish and so that's the

00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,120
kind of stuff you can do now with

00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,170
Guttenberg and that's the people really

00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,340
aren't doing because they're not

00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,600
thinking like that whereas like yeah

00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:34,010
thinking how do we bring an amp story

00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:35,810
into Guttenberg yeah interesting but I

00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,430
think but I think the thing to is how do

00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:39,680
you get people to do it right because

00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,940
the thing is like everyone guys like how

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,620
many times you read a blog post there's

00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,510
no featured image there's no SEO keyword

00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,510
that you got it you you have to make the

00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:49,250
user experience easy people to do it

00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,530
like and that's the same thing we even

00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,540
with Guttenberg now we have it we're

00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,570
like if you put a blockquote and don't

00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,040
put an attribution you can't publish

00:55:55,570 --> 00:56:00,200
every block quote must have an

00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,580
attribution if an image doesn't have a

00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,620
caption with an attribution you cannot

00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,270
publish and so those are the kind of

00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,790
things you can do in Guttenberg you

00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,380
couldn't do in the standard tiny MCE

00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,100
editor for each of those individual

00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,450
components

00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,780
so cool I think it's time right all

00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:19,850
right cool

00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,900
all right thank you so much guys I hope

00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,990
you enjoyed it I'm going to post the

00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,990
