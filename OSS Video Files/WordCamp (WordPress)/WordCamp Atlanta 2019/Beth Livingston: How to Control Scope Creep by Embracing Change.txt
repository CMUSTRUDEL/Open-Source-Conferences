Title: Beth Livingston: How to Control Scope Creep by Embracing Change
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	It is well known in the software and website development world that scope creep is the primary cause of projects running over time and budget. At the very least, uncontrolled scope creep will impact your project profit margin as you try and accommodate both legitimate and impractical client requests for change.
In this presentation, we will discuss how to minimize scope creep by acknowledging and planning for change instead of penalizing the client for it. We will cover the elements of a good change control plan and how acknowledging change up front can actually set you ahead of your competition and get you more clients.
Attendees will learn how to craft a good change control plan, how to educate the client regarding change, and how to use the change control plan as a selling feature. Attendees will leave with a sample written change control plan they can take and modify to meet their specific needs.

	00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,700
today I'm going to talk to you about how

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,220
to prevent scope creep by embracing

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,290
change there's everybody familiar with

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,580
what a whop who is is anyone not

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,020
familiar with what a whop who is okay

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,220
whop who is this little creature

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,789
this particular wobbu is a villain whop

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,470
ooh

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,330
I didn't know there were villain

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,920
whoppers but if you want to see all the

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,910
whop news that they've ever done go to

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,360
wopo dot wobbu dot us that's the fellow

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,050
that's upstairs what's his name John

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,930
James yes and I have many pens but

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,190
anyway this is the villain scope creep

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,980
whap ooh because we all know scope creep

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,980
is our enemy all right so a little bit

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,530
about me I have to look at my notes let

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,800
me tell you this here's here's the thing

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,539
I do that picture obviously doesn't look

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,829
like me because that was 10 years ago I

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,650
did a little theater work and that was

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,369
my professional headshot but I think I

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,220
look good so I leave it up but when you

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,260
get up as an actress and you pretend to

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,909
be another character there's like no

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,560
nervousness because you're pretending to

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,530
be somebody else but when you're up here

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,750
as yourself and talking to your peers

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,759
it makes one a little nervous so I

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,200
wanted to make sure that I got the right

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,930
stuff that's why I said I needed to

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,009
check my notes ok so I first got into

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:37,140
WordPress I had to spent 25 years in IT

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,420
consulting as a business analyst and I

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,340
left that job in 2016 I left the

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,280
corporate world in 2016 but earlier this

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,720
exactly earlier than that I got involved

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,170
with WordPress because I was trying to

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,540
build a web app remember when the coop

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,340
hunting thing was so big and 2008 2009

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,719
10 everybody was trying to save money

00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,490
save money save money well I'm not a

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,930
couponer so I wanted to create a web app

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,390
that would just tell me where my crap

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,640
was on sale right the stuff that I

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,979
always buy so I started creating this

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,629
web app had a dotnet programmer helping

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,550
me as a friend of mine well he got a

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,290
girlfriend so he was never available

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,939
anymore and I said

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,590
please please Chris there's got to be a

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,269
better way there's I'm a technical

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,299
person I know you can give me something

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,180
to let me do this myself and he said he

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:28,319
sent me Joomla anybody familiar with

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,879
Joomla as the craziest I had some and I

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,230
just threw up my hands and said it's in

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,340
it I know there's got to be a better

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,459
solution and that's when I found

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,709
WordPress that that web app was called

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,599
max my shopping my websites still up I

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,790
have intentions of going back to it with

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,799
a different intent but there's really

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,420
nothing of value on it at this point but

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,269
it did win third place that the first

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,569
time triad startup weekend was held in

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,629
the Triad area of North Carolina you can

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:59,340
find me just about everywhere at WP read

00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:01,739
maps comm and now I help

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,889
WordPress practitioners and I call them

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,689
practitioners because developer designer

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,239
implementer integrator whatever piece

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,000
you're doing if you're also managing

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,879
projects then you're my audience because

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,549
I'm helping WordPress practitioners

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,970
manage learn more about project

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,989
management and productivity management

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,209
okay so what are you going to learn

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,290
today and I'm sorry you know that

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,000
nervous think makes my mouth real dry

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,739
okay so I'm going to tell you what

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,479
you're going to learn today what is

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:40,650
scope creep if they may not know what

00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:42,750
scope creep is okay huh your life how

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,620
the projects have projects do creep

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,030
proof that it works that this what I'm

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,599
getting ready to share with you works

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,599
how to embrace change elements of a good

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,560
change control process and the magic of

00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,199
the change budget okay so what is scope

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,269
creep pure and simple it's when your

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,099
WordPress project goes into areas that

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,470
you had not planned for that to happen

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,290
that you didn't previously agree on with

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,069
the client I mean how does a wordpress

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,320
project creep usually lack of clarity

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,269
not enough definition of the

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,609
requirements and the specifications for

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,590
the website beginning design and

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,650
development way too early before you

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,430
have all those details over-promising

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,919
with an unreal

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,639
ballistic completion date and I know

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,050
we've all done this just to get the job

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,220
gold plating disguised as over

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,900
delivering and I'm going to tell you a

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,850
little bit more about what gold plating

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,550
is in just a minute but these are the

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,340
typical ways that a wordpress project

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,400
will creep here's an example of how

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,860
clients create scope creep is it too

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,350
late to add four more floors is it too

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,680
late to add 12 more pages is it too late

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,470
to add a store I've had these things

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,810
happen at the very end of a project so

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,090
this is one way that clients create

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,759
scope creep

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,009
another way is I'm sure I told you about

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,870
that and I thought it was included in

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,550
your quote since you didn't make it

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,530
clear it wasn't included you need to

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,410
include it anyway have you ever heard

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,479
this I've heard it that's one way that

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,979
it happens and then you then you go the

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,330
extra mile because you just thought you

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,370
just want to keep the job you don't want

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,199
to lose a job I know we were late in

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,320
providing this content to you but you

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,099
can still get it done by X date right

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,289
there's another thing another

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:35,419
unrealistic expectation and how clients

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,419
create scope creep oops sorry

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,650
your primary subject matter expert had

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,810
to leave but i'ma let his secretary help

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,729
you now well if that secretary doesn't

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,860
have the same skill set that your

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,260
subject matter expert had you're in

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,870
trouble so that is also a way that

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,729
projects can that scope can creep

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,440
because scope creep we always think of

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,780
scope creep as just requirements but

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,669
it's not if your resources change and

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,990
your plans were you had the senior

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,150
programmer and now you got to use a

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,740
junior programmer that's still scope

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,560
creep because it's outside of what you

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,570
originally planned

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,909
okay common ways you can create scope

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,370
creep in your own project and most often

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,169
this is gold plating and that's throwing

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,729
something in because you think it's cool

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,110
you think the client will like it they

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,909
didn't ask for it it's not a business

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
requirement you just think it's cool so

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,930
you throw it in it's a waste of money

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,099
and a waste of time I had some I forget

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,590
who I was talking to you this weekend

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,150
went into a big long story about that

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,550
about how they threw all this stuff in

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,110
and nobody ever used it it was somebody

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,070
big like Go Daddy I can't remember who

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,260
it was but they put all this

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,000
functionality in and then nobody

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:48,480
we used it because they didn't ask the

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,070
customer on the front end okay here's

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,570
another way we do it oh that's just a

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,320
small change I'll just do it only take

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,300
me five minutes

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,350
and then the next was five minutes when

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,640
the next one's five minutes and then

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,920
when the client has something they're

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,420
going to want you to do it for free

00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,190
again hell you through that other thing

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:07,590
in right so just do it

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:09,930
oh the change control process takes too

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,140
long we'll just do this so we can meet

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,820
the project plan another mistake because

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,190
if you have a change and here's the

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,870
biggest problem is that most people have

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,090
a change control process in their

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,610
business they don't stick to it and that

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,830
it has to be without exception no matter

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,840
how small the change is because that's

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,250
what sets the proper expectation for the

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,420
client we'll just go ahead and start

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,640
even though we don't have all the

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,960
details or all the content yet and then

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,970
we'll just put that all that rest of

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,820
that stuff in later that almost always

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,950
causes rework it might not be something

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,310
that you can build the client for so you

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,130
now have eaten into your ROI when it

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,230
wasn't necessary if you just get your

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,940
content and get your requirements done

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,560
before you start designing and

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,270
developing there are some people who

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,790
disagree with that I am a total believer

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,670
in content first it works for me I don't

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,430
do one stitch of development until I

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,870
have all the content now by that I don't

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,690
mean that I don't go set up some plugins

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,200
and I set up the environment but in

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,080
terms of actually building anything

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:22,440
because what you tends to happen is

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:26,010
especially with content excuse me what

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,280
tends to happen is you've built the

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,290
website you're already all you're doing

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,270
is waiting on that content the content

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,220
never comes and the content never comes

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,260
so you say oh I'll just go ahead and

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,270
finish it and then when the content is

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,830
ready I'll just plop it in and then when

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,590
the content comes it's not what you

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,820
expected the client has changes when

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,140
they're when they're pulling the client

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
when the client is responsible for

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,390
pulling the content together that

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,860
activity itself spurs ideas in their

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,529
head

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,100
and it spurs things they forgot to tell

00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:01,339
you in the in the initial query session

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,490
right so that's why it's so important to

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,700
get that content lined up and while it's

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,190
going to go off on a tangent but I won't

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,680
okay proof that this way of managing

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,810
change works once upon a time I worked

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,690
for a company called Keene based in

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,850
Boston and they're now NTT DATA

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,860
they ate somebody somebody ate them they

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,519
ate somebody else and so now they're NTT

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,990
DATA and John King wrote a book called

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,910
the six principles of productivity

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,310
management for software development and

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,110
those six principles changed my life

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,360
they changed my personal life they

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,610
changed my work life and this was like a

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,290
cult you had to have the copy of this

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,300
book you had to go to a two-day seminar

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,519
and even senior executives if they

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,250
didn't go got fired for not going and

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,930
why because this worked what he did was

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,810
he was an old IBM er and he started a

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,490
consulting firm being the 80s and his

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,890
projects were all running over time and

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,040
budget so he did what any good IBM who

00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,199
does he hired a consultant to come in

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,870
and study his projects and they

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:05,180
identified six areas where things were

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,980
going awry and so he developed these six

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,110
principles they're very simple

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,550
common-sense principles and I have a

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,529
little training free training on my

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,519
website about the principles and I'll

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,070
tell you a little bit more about that in

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,680
a minute but it was define that you can

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,920
see him on the front of the book there

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,110
define the job in detail get the get the

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,660
right people involved estimate the time

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,940
and cost break the job down establish a

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:33,620
change process and agree on acceptance

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,420
criteria and the break the job down one

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,160
that was an eight he called it the

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,360
eighty hour rule we had to have a

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,550
deliverable now these some of these

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,110
projects were two years long okay but we

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,690
had to have a deliverable every eighty

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,850
hours not necessarily a deliverable that

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,010
goes to the client but a deliverable

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,620
that that way you know within two weeks

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,329
time and of course if your whole

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,339
projects only four weeks you would break

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,040
it down into smaller chunks but that way

00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,839
you have an incremental process for

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,040
determining am I on schedule my behind

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,770
schedule that sort of thing so after

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,720
that he started implementing this

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,310
they were consistently in the Gartner

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Magic Quadrant and if anybody doesn't

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,410
know what that is just google it in the

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,650
Magic Quadrant for getting projects done

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,120
on time and within budget it's really it

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,070
was really very sad to me when they were

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,500
acquired by another company because that

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,810
whole methodology that whole book that

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,000
whole it was really more of a culture at

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,300
that place went away and it was actually

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,090
kind of sad ok so how do you embrace

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,760
change the first thing you have to do is

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,800
educate the client you know we when we

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,190
go we talk to clients we try to act like

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,630
we know everything and and but we forget

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,180
what they don't know they don't know how

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,740
our business works being honest with the

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,120
client and tell them look there's going

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,160
to be change later because you're gonna

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,960
forget things I'm gonna forget things

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,610
they're gonna be things we think of

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,400
later that would be a better way of

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,490
doing things so educate your client on

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,230
what on the bottlenecks and the problems

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,840
that that projects often face

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,490
acknowledge change as inevitable it is

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,650
we tend to take this attitude that if I

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,690
don't get it all right at the beginning

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:20,180
then it's got to be a change for later

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,860
and we tend to pretend like if yours if

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,870
you're really good then there will be no

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,670
change in your project that's crazy

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,720
because you there's always going to be

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:32,390
changed this is my big one abandoned the

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,550
crystal ball approach let's see I think

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,980
that'll take me about 10 hours and

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,440
that's your you know and this this task

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,690
will take me about two hours you need to

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,730
have a repeatable process for estimating

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,740
your projects and you need and because

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,570
if you don't measure how do you know

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,700
you're getting any better at it and the

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,950
only way to get better at it is to

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,680
continue to do it unfortunately I wish

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,360
there was a special formula that we

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,130
could just plug in for everybody and it

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,500
would give you the proper estimate but

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,120
just practicing is that is the best

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,400
thing in terms of estimate but this

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,800
crystal ball approach we we tend to want

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,020
our clients to think that we are you

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,880
know omniscient and we can see into the

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,340
future and we've done this so many times

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,020
and we're so professional we know this

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,310
is how it this is the best solution for

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,529
you and you really have to do more than

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,350
yes

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,990
position changes opportunity when a

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,119
client says oh you know I just looked at

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,459
my competitors site and they have this

00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:34,579
really cool feature and I want that

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,350
feature on my website that might be a

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,240
good time to say you know what let's

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,550
make that a phase-two item let's get all

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,709
the stuff we'd already agreed upon done

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,929
and then we'll go to phase 2 so you can

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:47,749
always position it as opportunity this

00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:51,100
is my big one establish and stick to the

00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:53,629
change control process without exception

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,759
I'm going to go into these a little bit

00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,699
more in detail in just a minute put the

00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,889
client in charge of change you put the

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,509
client in charge of change where they

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,619
manage it all and I'll explain a little

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,160
bit more in detail about that in a

00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:08,480
second

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,939
they tend to ask for fewer frivolous

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,160
changes like can we make that red color

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:14,089
a little darker you know they can kill

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,749
you with all those little nitpicky

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:20,540
things okay so how do you educate the

00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:22,249
client first of all it's not their fault

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,019
they don't know they are in a completely

00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:25,339
different business and my brother is a

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,959
realtor and I helped him with his

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,799
website and he had said to me on more

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,079
than one occasion

00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,639
well I just want to sell houses I don't

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,069
want to learn all this stuff about my

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,499
about my computer so it's not their

00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:37,970
fault they don't know we forget what we

00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:41,089
didn't used to know sometimes don't you

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,189
think you need to discuss the way you're

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,230
going to manage change very early in the

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,240
process let them know this is how we do

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,790
it and we do it this way every single

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,399
time whether there's a change to the to

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,279
the requirements a change to the cost or

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,019
change to the resources you need to be

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,519
brutally honest about change I already

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,249
covered that just tell them exactly how

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,139
this typically goes in a project but you

00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:05,360
have a process in place to keep these

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,329
things from happening so that way it

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,100
also becomes a selling point or a unique

00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:13,579
value proposition because now you're a

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,529
good project manager suggest other

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,689
options for content activities this is a

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,699
big one home I don't know why clients

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:21,529
think they can write content just out of

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:24,379
the blue like it's so easy or gather

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,649
their photographs or any of that so what

00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,290
I do is

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,779
I run a random sorry rough order of

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,660
magnitude estimate for the content then

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,699
I show it to and usually they'll look at

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,410
that and go whoa so a lot more work than

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,569
I really thought it was because until

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,949
they can see that in visual form they

00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:43,920
just don't think it's that big of a job

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:46,259
but it's huge and and that this tends to

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,059
be the biggest bottleneck in all web

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,809
development projects at WordPress

00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:53,490
included acknowledged changes inevitable

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,559
we went over that just tell them it's

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,660
going to happen but I've got a process

00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,929
to keep it from impacting our budget and

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,309
so on and so forth

00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:03,660
abandoning the crystal ball approach I

00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,499
went over that let me see was there

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,339
anything else I want to tell you about

00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:10,110
that oh don't treat change like a

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,910
penalty to the client that's the other

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,339
thing I hear people talking all the time

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,959
well my hunt I tailed then I asked this

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,149
one guy said what's your change control

00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,149
procedure he said if it's not in the

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,759
contract it's out of scope okay so that

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,709
means the entire universe is out of

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,689
scope that's not a real good way to

00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:34,709
define what's in an out of scope for

00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:36,179
your project but so so stop treating it

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,089
like a penalty if you've done all this

00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,170
other stuff educating the client

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:45,149
explaining that change is inevitable and

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,170
done all that then a little sorry then

00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,149
you don't have to treat it like a

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,910
penalty then it's a thing you're working

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:52,649
on together to say to assess it and say

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,300
is this something we want to do now is

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,620
it something we want to do later or is

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,790
it something we really don't need to do

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,740
because it doesn't really meet any

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:05,730
business requirement positioning changes

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,949
opportunity sometimes I've had as many

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,899
as four phases on a project that was

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,730
only supposed to be one and that's

00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:13,829
because they can't they came up with new

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,319
ideas they were decided they wanted to

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:20,760
add some things the other thing that I

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,880
often do in this case is I use a Minimum

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:28,380
Viable website if the cut if the client

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,620
is hard fest I'm gonna do the content

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,690
I'm gonna get it all together but I know

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,250
because I've either observed them or I

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,910
can tell that they're all overworked and

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,850
then nobody has any time to devote

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:43,000
to this then I will say look give me the

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,890
content that you have let's build a

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,220
website a small little website around

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,950
that and then the whole rest of the

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,990
project becomes phase 2 and then

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,530
establishing and sticking to that change

00:17:52,990 --> 00:18:00,430
procedure what did I want to tell you

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,990
about that ok I wanted to ask how many

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,670
people in here have a written change

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:11,560
control procedure that you present to

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:14,050
the client so this needs to be part of

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,810
your contract because they need to agree

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,150
to do business with you the way you're

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,010
going to do business and this is another

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,310
thing that I've been coaching some of my

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,770
clients on is that you need to shop the

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,930
client just like they're shopping you if

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,750
they won't agree to follow your

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,010
processes or they show signs that

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,380
they're not going to follow your

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,390
processes then maybe you should move on

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,200
to a client that will work better with

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,520
your situation put it this is my

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,100
favorite one putting the client in

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,500
charge of change ok how many people can

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:52,060
be honest how many people pad their

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,250
estimates to cover change right ok why

00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,350
is this a bad idea the pad is bad that's

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,390
my new slogan the pad is bad and I'll

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,760
tell you why you can't measure it you

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,100
just put this arbitrary amount of money

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,090
on top of the quote for the project let

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,770
me back up a minute I'm gonna go off on

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,660
a little tangent here a minute and get

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,000
up on my soapbox and ask you to please

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,040
stop calling in a quote it's not a quote

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,230
it's an estimate an estimate by

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,490
definition will change you don't

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,840
estimate just at the beginning of the

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,760
project and you're done you estimate

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,110
throughout the project but you have to

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,020
make it clear to your client this is an

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:26,530
estimate ok so back to the change thing

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,530
so instead of the pad we can use a

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,570
change budget which accomplishes the

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,960
same thing but it allows us to measure

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,360
it as we go forward for example let's

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,660
say that let's say the project is $5,000

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,910
and I've decided to add 20% on top of

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,620
that as you pick whatever percentage you

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,650
want you got to figure out what works

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,559
best for you Kien used to use 30%

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,749
sometimes I'll use 20 or 30%

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,299
of the total that I've come up with and

00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:58,570
that is a separate budget in a separate

00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:01,269
bucket that is only touched to cover

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,159
change so let's say two or three weeks

00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,990
go by and the client says oh I forgot to

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,490
tell you about those five bio pages for

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,460
our senior executives that we've got to

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,950
have okay that's a change so we write up

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,789
the change we assess what the impact is

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,169
going to be we give it to the client

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:19,090
they see what the impact is going to be

00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,159
they either approve or decline it if

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,009
they approve it that money comes out of

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,679
that change budget hey y'all this is how

00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,330
you always come in under budget because

00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,860
that's part of the budget so you always

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,330
come in under if you've got enough in

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,399
your change of budget and there's not

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,809
any like you know ginormous complete

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,580
pivots or anything like that

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:39,429
and in that case you just have a really

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,799
big change request but so now the

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,779
clients in charge of am I going to take

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,970
that money out of that bucket and spend

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,220
it or not and that's what keeps them

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:52,960
from requesting so many frivolous

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,249
changes that aren't really necessary all

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,039
right what are the elements of a good

00:20:54,249 --> 00:21:01,179
change control process needs to have a

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:03,639
change budget needs to define what

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:05,440
change means because remember your

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,929
client doesn't know what you mean when

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,850
you say change they think that might

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,399
just mean change to the requirements but

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:16,480
it could mean change to the team change

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:18,460
to the timeline because you're Senior

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,840
Programmer have got in an accident so

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,940
you're not going to be able to meet the

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,919
timeline that's a change request it

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,749
might not affect the money but it's

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,929
still a change request that you submit a

00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:30,429
change control form for because then

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,679
when you go back and look at all of your

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,269
project documents you can see oh yeah we

00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,860
did that we got this done late but it

00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:39,549
wasn't because of anything that we did

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:42,669
wrong it was just act of god or whatever

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:44,440
so that the keeping those project

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,059
documents together in a project notebook

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,980
is another best practice that I adhere

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,749
to because that's how you know you're

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,360
getting better that's how you can look

00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:54,220
back at what you did before and figure

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,809
out oh this is why what this is why this

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,590
went south because we did it this way

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:02,080
let's do it a different way next time it

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,520
also identifies who can initiate the

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,230
change request that's

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,450
usually anybody on the team the client

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,400
can initiate it one of your team members

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,390
you can initiate it

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,130
that's the usually the way I word it it

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,680
established it must establish that

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,090
everything is in writing you don't just

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,710
do a change because the client asked you

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,630
to it has to be in writing has to be

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,760
signed by the client I know this sounds

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,860
really structured and strict doesn't it

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,170
but this is the one place you can be

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,820
loosey-goosey a lot of places this is

00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,220
one place if you want your projects to

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,050
get on time get finished on time and

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,880
within budget this is one place where

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,520
you do need to be really structured and

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,810
strict and you know what the deal is if

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,670
you talk to the client at the very

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,410
beginning about this stuff they're

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,060
usually happy that you're doing this

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,800
especially when you say you know all

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,330
those other guys they're not going to do

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,860
this and you need to ask them if they

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:55,840
padded their quote excuse me estimate

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,730
all right Oh

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,350
it identified who's going to do the

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,210
assessment and that's usually either you

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,340
or somebody else on your team is going

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,720
to assess the impact to the project is

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,690
it going to affect the budget the

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,640
timeline and so forth it also uses a

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,860
change request log this is the same

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,020
thing about documentation if you have

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,400
the change log for every one of your

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,290
projects you can see you know

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,090
consistently we are missing this one

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,590
thing and we're and that's is what and

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,690
it's coming up as a change later and

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:27,610
later over and over it specifies where

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,040
the change requests will be maintained I

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,660
usually keep a project notebook some of

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,880
those documents in the project notebook

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,770
I end up turning over to the client so

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,510
that if they go on to do other things

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,640
and they need all that documentation

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,770
they have it identifies who's going to

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,330
approve the change request that's a

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:49,180
no-brainer it's usually the client

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,890
specifies how long you give them to

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,930
either approve or decline the change

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,580
request because you know there's just

00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,990
like every other client you give it to

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,880
them and ask for it back in two days and

00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,830
then a week later they get it to you and

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,900
then of course that needs to specify

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,660
what happens if they don't respond in

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,870
the proper timeframe that's the next

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,090
thing on there it clearly states what

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:14,200
happens if there's a delay from getting

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:16,450
it approved and it specifies when the

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,820
payment is due now depending on the

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,090
court

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,760
I do this differently if I get a sense

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,450
that the client may not want to pay for

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,460
it later

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,110
I will invoice for it right away but if

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,300
I'm gonna do that I make sure that's in

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,740
my proposal and they understand that if

00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,110
there is a change that's a separate

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,910
invoice and a separate payment sometimes

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,560
especially if it's a client I know well

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,390
and I've worked with before I'll just

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,830
add it into the next regular payment

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:44,390
interval okay so now I'm going to give

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,400
you an example of a good change control

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,840
process now you can take pictures of

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,670
these slides or you can go to my website

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,350
because it's it's a free download and

00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:54,320
I'll give you I'll give you that

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:57,500
information in just a few minutes so you

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,940
can see here change for this project

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,770
includes any change to what is specified

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,010
in the approved statement of work and

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,290
then it specifies where what different

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,090
categories that could fall into now when

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,520
I say the statement of work I just want

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,920
to clarify I use a two-step proposal

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,610
process and in the proposal I don't give

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,680
us a system --it I give a range and then

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,020
I do the and I get a deposit that pays

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,910
me for the statement of work and then I

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,280
do the deep dive statement of work as

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,630
part of the project and if if at the end

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,670
of that process

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:32,600
my estimate and there weren't any big

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,730
changes and it does not exceed the range

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,010
I gave them we just keep going if it

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,330
does exceed the range I give the option

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,730
to client the option to cancel the

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,710
contract and that they hardly ever do it

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,930
I'll tell you why they hardly ever do it

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,060
but I give them that option because if

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,760
they choose to go somewhere else take it

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,170
to a low cost person to have it done I

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,210
don't care I've been paid for the

00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,410
statement of work go implement it but

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,150
you know what happens in today's

00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,310
environment a lot of times it's people

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,350
put so much detail in the proposal the

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,030
client never responds to the proposal

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,550
then they take that proposal to Fiverr

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,580
and get it done for nothing not very

00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,200
well but they get it done right so this

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,910
is why I do this in a two step process

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,020
and then I make sure that if they don't

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,560
want to do it if they want to go

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,240
elsewhere

00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,210
I've already been paid for the work that

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,950
I've done so I just need to dimension

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:25,700
that there okay this is where you state

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,880
who can request the change and that it

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,320
will be on a change request form then

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,909
the written request is

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,679
given to the project manager that might

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,179
be you you might have a project manager

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,490
on your team whoever you've designated

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:43,130
that is going to receive these things

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,759
and then the project manager or their

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,409
designee analyzes the change request and

00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,580
the impact to the project and updates

00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:51,919
the change request form with that

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,870
information then the project manager

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,470
ensures that the change request is

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,299
logged tracked and reported the project

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,889
manager presents the change request form

00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:04,909
to the client representative that's

00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:06,440
responsible for approving the change the

00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,539
change request must be approved or

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,519
rejected in writing within X number of

00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:13,639
days whichever days works for your

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,200
project if the client doesn't respond

00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:17,000
within the agreed-upon time frame the

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,490
change requests will be added as an item

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,139
on the issues log and fall under it the

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,559
issues management process and that's a

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:26,029
whole nother topic issues management we

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,460
don't do and most of us don't do a very

00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:34,129
good job of documenting and tracking

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:36,679
those either issues and risks both the

00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:38,840
project manager will maintain the change

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,299
control documents along with the change

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,009
request log absolutely no work

00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,990
associated with the change request will

00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:48,139
begin until formal approval is received

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:54,830
that's another mistake was that the 30

00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:56,629
minute mark okay the mistake that we

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,710
often make is we we know it's going to

00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:58,850
be approved so we'll just go ahead and

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,009
do the work and then we'll get the

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,570
signature later it's always a mistake

00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:03,679
just in case the client changes their

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,220
mind and then you've done all that work

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,110
for nothing when the changes approved

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,850
the project plan will be adjusted the

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,320
amount authorized will be subtracted

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,929
from the change budget added to the

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,820
project budget you may be invoiced

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,500
immediately for the approved change or

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,210
we may wait until the next scheduled

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,059
payment interval and then in big red

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:28,519
letters payment is expected upon receipt

00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:32,330
of the invoice so let's review what we

00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:35,590
went over in this little mini lesson you

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:39,799
need to educate your client on change

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,360
acknowledge change as inevitable abandon

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,700
that crystal ball approach and quit

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,070
trying to guess the future you need to

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,519
have

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:51,029
a detailed deep dive not just that to

00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,850
our discussion before you create the

00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:57,389
proposal there's no way you can find out

00:28:53,850 --> 00:29:01,019
everything in that two hours position

00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:03,779
changes opportunity phase to establish

00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,389
and stick to a good change management

00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,789
process not if it's not in the if it's

00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:12,239
not in the contract it's out of scope it

00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:15,479
still makes me laugh use a change budget

00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:18,330
and put the client in charge of it so

00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:22,649
that is my topic if you'd like to learn

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:24,869
more I have a tip sheet on six easy ways

00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:29,519
to control scope creep in your proposal

00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:31,229
I've got a little mini course on content

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,389
collection and using a Content first

00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:35,580
approach there's the first lesson is

00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:37,200
free the other is a paid product but

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,769
don't buy it because it needs to be

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,139
redone so I'm just saying don't buy and

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:46,109
then the other one is like is on those

00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,759
six principles and what I did was I took

00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:49,979
those six principles for software

00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,499
development and I modified them to be

00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:54,029
specifically for WordPress so the my

00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,220
first one instead of just defined the

00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:57,840
job in detail my first one is to find

00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,549
the job in detail with a content first

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,279
approach because I think that's the way

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:04,499
you need to do it and then like he had

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,879
get the right people involved I have yet

00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:07,049
the right resources involved because you

00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:08,639
also have to get the right plugins

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,109
involve the right theme involve the

00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,690
right hosting company so it's more than

00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:14,849
just people so that that's a little mini

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,879
course so you can see how I deliver

00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:20,009
courses online on those six principles

00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:21,869
and if you don't want any of that but

00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:25,440
you want to be kept notified of some

00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:27,359
free webinars detailed webinars that I'm

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,799
going to be having you can just text

00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,749
roadmaps 2 4 4 4 9 9 9 and that'll put

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,179
you on my email list and listen I hardly

00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:38,220
ever send an email so I need to get

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,169
better about that but this is mostly

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,789
just to be kept abreast of some things

00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:45,690
I'm working on that you might seriously

00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:48,450
be interested in the other way to learn

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,799
more is we do have a private Facebook

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,549
group called WordPress project

00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:55,210
management and so people share and

00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:57,760
engage and

00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,020
ask questions and so that's a safe place

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,430
where you can come and ask any kind of

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,160
question about project management that

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:06,250
you want the that and I managed that one

00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,320
the other one is just one I am in love

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,600
with this Facebook group these two guys

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,030
it's called the admin bar and they focus

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,680
more on the business side how to

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,200
increase your productivity on the

00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,850
business side they talk about tools they

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
talk about process they talk about

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,480
funnels yes

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,450
funnels for an agency business as well

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,040
as an online business and they're just

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,190
very laid back and the community's

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,800
really engaged so and I'm hoping to get

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:37,150
the project management group a little

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:39,970
more engaged as we move forward so my

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:45,970
slides are available on my website at

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:49,480

I would I would greatly appreciate that

00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:11,260
as well one thing I am working on is a

00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:13,960
complete framework with for WordPress

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,610
with project management with work

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,860
breakdown structure and all of that

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,030
stuff so if you want to be kept abreast

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,630
