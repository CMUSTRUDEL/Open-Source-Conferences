Description: 
	It is well known in the software and website development world that scope creep is the primary cause of projects running over time and budget. At the very least, uncontrolled scope creep will impact your project profit margin as you try and accommodate both legitimate and impractical client requests for change.
In this presentation, we will discuss how to minimize scope creep by acknowledging and planning for change instead of penalizing the client for it. We will cover the elements of a good change control plan and how acknowledging change up front can actually set you ahead of your competition and get you more clients.
Attendees will learn how to craft a good change control plan, how to educate the client regarding change, and how to use the change control plan as a selling feature. Attendees will leave with a sample written change control plan they can take and modify to meet their specific needs.
