Title: Micah Wood: Gutenberg - Leveraging the Block Editor
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	The new WordPress block editing experience, code-named Gutenberg, was released the end of last year. At the time, some people chose to temporarily opt out of using the new editor. As the WordPress ecosystem introduces better and better integrations with the new editor, letâ€™s take a closer look at what it looks like to use the block editor today.
This session will be a live demo with opportunities for interactive Q&A during the presentation.

so yeah so I've been working with

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,639
Gutenberg I've built sites in Gutenberg

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,639
I used Gutenberg and I know there's been

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,349
you know in the community when it first

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,910
came out you know a lot of people were

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,080
kind of questioning you know is this the

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,939
direction we need to go but ultimately I

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,949
think it's a wonderful tool but I think

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,490
it's important to understand kind of its

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,939
role in WordPress space and kind of what

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,640
the what the options are as well as you

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,770
know how you should best approach you're

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,040
using Gutenberg so how many people right

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,200
now use Gutenberg and how many people

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,730
have opted not to use Gutenberg for

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,160
right now okay

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,840
so it's kind of interesting so you know

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,489
I was getting ready to talk and I've

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,070
done several Gutenberg talks but I kind

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,559
of now that Gutenberg has been out for a

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,750
while and I you know I know that there's

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,579
some people that have been holding off

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,289
so been trying to figure out you know

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,199
like should I introduce you know kind of

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,159
the way I have before or should I

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,130
emphasize some other things so we'll

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,780
we'll see how it goes here but for those

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,960
that do want to kind of fall along with

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,930
the slides QR code is kind of small and

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,710
distant maybe but you can scan that on

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:24,330
your phone and I'll pull up the slides I

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:27,570
will post these on Twitter or something

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,130
after so may yeah so we're going to be

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,220
talking about the the block editor for

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,220
those that may not turn this thing on

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,680
let's try that again

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:52,040
all right well it's just gonna stay on

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:59,270
this slide apparently let's try this

00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:01,150
again there we are all right so for

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,900
those who may not know what Gutenberg is

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,490
essentially it's the new editing

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,640
experience in WordPress that came out in

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,500
version 5.0 so it's been out for a while

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:16,430
now and ultimately I think for most

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,590
people you know Gutenberg is either good

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,830
or bad right some people like it some

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,690
people don't think it's so great but

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,030
really I think what it boils down to is

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,430
you know most people have been using

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,110
WordPress for a long time kind of gotten

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,340
used the way things are and a lot of the

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,520
new people that come into WordPress

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,650
they're like oh this thing is great so I

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,740
think it's kind of like what was it

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,270
Henry Ford said if you think you can

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,470
you're right if you think you can't

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,300
you're right

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,330
so if you're willing to learn it and

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,800
give it a try I think it's a good thing

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,200
you know if you do happen to run into

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,900
bugs you know that's one of the things I

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,330
do is I try to contribute where I can

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,100
and and help with Gutenberg and other

00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,600
things in WordPress core and there's a

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,820
great team of people that works on

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,450
Gutenberg so if you do run into issues

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,220
don't don't be quiet about it you know

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,080
let us know there's some support forums

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,550
and there's a link here at the end too

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,380
if you do run into issues where you can

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,830
go and report them and that way we can

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,560
fix it and make it better so the goal

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,420
with Gutenberg is essentially to make a

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,610
new page and post building experience so

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,170
I'll make writing posts effortless so

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,480
ultimately this is kind of the classic

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,590
editor experience that we've had up

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,690
until recently and so it's it's it's

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,230
limited right so you kind of have this

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,959
big box that you can type into and you

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,019
can put images in and if you paste a URL

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,840
for a video or something it'll pop up

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,209
and turn into an bedded video so it's

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,829
got some cool features in there but

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,020
ultimately there's only so much you can

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,690
do so there's

00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,630
one of the kind of primary goals with

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,210
Gutenberg was to not have to require so

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,760
many plugins to be installed to get

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,680
things done in WordPress so most the

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,080
time we had things called short codes

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,600
that would add functionality and

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,700
different things but some of the most

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,640
common reasons that people would install

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,410
plugins and things was to you know I

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,770
want to be able to have buttons on my

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,360
website and easily put those in you know

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,710
I want to have a table display of

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
something on my website I want to be

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,690
able to do XYZ and with just the

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,000
standard editor it's just not really an

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,610
easy thing to do

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,400
to them now we have Gutenberg and it

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,800
looks like it does less because it looks

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,990
like there's less than the screen but

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,200
ultimately it's kind of a it's got a lot

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,170
you can do so this is the content area

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,730
and over to the right there we have the

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,470
document panel which is not always

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,060
visible sometimes it's hidden so there's

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,650
a little gear icon on the top right you

00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:00,320
can click that'll pop that little

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,700
document panel out and that I'm sorry

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,520
the yeah and then a little three dots

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,760
that's your global menu so there's a few

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,640
options in there that you can use to

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,870
turn and do things with given Burgh so

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,820
one of the cool ones here is the

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,540
full-screen mode so when you're editing

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,120
a page in WordPress one of the things

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,420
that Gutenberg does well is present you

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,700
the same view in the admin as you get on

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,420
the front end but the limitation there

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,520
is that you're kind of restricted with

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,560
because of the sidebar and WordPress and

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,420
all that full-screen mode makes that go

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,580
away and you can get a better idea as

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,280
you're editing what it's really gonna

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:45,260
look like on the front end you know

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,850
width wise and everything so and so we

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,760
have this thing called the inserter so

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,990
when you hover over a new block or in

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,390
the top left corner there we have a

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,740
little plus icon ultimately what that's

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,080
going to do is that's going to allow you

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,600
to add a new block and this little guy

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,510
here called the inserter will pop-up and

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,740
so that is how you will insert blocks so

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,419
you have all kinds of different blocks

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,479
your most commonly used ones will show

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,129
up there

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
off to the right you'll see some little

00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,990
greyed out icons those are your top

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,370
three most recently used or commonly

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,080
used blocks and then you know these

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,189
these items here will expand and

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,279
collapse so you can see all the

00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,050
different types of blocks that you have

00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,270
some plugins will add their own section

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,389
so if you have for example there's a

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,990
great plugin rich Tabor is here

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,110
somewhere

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,569
wrote called code blocks and so it has

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,189
its own section full of blocks awesome

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:43,889
things you can use but you can also type

00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,319
the slash and they will automatically

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,539
pull up a list as well so if you don't

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,879
like to take your hands off the keyboard

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:54,060
you can just type slash start typing the

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,889
name of a block hit you know enter when

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,539
you're ready to accept that particular

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,370
block and it will put it in there and

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,189
then you could start typing content into

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,330
that block so it's a great way way kind

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:08,129
of a shortcut to get content in quicker

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,370
so some of the design principles behind

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:13,830
Gutenberg is that again you should see

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,839
the same thing in the admin as you see

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,849
on the front end and when you're not

00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,919
actually editing a block it should look

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,810
the same way in the admin as it does on

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,209
the front end so when you have not

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,129
selected a block to do anything with it

00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,749
it should look exactly the way it will

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,629
on the front end and so this is an

00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:32,580
unselected block after you click on it

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,270
you'll get some more UI and things

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,319
around there where you can actually

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,209
manipulate and work with that particular

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,770
block and so you'll see some extra

00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,159
things kind of pop up there at the top

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,569
and the bottom and we'll talk a little

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,759
bit about what those are the first thing

00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,839
that happens though so if you look over

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,370
to the right we have that little

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,409
document panel we pointed out at the

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,870
beginning when you click on it that

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:59,009
document panel switches over and becomes

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,319
a block Settings panel so it switches

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,930
over to block mode and what that is

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,839
those are all your options for that

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,479
particular block that don't really make

00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,599
sense to put over in the in the content

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,669
area so if you wanted to for example add

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,009
some alt text that's not something you

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,420
see when you're working with an image so

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,930
it makes sense to kind of have that off

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,660
site so every block will have a block

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,110
Settings panel some things obviously

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,000
have more than others that you can edit

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,160
and then we have this block toolbar at

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,170
the top so any block that you click on

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,360
is going to have a toolbar with some

00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:39,090
actions that you can take one of the

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,880
coolest ones that can often be

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,890
overlooked is this block transformation

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,870
icon and so when you click on that if

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,340
you whatever type of block you may have

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,350
in this case and we have an image you

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,660
click on that and it'll pop open your

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,810
options for converting that block to

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,370
some other thing so in this case you

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,100
know we can convert this image to a

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,340
gallery to a cover image or even just a

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,150
file and so they'll have different ways

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:09,540
that we can render that image or add to

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,390
it by converting it so then the three

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,920
dots is always our menu essentially so

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,680
we have the global menu we saw earlier

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,230
this is the block menu so each block has

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,030
one of these so if you're trying to add

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,830
something before or after a particular

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,560
block you can always use this menu to do

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,510
that if you want to edit this specific

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,800
block as HTML you can do that just

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,870
forewarning certain blocks aren't really

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,260
meant to be edited that way and the

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,720
image block is probably one of those so

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,970
take that with a grain of salt

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,120
so you can also remove a block easily

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,950
that way so when you do have plugins so

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,350
plugins have a slightly different way in

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,240
Guttenberg of working and again some of

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,800
the plug-in ecosystem is still trying to

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,030
catch up to Gutenberg and catch up with

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,810
kind of all the features that are

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:59,850
available but plugins will have this

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,790
kind of icon in the top right and so

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,040
this is an example of the Yoast plugin

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,480
which has stuff at the bottom but I

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,620
think that's more out of convenience for

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,760
people that don't know you can also

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,200
click this button up here so that button

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,780
up there you click that and it

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,240
essentially opens up a panel that is

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,680
just for that particular plug-in and so

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,060
all the options and things that you can

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,970
do with that particular plug-in are

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,430
available there so in this case you know

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,310
it's going to scan your content for

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,810
potential SEO improvements and you'll be

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,640
able to see that right there now

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,090
obviously if you were to use the bottom

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,490
panel and the traditional like since

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,990
it's inconvenient it's always at the

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,900
bottom you have to scroll down you can't

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,580
look at your content and at the results

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,020
but in this case because we have this

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:54,720
panel makes that a little easier so then

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:57,270
we have yes so we have that icon the

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,030
gear icon as well which will drop down

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,790
and show your plugins in there as well

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:04,710
so you can switch over from the menu

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,140
into the code editor which will show you

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,760
all the HTML for those who are

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,370
interested in how the mark-up is

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,810
affected there's comments at the

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,090
beginning and end of each block so you

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,130
can kind of see what the blocks are when

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,600
you're looking at it so if for some

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,360
reason you wanted to go in and edit some

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,190
stuff then that's kind of what you'll

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,450
see and you can toggle that back and

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,040
forth if you do run into content that

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,390
you convert over I think Gutenberg

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,650
actually kind of does this automatically

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,600
now so you don't really have to worry

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,640
about it but if you do ever have a

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,350
classic block and you're you're kind of

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,060
stuck and trying to figure out how do I

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,040
get this to be the normal Gutenberg

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:47,460
stuff you can always use that menu off

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,100
of the toolbar or the block there and in

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,440
it that particular classic block has one

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,690
is the only one that can do it but if it

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,690
says switch to or convert blocks and so

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,220
will convert it into other blocks so now

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,140
I want to kind of give you a live demo

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,040
of some of the features and things that

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:07,590
you can do so one of the things that's

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,500
interesting about Gutenberg is a lot of

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:14,820
people they kind of think of it as a

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,250
page builder and it sort of is but it's

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,660
none and it's you know headed that

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,750
direction and maybe one day it's going

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,430
to be a full-fledged thing but right now

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,220
it's not necessarily a page builder

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,620
replacement right so the idea right now

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,720
is that it's just a richer way for you

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,030
to enter content into your website so

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
you think of your standard content that

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,889
you probably enter normally you might

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,959
have blobs of text some images maybe a

00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:45,189
you headings and things to break up so

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,509
that it doesn't look to lobby when

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:49,540
people are reading it so they can scan a

00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,759
little better right but ultimately you

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,999
know the web is about having a rich

00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:57,189
experience SEO is better when you have

00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:00,549
you know more media and things

00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:04,209
associated with it but really it's just

00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:07,209
about creating a better more rich

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:09,100
experience for users so we're in Atlanta

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,649
and around the corner is the coca-cola

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:18,189
headquarters so we're going to create a

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:19,299
little page for coca-cola here just to

00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,429
kind of demonstrate some of the features

00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:25,299
and how this works so we're gonna create

00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:27,720
a new block and this will be let's see

00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:31,569
so we have something called a cover

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,999
block and so what this does is it allows

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:38,919
you to take some image or thing from

00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:45,989
your media library and insert it in and

00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:50,379
we could say you know Atlanta home of

00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:52,929
coca-cola and at first this doesn't look

00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,179
all that amazing what we might want to

00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:58,720
do is convert this to a heading make the

00:13:55,179 --> 00:14:01,569
text look a little better anything that

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,519
supports Guttenberg will allow you to

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,379
not just have content within a

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,989
restricted area but allow you to expand

00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:13,749
that to to be wide or even fullscreen so

00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:17,410
we can do that if you have an image

00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:19,059
where where the focus matters there's

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,769
this cool little focal point picker

00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:23,709
where you can move that around and it'll

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:28,119
change the focus of where that is on the

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:31,569
image and then if we wanted to maybe

00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:33,549
give this more of a white overlay we

00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:35,049
could do that maybe we wanted because

00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:38,379
this is cocoa and it would be a little

00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:41,739
more red we could do that maybe not so

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:44,470
much red just a little less so you can

00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:46,029
adjust a lot of these things we can also

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,579
do a fixed background which is going to

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:53,440
give it that kind of cool parallax

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:56,250
scrolling effect and then we can take a

00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:01,509
look at some of the other blocks here so

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:03,579
let's do so again we can type slash and

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,860
that'll pop up your thing here so

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:09,370
without leaving the keyboard you know we

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,410
can we can do that let's do a media +

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,500
text so one of the common things that

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,329
was kind of difficult in the normal

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,379
editors just to get an image and put

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:23,379
content next to it so in this case we're

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,990
gonna take an image and stick it in here

00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:28,660
and then Oh automatically is gonna kind

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,930
of give us some larger text here you can

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,759
change the size of the texts by choosing

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,240
the font size or changing the number

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,240
over here

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:52,019
you can put some content in there we can

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:57,029
even add in a new button we can say get

00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:59,790
it now and so we have the ability to to

00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:03,420
also change the style of the buttons so

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,449
in this case we have here we can do

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,860
square or rounded edges or we can say we

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:10,800
want to kind of have more of an outline

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,430
feel to it and then we can even change

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,970
the the text color here to you know be

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,699
the the red color that matches

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,940
everything else now of course there's a

00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,690
very specific coke red but we are not

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,600
worried about that right now so yeah so

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,040
it you know kind of gives it now you'll

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,170
see this it kind of butted up against

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,420
here so maybe we want to insert

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:41,570
something before you can use this guy

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:46,410
here you can also if you're hovering

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:48,630
there a lot of times is a a little plus

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,880
icon that you'll see here that you can

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,329
hit that'll also work for inserting

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,829
something between two things so in this

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:58,410
case we're just going to put in a spacer

00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,589
a spacer is cool because you can just

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,600
drag it and make it have as much space

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,339
as you want it shows you in gray but of

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,199
course that's the selected state so when

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,030
you click away it's the unselected what

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,470
you'll see on the front end and it can

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,059
give you the control to give the space

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,799
that you want without having to do

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:19,740
anything too complicated so then we have

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,880
some other cool blocks in here so let's

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,880
do a pull quote

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:36,049
if I could give the world cook I think

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,760
it was bill backer that actually did

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:42,980
that so here again we have some styles

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,419
different styles that we can pick so in

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,750
this case we have kind of the default

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:49,760
but we can do a solid color background

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,120
you know maybe we want to go with that

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,679
red color again just to make it look you

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,539
know we can't go off-brand

00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,440
client would get real mad if we did that

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:03,139
so and we want to have white text and

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,389
again we still have the ability to send

00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:11,059
these things fullscreen or maybe just do

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:14,419
kind of a wide version there's also some

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,750
really cool features with columns for

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:19,190
example so one of the things that can be

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,840
super difficult in the traditional

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,039
editor is just getting two images side

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,840
by side in this case this gives you the

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:32,809
ability to do some interesting things so

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:38,870
you can do columns and so right now by

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:47,720
default we have two columns and so let's

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:52,940
put in some content hi there so these

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,409
particular blocks let's see the one

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,399
thing that I'd have found it is a little

00:18:54,409 --> 00:19:02,779
difficult to to do which I would like to

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:05,870
get fixed is to actually get to the

00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:08,750
column screen so what I found though is

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:12,470
that you actually this little gray thing

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:16,820
here if you can click on the gray it'll

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:20,630
let you get to the column block screen

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,830
which is this over here so the so right

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,590
now we have two columns let's say we

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:30,850
want to do bump that up to four and

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:32,520
let's let's actually make ourselves a

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,890
image

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,690
so this will be a traditional image will

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,140
choose something so I got some cool

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,140
icons here that we can use so we can

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,140
drop these in and align them to the

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:55,630
center and we can insert a few of these

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:57,460
guys from the media library and it gives

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,590
us the ability to do some cool little

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,570
layouts that you would definitely not be

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,570
able to do very easily otherwise

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,940
so I kind of wanted to I I realize that

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,010
this part could be very boring if I'm

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,780
just you're watching me but kind of

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,260
wanted to show off you know some cool

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,300
things they can do and and you know do

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,720
it live so that you can see it's not

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:31,140
that difficult and sometimes when you

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:36,120
put it in a slideshow you easily skip

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:40,670
over the details so yeah and so you can

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:52,170
insert text down here you know it helped

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:54,530
what is this one graduate give back be a

00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,530
star

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,210
and so you know you might want to also

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,880
Center the text here to match up with

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,880
your icons so that everything looks nice

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,250
yeah so you get the ability to kind of

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:13,750
create these cool little layouts let's

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,340
see one of the other things is let's see

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,929
we need some filler text in here let's

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:24,950
get some lorem ipsum I should really

00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:26,690
have a shortcut that just fills in lorem

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,410
ipsum for me but I always find myself

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:34,340
just copying it from somewhere like this

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:40,460
so we'll put in a few few bits of that

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:43,160
in here let's see so what we're gonna do

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,080
is go ahead and put in a gallery

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,540
actually I'm gonna put in a regular

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,090
image just so you can see kind of how

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,240
this works so images are something that

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,920
people deal with a lot and I think it

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,220
can be difficult if you've not done that

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:03,140
before so in this case let's just take a

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:06,080
I think this one's well don't Baker this

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,630
was much bigger stick that one in so

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,710
this is a really big image so let's say

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,480
we wanted to wrap text around this image

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,900
but it's too big for anything to wrap

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:23,630
around it you can click to show it at 50

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:25,190
percent 25 percent 75 percent or if it's

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,790
not quite what you want you can just

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,320
drag it to change it to get it right

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,720
where you want to get all the words to

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,280
line up however you want so that's

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,679
that's nice so let's just take a quick

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:41,960
look at what with God before we go any

00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:43,670
further and let's view the page so this

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,429
is what we've created so far so you can

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,290
see we got a cool little parallel

00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:51,590
parallax thing going on so I got all our

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:54,470
bubblies at the top we've got the mobile

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,620
app get it now

00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,170
we've got a nice little thing here cool

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:06,509
little icons underneath and then you

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:08,999
know there's our thing here so we can

00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,859
come back here so you know actually what

00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:13,229
I really want is a gallery so let's use

00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,259
our block transform and we'll take this

00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:18,929
to a gallery and we're gonna Center it

00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:21,449
here obviously when you add more images

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:25,579
so we could upload an image here we

00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:27,839
could drag stuff into it and this is

00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:30,719
anytime you have an image typically

00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,249
you'll see this little pencil icon and

00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:34,829
that's how you'll kind of just click on

00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:38,819
it and then come in to add new things to

00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:43,349
the gallery so you could click on I

00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:47,819
don't know a few things here let's put a

00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:49,919
bunch of stuff in for now and of course

00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,019
in this screen this is where you can

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,819
easily just kind of rearrange things so

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,389
if you know you want to kind of spread

00:23:53,819 --> 00:24:00,719
out certain things you can do that hit

00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:05,519
update and so here we have three columns

00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:08,759
in our gallery and we can also you know

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,729
drag this slider or use the up and down

00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,039
keys to change that so anytime there's

00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:15,269
kind of an odd you know you have four

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,279
columns and there's kind of this odd

00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,749
number like right now we have six it's

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,759
going to take the extra things and put

00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:23,159
it at the bottom and kind of even those

00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:27,269
things out so it kind of makes it look

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,219
pretty cool in my opinion but yeah you

00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:31,919
can you can take it to five and you'll

00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:33,899
have one big one and five small or

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,849
however you want to do that so obviously

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:39,269
you have control on how many things are

00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:44,449
in there and exactly how many columns

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:48,239
you end up with so let's do two and

00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:51,599
we'll leave it like this here so so

00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:54,119
let's see what happens if we save that

00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,719
and we come over here and refresh so

00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,699
we've got our our gallery here so what

00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:02,969
does this look like when we size it down

00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:05,789
to a mobile screen for example so if I

00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:08,309
were to take this down and size it down

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:12,839
size it down you know what happens with

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:17,940
this guy is when you hit a certain point

00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:20,149
is it going to stay that one stays if we

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,149
have

00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:27,290
don't go down at all whoops

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,270
you know it's all relatively good at

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:38,040
being responsive there are certain cases

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:45,540
in which things will stack because

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:48,660
zoomed in there there we are so yeah and

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,010
our columns look like they get a little

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,920
interesting they're on a small screen

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,220
but but yeah so it's going to give you

00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,740
the ability to do a lot more than you

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,940
would normally be able to do without

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,660
extra tools in WordPress so and you

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:11,870
still have the ability to take a video

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:14,610
and paste it in somewhere so you can

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:20,070
paste in the URL and it'll still do it's

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:21,600
WordPress thing and link it up or one of

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,380
the beautiful things about the whole

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,370
idea of this inserter is that when you

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:31,320
have blocks there's no guessing as to

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:34,980
what you have available right so

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,620
everything can be found and so you can

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,410
just click here and let's say you know

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,060
you want to embed something you know

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,090
there's YouTube Twitter Facebook

00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,370
Instagram you can even bed from other

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,650
WordPress sites so there's all kinds of

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,560
things you can do maybe you know you

00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:55,350
want to embed a video but you don't know

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,730
what video options there are so now it's

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,090
going to show you everything that could

00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,090
possibly contain a video so you can even

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:06,900
have a video with text to the side you

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,180
can embed a YouTube video so and in the

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,430
case of this these are this is

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,710
essentially a placeholder where you can

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,530
just pop in your URL when you hit in bed

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,940
it's going to do the same thing so

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:21,170
obviously it would be easier to just

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,170
paste in the URL

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:28,010
and have it flop it in for you but that

00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:31,000
works another thing you can do so I have

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,260
in the clipboard the link for the video

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,630
one of the cool features is that you can

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,620
just highlight some text and then when

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:42,260
you use your keyboard to paste it

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,900
actually will take that highlighted text

00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,720
and automatically turn that into a link

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:51,710
so now that's all you have to do to get

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:58,670
a link on the page you also have the

00:27:51,710 --> 00:28:10,550
ability to its oh you what do you mean

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:11,960
like with that correct yeah so it'll

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:15,160
take whatever you've highlighted and

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:19,660
convert that into a link pasting

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:23,120
whatever you pasted is the yet is zero

00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,670
so then we have this is our block

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,710
navigation so if you happen to have a

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,560
really long page and you're trying to

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:34,430
figure out where something is you don't

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,710
have to guess you can just click and

00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:40,220
it'll take you straight to that block so

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,930
when you do have long nested things you

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,470
know it's it's easier to find what

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,570
you're looking for so you also have kind

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,950
of this informational helper here will

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,180
tell you about how many words you have

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,000
on the page

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,310
how many headings paragraphs total

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,710
number of blocks it also shows you kind

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:01,970
of this nested structure and it will

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,730
even highlight things if you get

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,140
headings out of order for example you

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,390
know that can make a difference with SEO

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,790
and things like that and it'll notify

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:14,240
you if you click over here and take a

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:19,190
look let's see some of the other things

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,900
that it does so in this case you know we

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,900
have red and white which is

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,290
can be difficult for people to read and

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,750
so this is kind of an accessibility

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,490
thing but you can see here it says this

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,280
color combination may be hard for people

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,930
to be able to read try using a darker

00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,430
background or a brighter text color so

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:47,270
when it detects that you've got kind of

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:49,250
this ratio that's off it'll tell you so

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,490
yeah so that is kind of the quick

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:55,340
rundown of Gutenberg one more thing that

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,450
is very helpful so obviously it took us

00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,750
a little while to kind of create this

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:04,190
whole structure here with all the

00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:07,520
columns and everything so one of the

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,440
things that you can do let's say we have

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,440
a particular block something like this

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:17,000
here that we want to use again we can

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:21,290
come to the block menu and click Add to

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,600
useable blocks and we can just give it a

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:27,370
name let's call it mobile app or

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,200
something so we can then save this and

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:34,220
now this is a block called mobile app

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:39,080
and so then what we can do is we can

00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:42,470
take the we can go to create a new page

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,380
for example well maybe we'll save what

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:50,300
we did so we're going to create a new

00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:53,840
page and what we'll do is we'll you know

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:57,080
call this test or something and so now

00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,890
when we come in to essentially add a new

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,650
item one of the things that you'll see

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,510
is we have this reusable section so this

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,300
is where any reusable blocks that you've

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,410
saved live and so you can see that we

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,000
have a mobile app it's even going to

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,400
kind of give us a preview here of what

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,110
we've created and so then when we click

00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,430
it it's going to insert that into our

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:21,890
page and we can then you know use that

00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:24,770
to start creating other pages so this

00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:27,350
can be very helpful especially if you've

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:32,730
got content that you want to manage from

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:37,059
one place so you can come up to the

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:38,650
to the menu here and come to manage all

00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,120
reusable blocks and that's going to take

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,440
you to the section here where you can

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,170
see all your blocks that are reusable

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,300
that you've created so now you can

00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,100
actually click in and manage this block

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,860
from one place and it'll affect the

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,980
entire website so if you do have for

00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,840
example you know something that you want

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,540
to use across the whole site it just

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,000
makes it really easy so part of the

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,500
direction that Gutenberg is going is is

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,210
in a direction where ultimately the goal

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,520
is to give you the ability to edit your

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,580
own theme so as you can see if you have

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,900
something like man reusable blocks you

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,360
would be able to create your own header

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,830
and that header would be applied to the

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,050
entire site but you have a place now

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,670
where you can come to edit it you could

00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,559
create a footer and that footer could go

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,390
wherever you want it but at the same

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,830
time you could have multiple headers and

00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,000
you could say well these pages are going

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,400
to use this header and these pagers are

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,320
gonna use that header and so you could

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,720
you can start to work it out way so you

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,610
can see how you know as beatenberg

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,920
starts to grow just beyond managing the

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,800
content block how that can give you a

00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,110
lot more power and control and actually

00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,490
a lot more flexibility I think one of

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,320
the biggest questions that most people

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,540
ask when they first get started with

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,030
WordPress is what themes should I use

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,800
well it won't be long and the question

00:32:55,030 --> 00:33:00,280
that that question will go away there's

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,110
no need to use a theme necessarily you

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,630
can just do whatever you need to with

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,090
Gutenberg so so that's kind of the

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,710
direction that we're headed and we have

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,970
time for questions so if you have

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,240
questions

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:17,360
a resource page for documents videos of

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:22,360
the searchable for customers to go in

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:25,410
and for members to find whether it's

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,410
[Music]

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,950
yeah so being able to just like create

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,170
one page where you can do a search

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:40,090
across a bunch of different media types

00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,679
so creating the page itself and laying

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,110
things out is one thing the

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,830
functionality we still are gonna need

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,450
plugins so there's always and that's the

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,980
thing is that there's a clear should be

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,470
a clear distinction between themes and

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,750
plugins themes being the display of

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,700
content and that's all that they do I

00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,890
think a lot of themes in WordPress do

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,760
too much already they try to control

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:05,020
functionality and in some cases people

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,120
like to have that bundle where

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,280
everything's just together but

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,409
ultimately if you want to move away from

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,090
that theme to something else you don't

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:14,440
want to lose your functionality either

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,800
so that's the problem that a lot of

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,030
people run into so yeah plugins are

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,310
always going to be necessary in my

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,990
opinion you can layout the page but the

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,330
functionality of doing the searches and

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:29,429
all that kind of stuff is plug-in

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,429
territory so yes

00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:41,530
I haven't tested that but you should be

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,780
able to oh yeah sorry he was asking

00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:47,889
about columns if you could do for

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,960
example nested columns and to be honest

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:55,859
I haven't really tied around with that

00:34:49,960 --> 00:35:00,430
too much but here we have a column and

00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:04,359
we can do another column and that column

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:07,980
has two columns inside of it so yeah you

00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:11,770
can you can get complicated if you want

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,910
obviously at some point you go too far

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:31,720
enough thing it's gonna look weird but

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:32,890
yeah so the question is how can you get

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,319
rid of the header footer if you want

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:37,510
full control the page there's a great

00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:39,309
little plugin friend of mine put

00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,160
together called blank slate that will

00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:44,049
get rid of the header and footer yeah I

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,490
would have demoed it but I realized and

00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,690
I was helping him write something good

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,160
for it I realized that it doesn't

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,630
actually work that great with Guttenberg

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,589
because it strips out some of the styles

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:57,309
so I got to go fix that but you know

00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:59,910
I'll fix it so other questions yes blank

00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:59,910
slate yeah

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,849
so that is a good question

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,650
and so the question is how does

00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,359
Gutenberg integrate with other page

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:13,680
builders and that is exactly why I have

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,990
another page builder that I can turn on

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,570
so I've got Elementor here so I'm going

00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:21,570
to turn it on and just tell it I don't

00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,940
need to read the guide so we'll come to

00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,970
our page

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,430
and so as you can see we've edited this

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,980
page here with Gutenberg and then it

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,329
says you know edit with Elementor so a

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,270
lot of these page builders they're gonna

00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:38,010
have their own interface for doing that

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,630
and so you can click Edit with Elementor

00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,820
and it's gonna spit you out on the front

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,829
end and so anything that you've creating

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,160
Gooden burg is just HTML content it may

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:49,260
look a little different not have all the

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,280
exact styles or whatnot so you may have

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,760
to kind of tweak it a little bit

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,079
generally you don't want to take content

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,339
editing goober get it into page builder

00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,900
and then go back to try to edit in the

00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,780
other that's not going to work very well

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:05,130
so it's best to start in one thing and

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:08,310
and go from there ultimately the nice

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,020
thing is you can use the page builder on

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,800
certain pages and Gutenberg on other

00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,930
pages and that will work perfectly so

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,190
friend of mine actually does this page

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:21,480
builder breakdown he installed at 1.8

00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,990
entirely different page builders and he

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,119
was able to use all of them together so

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,750
should work pretty well theoretically so

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,880
question about

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,880
[Music]

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,530
good okay yeah what is a good place to

00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,430
go for training for Gutenberg for

00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:44,650
clients I would say give them a place

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,940
where they can play with it there I

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,890
think it might still be up there's this

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:53,080
thing called fronting Berg dot-com I

00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,580
think hopefully I'm not going to some I

00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:00,670
probably shouldn't just do that on there

00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:03,070
but it's called fronting Berg yes okay

00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,600
so yeah time for one more question so

00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,760
yeah there's fronting Berg and now

00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,710
there's a link so when I post the slides

00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:14,430
at the very end there's some resources

00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:14,430
for training and how to's so question

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:28,230
okay yeah so how did I get to the image

00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:32,470
or the median text block as well as the

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:35,230
what was the other cover block okay yeah

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,960
so ultimately all of the blocks of any

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,320
kind are gonna live in here so if you

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,770
just search cover it's gonna pull up the

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,040
cover block or media as long as you

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,900
remember the names you should be able to

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,700
pull them up and then click enter and

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,320
then it will it'll plop you in there and

00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,580
then you should be able to start

00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,580
creating this content so

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:05,299
oh yeah the parallax so essentially all

00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,279
that is when you're on this this block

00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:09,829
is you just toggle on the fixed

00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:11,690
background so if it's not fixed the

00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:14,059
image will scroll with everything but if

00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,920
it's fixed then it kind of gives you

00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,950
that cool the image stays put everything

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,339
else moves effect so I think I was all

00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:24,160
the questions we have I will be around

00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:26,660
in the green shirt

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,099
wherever feel free to find me ask

00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:32,299
questions there is a happiness bar that

00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:34,279
should be open to if people have

00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:37,740
questions or need specific help there

00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:43,779
would be people to help so appreciate it

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,779
