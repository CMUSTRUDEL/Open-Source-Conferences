Title: Micah Wood: Gutenberg - Leveraging the Block Editor
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	The new WordPress block editing experience, code-named Gutenberg, was released the end of last year. At the time, some people chose to temporarily opt out of using the new editor. As the WordPress ecosystem introduces better and better integrations with the new editor, letâ€™s take a closer look at what it looks like to use the block editor today.
This session will be a live demo with opportunities for interactive Q&A during the presentation.
