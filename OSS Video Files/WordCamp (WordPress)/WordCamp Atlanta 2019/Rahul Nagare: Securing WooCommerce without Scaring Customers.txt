and thanks everyone for coming this is

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,099
my first time visiting this orange room

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,540
and for some reason it feels like I'm in

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,490
Star Wars or something because of the

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,090
seedings and all that so I'm Rahul I've

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,539
been using WordPress for 10 years now I

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,019
started my manage hosting company in

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,789
testify in 2014 and since then I have

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,820
managed security of around 12,000

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,669
websites and today I will share some of

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,550
those security tips with you i'm on

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,050
twitter at nginx reload and if you have

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,450
any questions about WordPress or

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,120
WooCommerce security in general I will

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,980
be here all weekend you can just ask my

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,410
Twitter or just catch me in the hallways

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,449
in high school one of my friends came up

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,440
to me and said hey can you hack Facebook

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,360
and of course that was impossible but I

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,340
thought there might be a way so I

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,579
created a fake facebook login page that

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,739
looked like this and every time someone

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,619
tried to login it would email me their

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,450
username and password and back then

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,659
people were expecting Facebook to launch

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,090
themes they didn't have any options back

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,619
then they don't have it now but so I

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,439
sent a message to all my teachers

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,970
friends people and you follow this link

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,909
and you can download themes for Facebook

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,400
and every one of them tried to log in

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,240
right away by end of the day I had

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,909
everyone's usernames and passwords and I

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
did what you would expect I did their

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,770
messages change their relationship

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,200
status and such I may have also started

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,649
fights between a couple of friends and

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,420
that was a fun weekend I thought I found

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,049
this big security issue with Facebook

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,820
and I went online to brag on security

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,159
forums here I found this exploit with

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,340
Facebook can they pay me or something

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,880
and people who are like here you did

00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,619
phishing

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,479
it's no big deal people have been doing

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:06,060
this for forever and my first thought

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,759
was what is phishing so I looked it up

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,770
and that led me to like interesting

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,269
social engineering aspects of security

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,129
how people can

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:18,890
implement security and get around

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,560
security over the years I have found

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:25,189
that security is usually implemented in

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,219
two ways one it's invisible but

00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,200
effective and the next one it's

00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:32,959
intrusive and annoying maybe not even

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,409
than effective let's look at some

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,500
examples every time I'm in the Bay Area

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:42,709
I like to visit Google campus I pick a

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,470
building that looks like this take out

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:49,609
my laptop sit on a bench I just continue

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:52,849
with my work I like to pretend I work at

00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,139
Google but I keep that to myself and I

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,540
have been doing this for a couple of

00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:59,000
years and no one has come up to me and

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,680
asked me what I was doing there no one

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,280
told me to leave I have never seen

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,930
security but at the same time I can't

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,709
access their Wi-Fi networks

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,760
I can't enter in the office buildings I

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:16,280
can't access any of Google's data and

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,319
it's pretty secure and don't ask me how

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,419
I know this but if you try to take those

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,750
orange coffee tables with you security

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:26,030
does show up and the other type of

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,739
security that's what I call invisible

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,040
but effective security and the other

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:33,260
type is was this it's like the time you

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,680
go to a fancy store and the store clerk

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,079
doesn't stop following you and they

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,799
might be able to like protect some of

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:44,419
their things prevent shoplifting but I

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,530
certainly wouldn't go back to that store

00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:52,280
again and this type of security is also

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,889
visible online let's look at the example

00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,049
of Amazon I took this screenshot this

00:03:54,889 --> 00:04:02,030
morning and even today in 2019 amazon

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,699
says have at least six characters in

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,650
your password so you can create an

00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,989
account with password like ABC one two

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,709
three and they won't stop you

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:14,479
and steal your account won't get hacked

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,820
but at the same time if you try to do

00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,070
anything funny with Amazon or do any

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,270
sort of automation like access them from

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,919
command line you get blocked right away

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,260
you're not even logged in yet but they

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,350
just

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,770
give you the access this is also visible

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,440
on eBay the site works you can have weak

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,620
passwords but on the command line it

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,150
will say page not found this is what I

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,570
like to call the invisible but effective

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:46,860
security and on other hand there's

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:49,080
Equifax they have all sorts of password

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,760
requirements you are not able to use

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,020
password managers you can't face

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,910
passwords in there and this still got

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,790
managed they still got hacked anyways

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,800
and if you use any automation it works

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,590
just fine they will even set cookie is

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,390
thinking this is a real browser as a

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,490
WooCommerce store owner you should have

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,370
security like Amazon and not like

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,740
Equifax but when it comes to WooCommerce

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,460
there are some extra steps that are

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,620
required for security because it's a bit

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,860
different compared to WordPress when it

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,690
comes to security incidents because if

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,080
you think about it what happens when

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,210
WordPress gets hacked hackers redirect

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,610
your site to somewhere else they show

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,650
some ads about Canadian pharmacies they

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,550
install some like Bitcoin miners on your

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,590
site and at that point you just update

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,680
your plugins restore backup and move on

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:47,810
right but what happens when WooCommerce

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,330
get sacked hackers get access to your

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:56,070
customer data your credit card process

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,170
or api's your UPS FEDEX USB is shipping

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,350
and fulfillment service provider data

00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,720
they also get access to if you do drop

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,300
shipping any competitive advantage you

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,150
may have hackers can see all of that and

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,940
on the customer side if your store

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,400
appears hacked you have to be really

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,930
good at or have really unique products

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,260
for customers to come back or they will

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,420
just go somewhere else and this sort of

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,450
damage is much more difficult to recover

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:29,670
from than just like restoring backup and

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:32,580
starting over now if you run a good

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,320
hosting good WooCommerce store you make

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,560
good amount of money chances are you're

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,820
using a managed hosting provider don't

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,270
they take care of this

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,910
well yes and no good hosting provider

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,150
will like update plugins WordPress core

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,290
keep it secure

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,860
they will also protect you from

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:56,310
brute-force attacks any malware some

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,230
hosts will also do security scans and if

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,390
your site is in danger they will send

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,920
you alerts they might charge you for

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,780
cleanup or they do they might do that

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,520
for free but it's still your

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,540
responsibility to keep WooCommerce

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,250
secure a good hosting provider will not

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,710
be able to protect you if you have

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,690
insecure themes or if you tried

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,700
something on Stack Overflow and copied

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,060
that to your theme and it created a

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,370
security hole they won't be able to

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,950
protect you if you have weak passwords

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,780
on your GoDaddy account or your UPS or

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,940
FedEx or stripe accounts or PayPal

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,120
account your hosts won't be able to do

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,590
anything to protect you in that case

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,600
they also won't be able to protect you

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,730
if you hire someone on freelancer and

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,030
they still have your access to your

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,700
website two years later so having a good

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,440
hosting provider is a good start but you

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,610
still need to do a bit more to protect

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:55,470
WooCommerce now what sort of security

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:59,340
issues affect conversions the first one

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,110
is lack of SSL this is pretty obvious in

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,900
this day and age if you don't have SSL

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,600
browser show message like this they will

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,580
mark your site not secure and that's

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,030
pretty effective in people taking their

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,030
business elsewhere

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,090
the next is next thing is even if you

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,980
have SSL and if your site shall mix

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,580
content warnings if you are loading some

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,440
fonts on HTTP and not on HTTPS browsers

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,470
will still show this site may not be

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:34,380
fully secure and that also affects

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:37,620
convergence this next one is a bit

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,560
ironic people install six security

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,570
plugins on WooCommerce to secure their

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,810
site but every now and then a lot of

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,120
security plugins will try to log every

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,770
visitors IP in the database they will

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,350
also do some query strings some

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,510
interesting things to protect your site

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,570
but they also slow it down so if you use

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,010
Facebook ads any sort of like being

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,220
shopping campaigns Google Shopping

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,720
campaigns and the visitor you're paying

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,720
for that visitor to come to your site

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,330
and the site is not loading fast enough

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,790
they just go somewhere else so not only

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,310
you lost on that conversion you also had

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,970
to pay for a visitor that never reached

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:21,420
your site next one is aggressive

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:23,730
captures if users have to type something

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,180
like this on the checkout page they may

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,180
not come back

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:34,110
next is trigger-happy firewalls these

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,570
are the security plugins or hosting

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,470
rules that block users if they enter

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:44,070
wrong password three or four times and

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:47,430
this happens to me a lot I remember of

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,530
website I used to shop a while ago I go

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,560
to that site none of my passwords work

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,560
of course so I tried the reset password

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,660
function some sites are pretty

00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,580
aggressive that I tried three passwords

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,910
and they just block me I move on to the

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,470
other side some sites allow forgot

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,590
password and they have security

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,390
questions like what's your favorite song

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,840
and then I have to remember what was my

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,640
favorite song in January again I have to

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,070
go through like two or three songs none

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,130
of them work and in that process if the

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,630
site just blocks me for two hours I will

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,450
just go to Amazon and buy something else

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,030
and this is more common than you would

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,030
think if you have complex password

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,700
policies or if you force users to have a

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,230
password that's too secure they're not

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,870
going to remember that or they will

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,730
either write it down somewhere or they

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,830
won't have that handy if they're

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:45,530
shopping from their phone which is

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:47,850
happening more and more these days and

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,770
only banks can have requirements like

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,770
this and still have people buy from them

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,580
finally emails that end up in spam so if

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,550
you run any marketing campaigns or if

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,160
you send shipping and payment receipts

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,270
and that end up in spam not only that

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,300
affects your

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:12,240
you also lose out on the ROI on the

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,070
marketing campaigns and the conversion

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,450
rates and effectiveness of your

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:22,440
messaging so let's look at how to fix

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,960
those issues first one is installed SSL

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,680
every host now has let's encrypt it's a

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,820
good start oh you need to use good

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,410
hosting provider sorry so step one is

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,460
first advice everyone will give you use

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,960
a good hosting provider and how do you

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:46,530
know if your hosting provider is good or

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:48,870
not I like to do a few tests I like to

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,610
call hosting support from a different

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,490
phone number then what's registered on

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,430
my account and see if they ask me for

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,470
last four characters of my password and

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,660
if they do I just go to a different host

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,610
and there are some companies that do

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,590
that and no one should have access to

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,390
your password or part of your password

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:12,480
so that's not a good start when you log

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,589
into FTP on your hosting account you

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,410
shouldn't be able to see other people's

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,150
directories you may not be able to

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,060
access them but even if you just see

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,010
their usernames it's a good start to do

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,589
some social engineering contact support

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,970
and try to get access that way so no one

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,900
should be able to see your directories

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,600
you shouldn't be able to see other

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,750
people's directories and this usually

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,880
happens on SFTP so check if you can see

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,330
other data on once you log into SFTP

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,370
next is see if you can log a download

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,380
sequel files or get or backup files

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,080
without having to login to your site and

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,650
that usually works when you have backup

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,950
plugins and you can go to your site comm

00:12:52,650 --> 00:13:00,000
slash WP content updraft is a good

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:02,700
suspect and just like back up to dead

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,030
State or tart or cheesy see if that

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,270
works if that happens you can if you're

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,460
on Apache you can update the HT access

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:17,520
rules or contact your hosts and fix this

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:19,590
for you next one is using SSL so you can

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,360
use let's encrypt

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,000
and if you still have mixed content

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,180
warnings on your site you can use really

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,110
simple as a cell plug-in yeah it's

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,420
pretty good next is using strong

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,970
passwords everywhere and not just your

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,650
hosting account and WordPress you should

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,970
also have unique passwords on your

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:45,150
stripe PayPal UPS FEDEX and your drop

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,010
shipping providers your email and the

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,650
tricky here is using a password manager

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,930
I like to use one password and that

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,640
allows me to set a unique password for

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,320
each service and I don't have to

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,580
remember any of that it also syncs with

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,320
other devices so it will give you unique

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,090
and strong passwords for each service

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,520
and even if they get hacked that

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,910
password will not be usable on any other

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,360
of your accounts next is using

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:16,260
two-factor authentication so even if a

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,840
service gets hacked and hackers are able

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,430
to decrypt your password this won't be

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,100
usable if they don't have access to your

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,560
phone and two-factor authentication will

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:29,430
send you a text message or usually have

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,730
an app that will send you a one-time

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:35,310
password that's required to log in apart

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,120
from your password and that adds an

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,350
extra layer of security next is you

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,930
should offer two-factor authentication

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,630
to your customers with WooCommerce in

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:49,170
WordPress you can use odd 0 plugin or

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,820
Google Authenticator plugins so even if

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,650
your customers password is compromised

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,700
or if they have password like Amazon's

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,310
policy abc123 they will still be secure

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,470
as long as no one has access to their

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,200
phone so it adds an extra layer of

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,660
security without forcing your users to

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,510
have weird passwords or having them

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,790
write it down or remembering it and they

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,530
will more they will be more inclined to

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,180
buy from you if you make it easy for

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:20,190
them to log in next is if you have

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,290
captures if you get a lot of pod traffic

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,330
on your site you can use invisible

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:29,040
capture with plugins like advanced

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:31,420
capture or invisible capture so this

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,610
will not ask your users to enter

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,800
anything on the login or checkout pages

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,170
but if someone is trying anything

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,150
automated they will get blocked and they

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,620
will have to solve that challenge and it

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:47,230
works out pretty great in keeping the

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,790
actual users and buyers safe on your

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,010
site without having to go through extra

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:59,440
straps or having them jump through hoops

00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:01,930
to just to buy something from you when

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,440
you send out emails you should use SMTP

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:09,160
plugin and not rely on hosting your

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,110
hosting providers email delivery system

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,410
so you can use services like send great

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,660
mailgun spark posts that's a lot of

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,390
services now and you can get started for

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,840
free and this will make sure your emails

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,590
don't end up in spam and emails are

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,140
always delivered with Gmail it also

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:32,740
shows that this mail was sent securely

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:36,850
over TLS and that also increases a bit

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,820
of trust now how do you know if your

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:45,430
WooCommerce plug-ins and themes and all

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:48,130
the custom code is secure first is you

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,930
should check if you use any really old

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,540
plugins that haven't been updated in a

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,850
while and you can do that by going to

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,900
wordpress.org just search for the

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,790
plugins you have and if a plug-in hasn't

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,280
been updated in a couple of months or at

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:09,400
least a year try to find a replacement

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:13,060
or just deactivate that plug-in you can

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,730
also download a backup to your site open

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,860
that in a text editor to a search for

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:23,560
keywords like base64 or exact curl or

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,750
any of these keywords and see that shows

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,390
up in your files if that is your theme

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:32,470
or plugins are probably compromised with

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:35,320
some expections exceptions for curl but

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,940
if you find these in your theme you need

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,920
to restore that from a back up get a

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,310
different theme or install any updates

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:45,370
from the same provider if you have

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,440
access to WP CLI you can use this

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,950
command to see if the WordPress core

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,730
files are secure if they have not been

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:57,790
modified by any hackers and when you run

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,240
this command it will show output like

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:03,070
the first one if your site is clean if

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,650
any of the files are altered or modified

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:09,220
by attackers it will show you exactly

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:12,130
which files are not as per the checksum

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,610
and you can probably replace them from

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,920
the wordpress.org backup WordPress

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,920
download or you can just restore older

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,400
backup and try a manual update and this

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,840
is pretty effective in if you if you

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,400
think your site is hacked this is a

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,530
pretty good first come first step to

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
tech it will tell you exactly if

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,980
WordPress is modified or not it takes

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,480
two seconds to run and it's pretty

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,150
effective if you need to check your

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,330
themes and plugins for any security even

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,470
if you are not hacked but there's a

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,540
security exploit available for your

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,930
theme you can install this package

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,130
called WP sack run this command and it

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,400
will check all of your themes and

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,560
plugins for any known exploits so for

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,060
example D we had some issues two months

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,880
ago

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,460
plugins like ez WP SMTP related posts

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,240
all of them had one or two issues in the

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,390
past and you had to update them to keep

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,710
your site secure and it's easy if you

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,320
just follow the WordPress news all day

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,910
or read Twitter all day about these

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,860
issues but if you don't you can just

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,960
automate this command and it will send

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,140
you an alert if your if you are running

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,610
any plugins or themes that need to be

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,140
updated because of any security

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,940
incidents next thing you can do is

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,480
blocking hackers before they even reach

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,230
your site just like Amazon and you can

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,650
do that with a bunch of options

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:45,160
first is CloudFlare Amazon Web

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:47,620
Application Firewall tsukuri is a good

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,040
option they tailor their firewall

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:55,350
specific to WordPress and all of these

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:58,059
services use a lot of algorithms and

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,799
machine learning and

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:04,970
they have millions of sites hosted on

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,880
those platforms so when a type of attack

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,350
happens on one of the sites hosted on

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,080
these platforms they can update their

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,330
firewall rules to protect all other

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,940
sites so you are protected even if you

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,750
are not the target of hackers right away

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,750
and if they try to get to your site

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,299
few weeks later a few months later your

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,570
firewall will already have those rules

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:31,760
to block those attackers I like to

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,559
recommend CloudFlare because it's free

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,039
you get CDN

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,940
they have some good options and getting

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,230
started is pretty easy you just sign up

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,590
you see a page like this enter your

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,500
domain name update DNS and you're done

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,720
and then you need to make some changes

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,710
to make your site more secure like going

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,200
to crypt a tab and change the ssl status

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,240
to full this will encrypt the connection

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,130
between clouds layer and your servers

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:06,409
and it will force it to use TLS so even

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,070
in the even in transit no one will be

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:14,840
able to access your data next is enable

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,240
HSTs and if you do this this will

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,549
protect you against DNS hijacking

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,710
attacks so if someone is trying to

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,019
redirect your site for a specific user

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,389
to something else browser will show

00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:28,909
error like this instead of taking your

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,830
users to some captive site like I did

00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,090
did with Facebook in the past that

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,700
wouldn't work today because they use

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,190
HSTs you can enable this with one click

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,740
on your site and you will be protected

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:44,320
against someone creating a fake page

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:49,880
about your site in some certain cases

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:52,399
but this is a good start next is minimum

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,120
TLS version I recommend setting it to

00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:59,690
1.2 so it will not work on really old

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,289
phones or really old devices but at the

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,020
same time a lot of the hackers use

00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:08,149
scripts that are found from 2003 on

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,159
different forums they will use those to

00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,600
attack sites and those scripts will also

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,910
not work or any autumn

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,700
tools those will not be able to access

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,010
your site if you have Els requirements

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,260
set higher and this will also improve

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,179
performance of HTTP on your site and

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,260
again faster WooCommerce will make more

00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:29,000
money CloudFlare also had some

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,320
interesting options like this firewall

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,260
tab and you can block a bunch of bots if

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,419
your site gets a lot of bar traffic I

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,059
recommend blocking them from user agents

00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:43,370
or using services like this instead of

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:46,870
blocking and IP address because parts

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,870
will just change their IP and try again

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,740
now that your site is secure it's time

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,520
to plan for disasters and what happens

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,309
when there is a complete meltdown

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,919
because no matter what you do you can't

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:04,909
have 100% security you can do your best

00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:08,780
but it's ongoing process first step is

00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:12,470
backups and for a backup policy there

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,380
are three elements first one is

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,020
frequency

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:21,740
next is destination and finally

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:24,740
verification frequency is how frequently

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,020
your site is backed up and backup should

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,850
always be automated if you have to go in

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,770
and create backup that's just not going

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,299
to happen and you might end up with a

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,320
backup that was created six months ago

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:38,750
and that's not usable anymore most

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,990
hosting providers create a nightly

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,990
backup but depending on your transaction

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,539
volume how frequently new orders come in

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,809
or how frequently your staff is updating

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:52,309
inventory and others you can backup your

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:57,470
site more frequently like every four

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,390
hours or even every hour and to decide

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,539
if your frequency is good or not try

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:05,179
this take the most recent backup restore

00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:06,980
that on a staging site and see how long

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:08,840
it will take for you to manually fill

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,289
the orders or inventory or whatever

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,270
changes between that backup and now and

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,770
based on that you can decide how

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:21,490
frequently your site needs to be backed

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,490
up next is destination

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,990
and if you use a backup plug-in that

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,179
backs up on the same server that's not

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:34,309
really a backup because things happen

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:38,120
servers go offline or some hacks might

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:39,650
delete everything on your server and in

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,400
that case you want your backup to be

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:47,179
accessible and I recommend services like

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,059
Google Drive Amazon s3 Backblaze Dropbox

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:53,659
basically anything that's not from the

00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:56,510
same provider on the same location so if

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,149
something happens you always have access

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,159
to that backup

00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:04,130
finally verification making sure your

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,860
backup is usable and again you can do

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:10,190
that by taking a backup restoring it on

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,409
a staging site but when you restore you

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,200
need to check for few things like if

00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:17,120
there are the API keys for like premium

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,700
plugins are still in place after the

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,710
restore if the theme has all its

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,860
settings sometimes if you restore it on

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,630
staging you will miss like logo or fonts

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:32,840
or something and you need to manually

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:34,820
fix that and see once you restore that

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,649
make a list of all these things and see

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,470
what you need to do manually even after

00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:42,380
restoring that backup and so you will

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,960
know if the backup works and you will

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,500
have a policy in place of things to do

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,470
after you restore the backup again I

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,960
also like to time it how long it will

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,690
take because you're already panicking

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,539
but you have to restore backup and in

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,470
that you have to follow these steps and

00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:04,010
restoring backup always takes longer

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,429
than you would think so what do you need

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,870
to do in that 2 or 3 hours it takes to

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,909
restore that backup get your sight back

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,490
online at the same time fielding calls

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:16,539
from your customers or your boss or any

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:22,010
co-workers hey site is not working so

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:24,860
having a good policy is step 1 or you

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:28,220
can also I shouldn't say or you should

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,530
also have a warm standby a warrant

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,840
standby is a copy of your site that's up

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,909
to date within 2 or 3 hours depending on

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:41,809
how you set it up

00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:44,269
and setting it up is pretty easy you

00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:46,580
should just sign up with another hosting

00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,419
provider not the same company go with

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,099
another provider get an entry-level plan

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,649
sign up with the same domain name as you

00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,179
have on your production site and again

00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:58,639
it doesn't have to be an expensive plan

00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:02,149
it's just for a couple of hours if your

00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:04,239
site goes offline but it will give you a

00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:07,309
good backup option so you sign up with

00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:13,129
same domain name do not point your dns

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:16,129
to that server just leave it there then

00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:21,710
install the WP migrate TB premium plugin

00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:22,940
with WP CLI option and you need to set

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,070
it up like this enable the pool

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,039
operation you can go to WP admin

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,369
settings and enable that it will also

00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,999
show you the API key required for the

00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:36,799
next step

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:39,619
note it down and go to the control panel

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,950
of your hosting provider the new one set

00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:47,690
up a cron like this and what this will

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:49,429
do is it will go to your live site copy

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,460
the database all the media updates

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:54,919
orders inventory everything restore that

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,009
on the cheaper hosting plan that you

00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,859
have and you can set it to run every two

00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,109
hours or three hours so it will go it

00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:06,349
will have that site as close as possible

00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,539
to your live site and you can use that

00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:11,149
in event something goes wrong or if your

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:14,570
host is offline because of any number of

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:17,450
reasons even Amazon and Google and as or

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:20,509
have outages that last couple of hours

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:24,799
if not days so in that situation you can

00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:26,389
get back online with some steps it's a

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,200
bit complicated procedure so bear with

00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:33,830
me now when you need to use this warm

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,080
standby first thing you need to do is go

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,369
to your DNS control panel so it might be

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,659
good addy CloudFlare update the DNS to

00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:47,730
point to this new hosting provider and

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:51,370
you're done you're back online

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,350
and it takes depending on how you set it

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,540
up it will take you 60 seconds to go

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,430
from the complete outage to certainly

00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,910
you're back in business with some

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,350
exceptions your site will be up to date

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,990
within the last two hours you can always

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,520
backfill that using backups but this

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,270
will not keep you offline in for days

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,460
and days and this will cost you maybe

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,010
$10 a month so if you're running

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,730
importantly enough store this is a good

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,220
starting point

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,960
after that you can if when you grow

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,030
enough you can look at high availability

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:27,940
solutions and other options finally here

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:30,250
are some resources I highly recommend

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:35,470
the first one go there and check if your

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:39,640
passwords are on any of the leaks or any

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,680
of the lists other ones are good

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,050
resources for security last one is my

00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,090
blog we also write about full commerce

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:52,330
security in there so do check us out and

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:55,240
if you run Facebook ads on veau commerce

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,760
I would like to talk to you ask you some

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,530
questions I have some ideas that will

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,770
help you make more money and I'll be

00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:05,839
here all weekend thank you

00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,839
[Applause]

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,800
thank you very much for giving that

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,390
critical information I know it's pretty

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,030
valuable to anyone who runs a business

00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:18,540
on top of WooCommerce we have about ten

00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:20,610
minutes here about 15 minutes for any

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,990
questions you might have for hold on if

00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,370
you do have a question I would ask if

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,510
you could repeat the question just so

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:37,710
they can hear and yeah questions anyone

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:40,800
yeah do you have any experience so the

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,960
question was do you have any positive or

00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,750
negative experience with less let's

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,050
encrypt so yeah it's used pretty widely

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:52,620
and high I highly recommend it it's just

00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,910
like any other SSL provider and I don't

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,360
think I have had any negative

00:30:53,910 --> 00:31:00,510
experiences sometimes it takes longer to

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,760
validate the DNS and to issue but that's

00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:11,670
mostly the user error and not something

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:14,640
on their side yes I used let's encrypt

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:17,580
on twelve thousand sites auto-renewal

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,740
works pretty fine again if it doesn't

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,350
auto renew for you it's usually how you

00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:29,480
set it up but if you set it up correctly

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:29,480
there shouldn't be any issues yes sir

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:39,789
so the difference between MaxCDN and

00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:43,479
CloudFlare MaxCDN is good but they

00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:46,419
mostly have they're good for like

00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:48,369
accelerating static assets CloudFlare is

00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:51,159
much more than a CDN these days you can

00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:53,769
do things like the security and stuff

00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,869
rate limits they have good firewall you

00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:57,820
can block certain countries you can

00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:01,599
probably do that with MaxCDN as well but

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:04,329
CloudFlare has a lot more security

00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:27,699
options that you can configure compared

00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:29,349
to the other one so the question is what

00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:32,289
happens if you migrate to the warm

00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,389
standby does it also seem backwards to

00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:37,949
the hosting provider that you originally

00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:42,879
used so no it will not it's a one-way

00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:45,429
replication and so this is this gets

00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:47,649
tricky because when you switch to a warm

00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,659
standby and then you have to switch back

00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:52,809
to the hosting provider at that stage

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:55,149
what you can do is put your store on the

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,619
warm standby in maintenance mode create

00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:58,749
a backup and restore that on the

00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:01,479
original hosting provider it's a bit of

00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:03,879
a process but again you get back online

00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:06,659
in 60 seconds compared to having to be

00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,659
offline for a day

00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:52,510
so the question is does it help secure

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,190
WordPress more if you have WordPress

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:58,630
files in a different directory like app

00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:02,920
and different web root and plugins or WP

00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:06,820
content in other directories so it will

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:10,330
work with dumb hackers but the primary

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:14,200
benefit of data structure is if you use

00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:16,270
git or any version control it will not

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,400
commit the WordPress core files in your

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:24,070
git repository so only your custom code

00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:27,610
gets in the git repository and I mean

00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,980
it's it doesn't have many security

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,720
benefits but for development it's good

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,420
that you don't every time WordPress

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,880
updates you don't have to update or

00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:43,960
commit 200 files to your git repository

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:46,389
in half all those changes show up all

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:52,649
right thanks everyone for coming

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,649
