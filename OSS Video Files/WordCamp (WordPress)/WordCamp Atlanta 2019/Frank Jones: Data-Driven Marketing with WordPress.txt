more information and guidance so i've

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,420
got some quick questions for you all

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,890
this is where you're gonna need that

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,590
note-taking device so you can answer

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,450
these questions what do you want people

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,159
to do when they come to your website

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,409
take a few seconds jot down whatever

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,619
that number one thing is that you want

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,350
people to do and then if anybody wants

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,049
to holo-room out we can share a couple

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,530
of them real quick anybody want to share

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,530
with the crowd

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:09,700
okay you wanted to follow your website

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,080
wanted to buy something do you have an

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:18,959
e-commerce site energy manufacturing

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,959
okay so they actually buy on the website

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,549
okay so there may be a multiple step

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:32,290
process there who else I answer a call

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,700
to action okay so you're taking the

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,120
content marketing stuff around here

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:42,599
after zoom who else just throw some out

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:47,980
make an appointment engage okay next one

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,390
why do you want people to do that there

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,190
we go now we're getting somewhere

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,549
so follow the website so that way you'll

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,590
get paid so there's actually something

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,290
else that you want people to do follow

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,420
the website is the backup option depends

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,639
on your business model you want to

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:14,920
return yeah anybody else want to throw

00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:16,269
one out why you want them to do that so

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
that's what to do why do you want them

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,480
to do that

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,150
all right and how does this impact the

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,830
bottom line of your business this is

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,040
what all of this is getting to often

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,810
times I hear from potential clients that

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,270
they want more followers on Facebook as

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,610
an example last time I checked you can't

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,980
pay your rent with Facebook followers so

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,420
it all gets down to how does this impact

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,640
the bottom line of your business and

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,620
being clear on how you're building that

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,310
model and how you're optimizing towards

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,989
that goal so we're gonna measure success

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,830
in order to figure out where we're going

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,900
with this quick little example to show

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,510
you what a dashboard should look like if

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,280
you're measuring some goals you can see

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,290
the light blue line this is organic

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,510
search referrals so you can see spikes

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,280
and dips as people are coming in off of

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,050
search engine optimization into this

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,239
site this is just some dummy data

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,890
measured in single dollar values I hope

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,150
nobody's excited about earning six

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,400
dollars but it's some an example to show

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,700
you without having to violate anybody's

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,620
privacy on the sites that I'm managing

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,840
direct tie ping you've got the Green

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,210
Line there so that's if somebody gets

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,270
your URL goes directly to the site types

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,620
it right into the browser depending on

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,300
the different types of marketing

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,100
campaigns that you're doing you would

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,020
expect different movements in these

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,120
lines so if you've just done a mailing

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,610
campaign where you've sent a piece of

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,650
actual physical mail to your target

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,990
clients you would expect to see a bump

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,610
in direct typing coming into your

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,150
website if that campaign was successful

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,260
if you just did push with some content

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,440
somebody out here was talking about

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,390
calls to action so content marketing and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,880
you've got that content to rank in

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,890
Google ranking is great but if you've

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,750
got no traffic coming in off of that it

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,090
doesn't matter so you would expect to

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,220
see some movement in these organic

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,229
search referrals and this particular

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,640
graph is measuring goal completions so

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,990
if we get a hundred people to come to

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,970
the website because they found some

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,950
content in Google and they don't do

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,740
anything those hundred people are worth

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:30,430
exactly zero to that business we got to

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,110
have people actually doing something so

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,060
some common goals

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,830
most of you guys we got a few examples

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,449
of business models I think just about

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,629
everybody fits into one of these five

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,129
categories here so real quick does

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,719
anybody have a business model that

00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:51,539
they're working that doesn't fit in one

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:53,460
of these no all right so we're gonna

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,680
connect business models with some goals

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,750
on the other side ecommerce just shout

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,310
it out what's the goal of e-commerce oh

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,780
that's an easy one if you have a

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,430
subscription business model what's the

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:12,659
goal on the other side subscribers

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,490
membership site lead generation all

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:17,490
right you guys kind of have where this

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,840
is going this is where you can get into

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,400
those different pieces and that

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,229
multi-tiered funnel that you're putting

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,669
together where you have people subscribe

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,050
to a mailing list and then eventually

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,879
you're going to sell them a product or

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,310
service I think those automotive

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,860
equipment or was that right engines so

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,840
you may have social media followers and

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,310
subscribers on mailing lists but

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,719
ultimately you want to get them over to

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,479
something where they're buying a product

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:41,430
or service and you can do some backwards

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,440
math to be able to figure out how much

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,830
is one more subscriber on my mailing

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,629
list worth this connects goals to key

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,400
performance indicators to return on

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,169
investment one of the things that we

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,539
always get asked for those of us that

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,000
are digital marketing professionals is

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,310
how can you demonstrate the return on my

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,349
investment here if I give you $1,000 for

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,490
this marketing campaign how are you

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,439
going to show me that you're putting

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,029
money back in my bank account and in

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,830
order to do that you've got to work out

00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,879
what is the value of another social

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,680
media follower if that's what we're

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,219
doing what is the value of another email

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,699
subscriber and it's a rough estimate and

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:19,620
it helps you to determine how good of a

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,180
job you're doing connecting with your

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,710
ideal audience in some of the other

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,669
sessions here you've heard people talk

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,740
about speaking to your ideal audience

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,770
the better you do at speaking to that

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,689
exact audience the lower your cost will

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,849
be per conversion and the higher your

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,830
profits will be per conversion so by

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,020
measuring those things down to the per

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,639
conversion level you can see those last

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,229
thousand people that we brought into our

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,670
email list when we sent them out that

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,190
campaign and they only converted

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,580
at 10% and normally we've been

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,720
converting at 30% those last thousand

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,520
people that we just brought in or not

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
our ideal customers how can we tweak

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,620
that campaign to speak to our ideal

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,620
customers

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:06,430
so from goals being sales subscriptions

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,890
memberships leads and influence we can

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,660
get the key performance indicator

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,340
ecommerce is a little bit easier for

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,050
measuring some of these things out

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,360
because the transaction happens right on

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,130
the site

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,930
not everybody has as easy a time as

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,000
measuring these things ecommerce has its

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,650
own set of challenges

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,180
measuring the performance of their

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,770
campaigns is not one of those that's a

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,300
lot easier for them subscribers members

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,040
subscribers calls emails for leads

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,240
depends on what type of leads those are

00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,590
coming in I was speaking with somebody

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,100
out in the hall about using call

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,540
tracking so using that data to be able

00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,220
to capture how many leads you have

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,990
coming in and then how many of those

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,220
leads actually convert depending on

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,510
where they're coming from with that key

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,120
performance indicator you can then

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,720
calculate an ROI with sales you can go

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,160
directly to money I Acamas having it a

00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,170
little bit easier their subscribers

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,670
sales through messaging so if you have a

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,550
thousand people that are subscribed to

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,820
your mailing list and you send them a

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,140
message about a sponsor's product or an

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,280
affiliate link or something of that

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,610
nature that's where you're gonna

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,110
capitalize on that audience or message

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,140
about an event that you're having or

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,020
however you're selling something to that

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,640
mailing list over time as your mailing

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,200
list grows you can measure those

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
conversion rates you can also measure

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,680
the conversion rates for specific

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,600
products and be able to determine is

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,930
that product resonating with my audience

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,480
based on how likely they are to buy it

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,160
or is my audience changing over time

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,570
based on how they respond to an offer

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,880
that I've made previously with a

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,830
different set of my audience with

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,980
members sales have paid membership dues

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,410
I output of sales funnels with

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,530
subscribers and sponsorships and ad

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,880
revenues a lot of businesses yours maybe

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,070
you were talking about getting people to

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,180
come and look at your website that could

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,850
be a business model that is

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,970
monetized through sponsorships or ads

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,009
along the sides so you're actually

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,110
wanting to optimize for people to click

00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:10,370
on those ads you want to get them to

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,069
come to the website and you want to get

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,720
them to keep coming back but ultimately

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:18,290
you want them to click on an ad and go

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,550
away and that's how you earn money and I

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,629
don't know if that's specifically yours

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,149
but you're nodding your head so I'm

00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:28,490
going to go along with it I'm right

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:30,050
close okay yeah a lot of times it's a

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,639
good idea to layer multiple different

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,139
business models so you may have one

00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,120
business model where you're getting

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,410
people to view and click on ads but then

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,029
you have another piece where you get

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,129
them to subscribe to your email list and

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:42,319
you make different offers through that

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:46,040
email list so you have multiple pieces

00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:49,790
that create a virtuous cycle so here's

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,829
how we can calculate the ROI of various

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,809
KPI I'm having fun with these letters

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:57,050
everybody before you walked into this

00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:59,269
room where you familiar with KPI alright

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,470
anybody still at this point lost and

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,129
doesn't know what I'm talking about with

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,230
KPI all right I was just about to say if

00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,089
anybody's embarrassed I'm just playing

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,009
it anyway

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:12,350
alright so KPI is key performance

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,939
indicators these are the numbers that we

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,389
can actually measure in order to get an

00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,350
idea of whether or not our business is

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:22,339
succeeding at the objectives that we

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,350
want ROI is return on investment so if

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,759
somebody comes to you as a marketing

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,410
campaign and says hey you give me a

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,209
thousand dollars I'm gonna do this

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,519
marketing thing and I'm gonna get you

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:33,019
sales on the other side you want to see

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,939
for that thousand dollars that you spent

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,410
on advertising you got five thousand

00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:38,300
dollars that came in and sales you

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,829
subtract your costs you're still ahead

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,879
hopefully it depends on your margins

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:43,670
we're not going to get into all that

00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,769
math but if you need help with this talk

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,779
with an accountant and they'll help

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,259
break down some of these numbers for you

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:53,809
and then KPI is where you can measure

00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:56,800
things like subscribers to an email

00:11:53,809 --> 00:12:01,699
lists that are not directly related to a

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,929
revenue number so if we have profit from

00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:07,699
sales that ecommerce business model

00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:09,230
that's a direct relationship whatever

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:11,269
profit you got from that sale that's

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,010
your return on investment email

00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,930
subscribers multiplied by a

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,700
conversion rates so if only 10% of your

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,980
email subscribers buy a thing and you

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,070
have a hundred email subscribers you can

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,930
expect to sell ten things multiplied by

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,240
the profit for each of those things that

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,740
you sell if you make $100 on each of the

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,940
things that you sell and you sell ten of

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,930
them you made a thousand bucks by

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,820
sending out an email

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,250
not bad for clicking the send button

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,090
right but you had a lot of work to build

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,040
that email list members lifetime average

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,150
lifetime value this is a important

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,430
distinction that a lot of people

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,320
overlook if you have a membership site

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,820
and you spend five hundred dollars to

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,880
get somebody to join your membership

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,400
site that costs $49 a month first month

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,840
that sounds pretty stupid spending $500

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,670
to get someone to give you 50 bucks a

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,100
month you're losing money but if they

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,900
spend the next 10 years on that

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,970
membership site paying $50 a month and

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,430
you only spent $500 to get them in there

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,900
that's worth every penny so you got to

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,900
have an idea of how long are people

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,700
going to stay on your membership site as

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,650
we get further down we've got some

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,130
lifetime value kind of numbers as well

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,380
so subscribing to your email list if you

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,230
have an educational Bend to your site

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,930
you may expect that within three years

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,160
somebody's going to go from being novice

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,200
at whatever it is that you're teaching

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,460
them to being an expert and move out of

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,630
your mailing list because they already

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,670
learned everything that you have to

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,780
share that might be the lifetime value

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,470
of somebody being on your email

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,460
subscription list you can use some of

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,350
these numbers to be able to work

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,780
backwards and figure out how much can I

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,000
afford to pay for an ad to get a new

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,910
person to get a new subscriber to get

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,590
more visitors to my site so I wanted to

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,110
make this a little bit more concrete and

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,840
lay out a little mathematical problem

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,160
here to explain it to you so we have a

00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,320
course that sells for one hundred and

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,240
fifty dollars ten percent of the people

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,360
that receive the email will buy that

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,200
course 50 percent of the social

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,970
followers become email subscribers and

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,300
one percent of the website visitors

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,850
become email subscribers so that math

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,980
then works out that each and every sale

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,350
brings in a hundred dollars in profit we

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,970
can expect to get ten dollars in profit

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,100
from each person that subscribes to our

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,650
email list so if it costs us less than

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,270
$10 to get a new email subscriber we

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,750
want to keep doing that if it costs more

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,550
than ten

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,060
to get a new email subscriber we stopped

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,130
doing that $5 expected profit for each

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,690
social follower and ten cents expected

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,450
profit for each new visitor to the

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,650
website so if you're only making 10

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,480
cents for each new visitor to the

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,790
website and you can do some SEO content

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,460
and bring in another thousand visitors

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,780
to your website I didn't do the math in

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,730
advance and I should have backed myself

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,800
into a corner there ten cents times a

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,330
thousand anybody real quick wanna throw

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,470
out the number 100 bucks alright so you

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,670
can spend a hundred bucks on that piece

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,630
of content thank you yes standing in

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,520
front of an audience

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:11,840
math becomes difficult technical

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,420
challenges so Google estimates that at

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,120
blacklist ten thousand websites daily I

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,600
heard another talk that was this morning

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,130
about WooCommerce security and they were

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,650
talking about how by showing the little

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,480
lock in the top of the browser that this

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,700
site is not secure that has a

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,960
significant impact on conversion rates

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,540
for e-commerce websites

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,640
well imagine when it shows up in Google

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,660
search results and it says right

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,060
underneath that this site is not I I

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,710
secure and then if that message sticks

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,630
around for any length of time Google

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,770
says okay you guys are in a serious

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,120
business anymore we're just going to

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,170
take you out at Google and completely

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,700
they're pulling 10,000 sites a day

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,630
because security is not being addressed

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:02,450
properly so you can avoid that by having

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:05,780
strong passwords doing backups we all

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,270
know this right back up your site avoid

00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,540
excessive customizations what was the

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,880
number from the trivia yesterday 55,000

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,060
or 65,000 plugins are available on

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,820
WordPress some ridiculous number like

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,500
that I I think all of us that build

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,000
WordPress websites and manage them for

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,300
other people have probably seen folks

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,310
that try to install all of them that's a

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,050
really good way to end up with problems

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,430
on your website just because there is a

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,209
plug-in doesn't mean it needs to be

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:39,140
installed I use strong passwords this

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,400
may surprise you but in 2018 only six or

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,440
eight months ago

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,600
I got contacted by a client that said

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,560
hey my websites down it's been hacked

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,060
what's going on

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,640
I said hey give me the login information

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,500
I'll take a look they call it out to me

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:58,570
the login password was PA SS wo Rd one

00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:02,750
two three and I said I found the problem

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,080
so that's just 2018 I didn't think that

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:09,170
I still had to say this but we do

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,750
password is not a valid password I use

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,740
strong passwords if you don't know what

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,270
that is google it

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,940
there are countless articles written

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,130
about defining strong passwords do not

00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,780
share accounts I run into this still a

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,339
lot where you have one account and

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,410
everybody in the organization uses the

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,620
same login everybody doesn't have to be

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,750
an admin and do install updates I

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,880
grabbed this screenshot show hands

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,180
anybody seen a number larger than 22

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:56,120
updates that needed to be done

00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:59,740
few of them all right three companies

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,740
five sites but you want

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:10,889
okay are you running WordPress

00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:13,559
multi-site okay yeah so the question was

00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:16,559
asking about being able to give access

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,090
to only one site and immediately I was

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
thinking you must be running WordPress

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,380
multi-site because if you had five

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,519
separate installations of WordPress this

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,929
wouldn't even really come up as a

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,799
question cuz they'd each have separate

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:30,990
users it has been a lot of years since I

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
have set up a wordpress multi-site site

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,210
so I don't know if things have changed

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,309
but I presume that you can set an admin

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,840
for an individual WordPress multi so I'm

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:46,860
getting a nod in the back so it sounds

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:48,330
like I'm right yeah yeah so super user

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:56,000
gets access to everything within the

00:18:48,330 --> 00:19:00,240
multi-site yeah all right

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,980
so quick show of hands who here has a

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,649
wordpress website that is not backed up

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,840
we'll admit it all right there's a

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,909
couple people that that's the acquit

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,340
okay this is an important one thank you

00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,110
for reminding me if your website is

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,789
backed up and you do not know how to

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,179
restore your website from the backup

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:24,240
your website is not backed up now who

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:28,049
wants to raise their hand all right we

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,509
got a few more so zina ZDNet did a

00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:34,259
survey and this is not specific to

00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:36,480
WordPress websites but 39% of us

00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,970
participants surveyed never back up

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,070
their work given that that's never back

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,539
up their work on their computer and then

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,450
we're talking about WordPress it

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,679
probably is similar and since only three

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,970
people in the room we're willing to

00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,330
raise their hand there's a few liars

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,330
here

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,370
all right where it can you find support

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,379
this is what you have to know to be a

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,450
wordpress developer probably a few more

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:05,600
things but show of hands who knows all

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,970
the things on the board there all right

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,720
not knows the words knows how to do

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,970
those things okay so about a third of

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,070
the room not bad for a word camp

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,390
conference so if you don't know these

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,700
things you're probably going to have

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,690
questions about at least these or

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:27,080
probably a lot more things as well

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,990
meetups conferences and the internet are

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,610
good places to go look for help I gave

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,880
you a little short list of places to

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,580
start your WordPress dashboard has an

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,700
event section and it lists things that

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,860
are on the meetup sites right there in

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,540
your dashboard so you can recognize

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,780
those the WordPress help desk that I do

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,850
gets a ton of people that said oh I was

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,230
just working on my website and I noticed

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,630
this event it's right around the corner

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,340
I signed up so that's a great place to

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,700
start from there you can go to meetup

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,740
directly because the dashboard only

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,250
pulls in the ones that are official

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:07,190
WordPress meetup events and there are a

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,380
lot of unofficial WordPress meetup

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,780
events so go to meetup.com type in

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,520
WordPress see what's in your area word

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,950
camp I think everybody here has heard of

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,810
that before I make dot wordpress.org

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,880
this is a great place to figure out the

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,050
people that are making WordPress what

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,900
different groups there are that are

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:30,770
doing that and how you can connect with

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,840
them I show of hands who here knows

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,670
before I'm saying it right now that

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,710
there is a group of people that are

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,080
actually building lesson plans for you

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,660
to be able to teach WordPress that are

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,500
part of the contributor group for

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:48,800
WordPress one person all right so that's

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,070
news for everyone there are a variety of

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,500
support channels there's I one of my

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,530
favorites the next one here codex dot

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,360
wordpress.org anybody been to that a few

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:03,710
more people have been to that so that's

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,150
kind of like the it can be it can

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,090
definitely be confusing if you're

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,490
completely new to WordPress the codex

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,030
can definitely be confusing however if

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,160
you are a developer trying to learn how

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,140
to create plugins and themes and such

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,539
that's a great place to go one of my

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,149
favorite things in the code

00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:25,869
that I regularly send people to is the

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:27,039
article on child themes as you start

00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:28,389
building out your website and you're

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,700
trying to figure out what is a child

00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:33,369
theme how does this work the codex has a

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,289
wonderful resource on that and it walks

00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:38,200
you through the manual process of

00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:40,809
creating a child theme I look at it the

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,450
same way that my statistics professor in

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,039
college looked at matrix algebra they

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,139
felt that you should probably do this

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,899
once by hand in order to appreciate what

00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:52,200
the calculator is doing and so I always

00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:55,869
recommend to folks to go and build a

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,379
child theme once by hand in order to

00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:01,389
appreciate what the plug-in that you can

00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,739
click one button and it creates your

00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:05,499
child theme for you what it's actually

00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:07,899
doing now the reason for that is that as

00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:10,929
you continue to build things with your

00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:12,820
child theme you're going to want to know

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,499
where that code is supposed to go what

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,389
files are supposed to be where and by

00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:18,909
having done it once manually you'll

00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:21,159
understand that better that's a bit of a

00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:23,139
tangent but bottom line go take a look

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,809
at make dot WordPress or take a look at

00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:28,239
Codex wordpress.org see what resources

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,919
are available there if it if only

00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:32,289
because you'll be able to know what to

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,269
come back to and then WordPress dot TV

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:37,929
which is where that video is going and

00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,679
what are you gonna do with this

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,509
information

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,909
I mentioned having some paper out or

00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:46,779
some sort of note-taking device I

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,279
everybody that's been to conferences

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,559
before knows that this happens all the

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:53,409
time you come to an event you spend all

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,779
day learning from people you leave here

00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,580
super jazzed and excited to do all the

00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:59,320
things that you just learned about two

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,340
days later you're busy with work and you

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,190
don't have time for this

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,159
and all of that stuff that you are super

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:09,159
excited about nothing happens this talk

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,779
is not going to be one of those if you

00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,840
make an accountability appointment with

00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:15,249
a person to whom you've committed the

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,009
likelihood of you completing that task

00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:19,989
goes up to 95% so you're almost

00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:22,059
certainly going to get something done if

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:23,379
you commit to doing it tell someone to

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,549
do it that you're going to do it and

00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:28,509
make an appointment to follow up here's

00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,889
what I want you to do for your

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:33,009
accountability partner with that

00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,430
note-taking device now that you know all

00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,630
of this

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:38,560
information that I just shared with you

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:41,740
what tasks will you be completing make

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,520

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:48,010
will this be done set a specific date

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,570

WYSIWYG what you see is what you get

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,940
easy way to build those things however

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:51,210
you can also build those things with a

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,140
variety of page builders Elementor I

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,700
know is talked about here I know that

00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,750
thrive themes I've used many times

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,809
before

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,179
WP Bakery several folks have talked

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,510
about here and that's just three off the

00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,299
top of my head

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,770
essentially what leadpages and services

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,480
like that are doing is creating a

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,669
specific type of page called a squeeze

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,250
page and all that you need to do within

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,570
WordPress is create a blank page that

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,429
doesn't have your header or your footer

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,520
and then build the rest of that page

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,960
around there there's tools within

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,760
WordPress that allow you to do that

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,110
without having to pay that ongoing

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,230
monthly fee so it depends on whether you

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,179
need the ease of use or the lower cost

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:42,660
but you can solve the problem in

00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:44,299
multiple ways on WordPress any of the

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,080
page builders will allow you to do that

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:48,929
Elementor was one of the ones that I

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:56,280
mentioned thrive themes WP bakery

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:58,710
anybody else know a Divi Divi yeah yeah

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,049
squeeze page is a particular type of

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,000
landing page where essentially people

00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,140
have two choices they can either do what

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,690
is that you're asking them to do the

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,880
call-to-action or they can leave they

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,500
can't get lost in the blog or link out

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,450
to your social media channels and never

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,130
come back from Facebook they can either

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,170
do what it is that you're asking to do

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,910
buy the product subscribe for the email

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,620
list whatever or they can click their

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,960
back button go do something else

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,920
so it's squit you're squeezing them to

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,920
do something yes

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,250
I'm sorry I

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,840
so is this only supposed to be about

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,660
Facebook or anything else so the way

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,220
that this connects with Facebook is that

00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,050
you might have followers that are paying

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,840
attention to your business on Facebook

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,860
that then come over to your website and

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,750
interact with your business in some way

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,870
but they could come from anywhere so it

00:28:51,750 --> 00:29:03,900
could be more than just Facebook all

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:06,240
right OPS's so I have been working in

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,160
conversion rate optimization so that's

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,530
me personally working with a variety of

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,260
clients with that with OPS's I'm making

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,380
the transition away from being frank

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,330
that does work and become a business

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,820
that has a team of people that solves a

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,710
collection of problems so Ops is

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,900
focusing on WordPress management and

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,700
building simple WordPress websites as a

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,310
way to start having a conversation with

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:42,930
clients and move into more advanced

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:46,740
marketing services Yoast is the one that

00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,650
I use on most of my sites sorry

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:54,600
I keep forgetting to repeat it I the

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:57,930
question was is Yoast favored framework

00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:02,340
or are others preferred given that Yoast

00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:04,200
can slow things down a little bit so the

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,290
first piece I use Yoast on most of my

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,360
sites that being said I am also

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,770
tinkering with rank math there's one

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,650
that I have on one of my sites that I'm

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:16,590
exploring with right now just to see how

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,920
that works out I the green light system

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,540
I

00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,930
also organized the Raleigh SEO meetup

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,460
group so I use a variety of tools for

00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,400
search engine optimization that go

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,140
beyond just Yoast as a starter tool it's

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,330
really easy to sit somebody down and say

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,480
make all the lights green so that's a

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,250
huge feature for beginners but aside

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,600
from editing meta titles and

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,130
descriptions I don't use most of the

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,220
other features that are baked into Yoast

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,740
as far as the optimization piece goes if

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,780
you properly optimize WordPress the

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:50,940
plugins don't bloat it as much I run my

00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,090
sites on my own VPS servers that are

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,990
optimized the way that I want them and I

00:30:53,090 --> 00:31:00,840
I can make them load fairly quickly i

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:02,610
but if you're using a 5 or $10 a month

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,040
hosting provider you're gonna run into

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,840
some challenges there anyway and I

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,120
always like to recommend the right

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,920
solution for the right stage of business

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
if you're new and you're just beginning

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,530
you don't need to deal with any of those

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,510
optimization things that I'm talking

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,250
about just stickiest in there make the

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,410
lights green and prove your business

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,910
model once you've moved beyond that then

00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:32,490
we can optimize further with other

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:39,210
things anybody else yes sir so there are

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:42,870
a variety of a B testing I what a/b

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,940
testing tools do I use with the clients

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,480
that I've worked with I've used a few

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,490
different AV testing tools often times

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,460
thrive themes has some split testing

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,220
tools that are plug-ins that I've used

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,300
with them a couple of others that the

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,600
names aren't coming to mind right now

00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,070
but most of the time we're dealing with

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,890
what I like to refer to as business

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,990
level statistics not academic level

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,130
statistics if you're in academic and

00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,420
you're looking at the math that we're

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,150
doing here you're gonna just laugh

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,670
because we don't have anywhere near

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,590
statistical relevance but if I run an ad

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,690
campaign and I've got two different

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,700
Facebook ads they've both been shown to

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,410
a hundred people one of them has gotten

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,720
me 50 clicks the other one's gotten me

00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,280
two clicks I don't need any software to

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,260
tell me to turn off the one that got me

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,480
two clicks and keep going with the one

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,080
that got me 50 clicks right presuming

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,140
clicks or the

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,380
after as opposed to conversions if we

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,630
are measuring conversions just to twist

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,059
that example a little bit if those two

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,980
clicks both turned into a sale and the

00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,360
50 people that clicked on the ad nobody

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,070
bought anything I'm actually going to

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,419
turn off the one that got 50 clicks and

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,549
stick with the one that got two clicks

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:53,640
that actually bought something does that

00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,830
make sense so it's it's a matter a lot

00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,149
of it is very basic level math that you

00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,950
don't need software to do the heavy

00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:01,710
lifting you just need to set up an

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,289
experiment where you have test a and

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,950
test B and then let it run to where you

00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:09,510
have at least 50 or a hundred or so it

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,519
depends on your market for some people a

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,720
hundred people might actually take weeks

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,769
to get there for other people it might

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,899
be hours so there's a lot of variables

00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:21,720
there does that make sense

00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:26,120
sufficiently answer okay any other

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,120
questions all right

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,680
