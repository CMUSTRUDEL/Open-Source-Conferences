over to Birmingham it's a great camp a

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,140
lot smaller than this but I think the

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,579
content is excellent so I am the host at

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,770

tell people looks like being at WordCamp

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,930
all year long virtually everything we do

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,460
is free we do two or three live webinars

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,739
a week that are just like the word camp

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,300
talks a matter of fact I did 19 word

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,370
camps last year and one of the things I

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,840
did was cherry-pick the best speakers

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,579
from the word camps across the country

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,500
and bring them on to do live webinars

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,989
when I think's training so check us out

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,059
there at training I think calm I'm also

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,250
an ambassador for the liquid web Partner

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,890
Program both I things in liquid web make

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,170
it possible for me to be here I am a web

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,760
business owner had been since 1995 I've

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,990
been building web sites since the

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,090
internet just first started to walk

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,470
upright that's when I built and sold my

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,909
first project way back then

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,530
and for a little over five years now

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,810
I've been a business coach for WordPress

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,250
freelancers it's a it's a passion of

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,409
mine actually my first coaching client

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,799
is sitting right there mr. de Bron good

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,200
to have him over here so I mentioned the

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,680
book yes so let's do this when it comes

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,439
to productivity I'm an expert at least

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,770
by the definition of dr. Niels Bohr who

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,720
said an expert is a person who has by

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,310
his own painful experience found out all

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,100
the mistakes that one can make in a very

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,860
narrow field so by that definition I'm

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,479
absolutely an expert it's funny this

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,939
talk actually gave last weekend at work

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,860
camp Orange County as well and this

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,380
issue right here of productivity has

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,869
been the one that has kicked my butt for

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,189
the first quarter of this year I think

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,340
it's ironic that I'm giving this talk

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,170
twice within a week so I'm you know I

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,149
share that with you to say look this is

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,489
a struggle it's a real struggle how many

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,120
of you struggle being productive in your

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,390
business so we come to word camps and we

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,340
learned some great things and here

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,960
I have to tell you you are not alone how

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,190
many of you work with clients that is

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,080
your thing you're doing something work

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,810
with WordPress and clients excellent

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,810
so how many of you have it all together

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,820
one person yes Michelle you should get

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,590
to know Michelle on the back she's got a

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,290
talk later called how to have it all

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,670
together in your WordPress business so

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,110
here's the challenge when you come to a

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,000
group like this and you meet a lot of

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,980
great people they all seem like they're

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,870
doing great they have this great persona

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,100
that they're exhibiting and you look at

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,020
them and you think they don't have the

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,970
problems I have they don't deal with

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,770
problem clients they don't struggle with

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,880
revenue that does like this they don't

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,560
struggle with being productive

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,600
personally they've got everything

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,540
together and what I've learned is that

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,209
that is garbage we all face the same

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,209
challenges in five years of coaching

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,830
freelancers hundreds of conversations

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,780
with freelancers male and female across

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,489
the United States and Canada around the

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,400
world I have discovered that there are

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,100
no unique issues or at least very few

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,320
unique issues now the details may be a

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,980
little different but the core issues are

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,950
the same many people in the WordPress

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,989
space are one more bad client away from

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,090
calling it quits they're one more bad

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,549
month away from throwing in the towel

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,690
it's a shame because most of these

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:36,880
frustrations are fixable by good systems

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,860
and processes including some of the

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,420
personal productivity habits that I'm

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,060
going to talk about today by the way if

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,769
you are struggling if you've come to

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,780
this word camp and in a room that with

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,220
as many people in it chances are they're

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,769
at least a few of you who have come to

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,760
this word camp as a lifeline and you're

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,290
thinking I don't know if I'm gonna be

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,540
able to continue this I don't know

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,799
I'm tired of the struggles with clients

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,850
I'm tired of the revenue going up and

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,820
down I'm tired of all these things

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,940
listen I say that's very very sincerely

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,320
I am here for you this weekend I've come

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,540
to these word camps to spend time with

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,940
you to help you fix these problems

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,950
because I am a passionate advocate of

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,930
owning your own business being in

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,030
control of your own destiny and using

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,859
the wonderful tool of WordPress to

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,620
empower whatever the priorities you have

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,120
set for your life okay now I think has

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,020
made that possible and liquid web has

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,700

Oh 35 minutes or so

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,620
the common struggle that we all face

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,540
when it comes to productivity then we're

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,090
gonna spend some time understanding that

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,950
problem a bit and developing a strategy

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,870
to deal with that issue and last of all

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,360
just a few suggestions from my own

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,580
personal experience and failure of

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,500
trying to do this myself ok so by the

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,270

that that's pretty awesome right ok so

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,480
let's talk about the common struggle one

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,170
of the issues that everybody who does

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,860
any kind of business experiences is the

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:57,160
struggle between strategy and execution

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,020
now the execution are the things we do

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,280
the strategy is the why and how we do it

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,250
there's a lot of talks this weekend at

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,770
WordCamp about the execution you gotta

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,230
know the SEO techniques right you got to

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,760
know the PHP and JavaScript you got to

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,340
know the plugins and all of those things

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,830
you got to know this but here's what

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,600
I've discovered a lot of people who go

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,280
into WordPress as a freelancer and those

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,470
of you who are freelancers here see if

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,420
this sounds like you you go into

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,740
business as a freelancer you love to do

00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,510
the WordPress thing you love to build

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,070
websites for clients you get all nerd it

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,010
out into the tech and that's awesome and

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:36,640
then about a year in you realize oh my

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,620
gosh I have a business now and there's a

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,919
whole other set of problems not only do

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,629
you have to know the tech

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,150
you got to know the strategy you got to

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,969
know the why behind the what right and

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,069
so we hit a wall it's predictable 18

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:50,360
months roughly and just about every

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,710
freelance life how many have you hit

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,460
that wall you've been a freelancer you

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,800
hit that wall yeah me too so I want to

00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,479
spend some time in the first part of

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,729
this talk putting some terminology to a

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,499
struggle that I believe everybody in

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:08,060
business of really any kind especially

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:09,680
freelancers faces so both of these

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,050
things are critical execution and

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,340
strategy now here's the thing we all

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,599
understand I mean you're reasonably

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,550
intelligent people like Chris said

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,870
earlier you're either insane or you're

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,180
awesome for being here at a tech

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,340
conference on a Saturday we understand

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,289
the need for strategy we understand that

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,750
we need to be more efficient more

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,310
productive more profitable we get that

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,889
we understand how those things connect

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,870
but it's the doing of the strategy the

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,750
actually executing of the strategy on a

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,029
weekly basis that gets messy right it

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,770
gets tough that's why we go to a

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,259
conference we pick up great ideas and we

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,689
do nothing with them because we get

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,580
stuff going on right so how many of you

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:48,199
this is what I keep pointing to there as

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,849
though their slides here how many of you

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,879
this is what your strategy looks like

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:55,580
you are steadily improving over time

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,360
steadily improving mark is steadily

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,919
improving you can go to his talk later

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,479
called steadily improving or does your

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,719
productivity world look more like

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,520
something similar to this yes right so

00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:11,750
we do okay and then we backtrack and we

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,669
go around we get caught in the twists

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,889
and turns for many of us we just get

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,469
busy we get distracted we get distracted

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,629
by old habits and we're backtracking and

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:25,639
we're back to where we started why is it

00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:28,370
so hard to keep strategy in focus I mean

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,139
you read a great book you you read a

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,269
great blog post you come to a word camp

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,909
you listen to a webinar you find some

00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,469
amazing things that you know you need to

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,010
learn the know you know you need to do

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,240
things you know you need to put in to

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,039
install into your business how many of

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,050
you this morning have learned something

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,660
in business or some tech thing that you

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,040
know you need to do next week how many

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:56,030
of you're going to do it right okay

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,160
so we have a list of changes that we

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,140
need to make usually that never seems to

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,820
get shorter a list of things to

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,890
accomplish that's always getting longer

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,810
so what are you gonna do with all the

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,300
cool stuff that you learn this weekend

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,830
at WordCamp what happens when you get

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,790
home

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,490
we tend never to put it into practice

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,500
but why is that it's not that you didn't

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,480
have good intentions it's not that the

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,920
presenter wasn't awesome it's not that

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,080
the author of the book wasn't awesome

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,430
it's that you you start thinking about

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,770
putting them into practice and then life

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,870
gets in the way right you get to your

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,260
desk and there's 15 emails from clients

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,720
the phone rings you have family stuff

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,870
that goes along three months later

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,140
no change whatsoever does that sound

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,180
familiar yeah me too so I'm gonna put a

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,760
word around this concept and it is

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:49,430
whirlwind the whirlwind the whirlwind is

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,400
the thing that keeps us from getting

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,040
strategy done now it's been a little bit

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,300
of time understanding this concept of

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,950
whirlwind we need to know we're up

00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,510
against we need to know our enemy

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,920
what is the whirlwind now the working

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,920
definition we're gonna use here is that

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,730
the whirlwind is the energy and

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,930
attention needed to run your business

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:15,320
the whirlwind is the urgent the

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,460
whirlwind is the 14 emails from clients

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,470
that are waiting on you when you get

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,940
into your office in the morning all with

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,030
demands things for things that have to

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,770
be done by noon you've been there it's

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,690
the customer call that happens right

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,810
when you were just about to work on your

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,490
own website for a change

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,770
it's the one-hour meeting with a client

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,840
that stretches into three and takes up

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:39,500
the rest of your afternoon to sound

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,570
familiar okay you come to your desk with

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,340
the best of intentions it's gonna be a

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,020
day where I finally get to work on my

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,880
stuff finally get some strategy

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,080
accomplished and it lasts about 10

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,700
minutes because the whirlwind showed up

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,380
now spent hours and hours and seminars

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,210
and webinars and all these things and

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,380
I've filled my brain with things that

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,540
need to be done but never get done

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,740
because I'll let the whirlwind get in

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,750
the way

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,880
now here's the problem the goals and the

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,200
strategy are important we understand

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,120
that but the whirlwind is the urgent and

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,680
there's an astute statement that the

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,880
Franklin Covey corporation maybe if you

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,020
guys know a Franklin Covey all the

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,670
old-timers remember the Franklin day

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,110
planner anybody use that and then this

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,990
is Stephen Covey of the Habits of Highly

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,040
Effective People Franklin Covey company

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:32,190
says when urgency and importance clash

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,860
urgency wins every time every time right

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,280
and it does doesn't it every single time

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,630
because it's urgent or perceived to be

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,330
urgent that's a whole other talk urgency

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,330
wins every time so when it comes to our

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:52,440
own strategy and goals what do we say

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:57,780
I'll do it later tomorrow next week next

00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,720
quarter here's the problem delaying

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,860
strategy doesn't work because when you

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,700
say I'll do it tomorrow

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,620
guess what's waiting on you tomorrow the

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,360
roll win when you say oh we'll get to

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,730
that next week what happens what's

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,830
waiting on you next week the whirlwind

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,280
exactly and we never seem to learn that

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,630
lesson now before you get the wrong idea

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,450
about the whirlwind the Portland isn't

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,930
bad okay the whirlwind is not bad it

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,690
just is what it is the high wind is your

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,980
business it's your work if you don't

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,920
have the whirlwind you'd have nothing to

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,230
be strategic about okay so it's not bad

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,480
it just is what it is it's a fact of

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,460
life you've got to realize this and take

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,170
this concept of whirlwind into account

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,780
while you're trying to grow your

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,700
business we have to accept it and figure

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,250
out some sort of strategy to move our

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,890
businesses forward recognizing the

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,160
reality of the whirlwind are you with me

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,490
okay

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,930
so let's talk about taming the whirlwind

00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:00,690
how do you get the whirlwind under

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:02,819
control you need a plan you got to have

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,170
a plan

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:06,399
if you're freelance or if you're a web

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,629
business owner I'm gonna take it for

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,860
granted that you're a smart person if

00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,240
you're here on a Saturday at a tech

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,550
conference I'm going to take it for

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,800
granted that you understand the concepts

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,369
and you have some reasonable level of

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,589
discipline the challenge is not

00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:23,170
accomplishing goals the challenge is how

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,319
do I accomplish my goals in the middle

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,709
of the whirlwind because without a plan

00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:32,170
the whirlwind always wins it just does

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:35,470
without a plan the whirlwind wins every

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,970
time why because urgency wins every time

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,619
and you've seen that happen right over

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,970
and over week after week I'd go into the

00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,230
week with the greatest of intentions the

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,970
whirlwind kicks my butt and I have

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,939
nothing done strategically by the end of

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,160
the week okay I told you they were known

00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:52,269
unique issues right how many of you face

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,869
exactly exactly that okay so here's the

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,819
plan

00:13:52,869 --> 00:14:00,209
three parts it's easy to follow it's

00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:02,980
easy to understand it's harder to follow

00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:05,980
okay you're gonna start with an initial

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,029
planning meeting with your ownself we're

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,129
going to follow that up with some weekly

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,620
planning and in weekly execution that's

00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,749
it one first meeting a weekly planning

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,059
meeting and a weekly execution this

00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:18,220
works whether you're on a team or

00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,749
whether you are a solopreneur it works

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,179
whether you own your own business or if

00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:24,610
you're an employee this works all the

00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:27,699
way around you're going to start with an

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:32,350
initial planning meeting that is two

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:34,959
hours unplugged now let me emphasize the

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,839
fact unplugged and I realize that's

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,429
weird at a tech conference okay matter

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,249
of fact the Downloads I give you I used

00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,660
to make those a syllable PDF and I

00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,009
stopped doing that and I'll explain why

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,509
in a little while you need to be

00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,160
completely unplugged you need to turn

00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,899
off the screens because this is what I

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,610
learned after lots of years of doing

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:58,059
this wrong you know where the whirlwind

00:14:51,610 --> 00:15:01,360
lives on the screen phone email slack

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,189
Twitter you name it right we have 1800

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,559
points of access into our life that we

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:07,179
let things into so my suggestion is for

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,279
this first initial planning meeting with

00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,399
yourself turn off screens turn off your

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,549
phone go to someplace where you can

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,449
easily concentrate now for some of you

00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,220
that may be a stimulus

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,660
environment like a coffee shop or

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,919
someone were there's stuff going on or

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,079
you may be the kind of person where you

00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,579
need to be alone isolated you know

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,379
sitting on your deck and everything's

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,839
quiet or somewhere like in a library or

00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:31,149
whatever go somewhere that you do not

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,649
work don't try to do this in the office

00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,249
space where you normally work go

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,220
somewhere else

00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:39,609
it's amazing what that little shift does

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,829
to your mind get a notebook and a pen or

00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:45,730
if you're afraid of commitment a pencil

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:48,100
and you're gonna do some things take

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,559
some time to let the whirlwind calm down

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,850
in your mind that's a critical and

00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,649
you've got to schedule this the

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,389
scheduling of it and the actual having

00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,160
the meeting with yourself is as I've

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,509
coached people through this process one

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
of the hardest things and you and I

00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,339
promise you you have to put this on the

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,230
calendar with an alert or two to remind

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,549
you to do this because otherwise the

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,889
client work comes up the client work

00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:13,720
comes up and if you've planned I'm gonna

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,609
do this on Friday afternoon from 2:00 to

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,619
4:00 p.m. I'm gonna have this meeting

00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,850
with myself and a client calls and says

00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,049
I need to meet with you Friday afternoon

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,669
you can't because y'all ready have a

00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:24,999
meeting scheduled with your most

00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:26,649
important client your self okay it's got

00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:28,809
to be scheduled so here's what you're

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,239
gonna do two hours two tasks you got it

00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:33,129
two hours two tasks task number one is

00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:35,230
you're gonna identify the issues task

00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:38,889
number two you're gonna plan some action

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,239
items here's how this works first thing

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,980
you're gonna do in this two-hour meeting

00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:44,559
is identify some issues you need to ask

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,059
yourself a very difficult question what

00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,169
are the changes that I need to make

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:52,929
today to improve my business what are

00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:56,649
some things I need to improve today to

00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:59,619
improve my business what are the things

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,160
that bring the most immediate impact now

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:04,269
this is critical to the process

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,189
immediate impact is important because

00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:09,490
anytime you're establishing new habits

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,720
you need to have little winds that build

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,600
momentum how many of you have learned

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,959
that since December I dropped 80 pounds

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,270
and I've learned that process

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,100
that process was the result of little

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,199
small changes micro habits that could

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,050
continue to repeat every day okay and

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,880
this is the same way you've got to do

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,830
some make some changes that are gonna

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,190
bring immediate impact to your business

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,340
because the momentum that you get from

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,900
small changes it's whirlwind repellant

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,730
it keeps the whirlwind away at least in

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,000
your mind now the other thing I'll tell

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,110
you is this the changes that you need to

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,330
make that are gonna bring the most

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,220
immediate impact you ready for this are

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,950
probably not things you're gonna enjoy

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,490
doing because you would have done them

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:58,160
already right so pick pick you're gonna

00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,510
pick the top three prioritize them what

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,340
are the things I need to do today

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,770
they're gonna bring the most immediate

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,750
impact to my business be honest with

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,060
yourself and pick the top three the

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,170
three most important things now the

00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,660
second thing you do in that planning

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,450
meeting is some action items you're

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,250
gonna look at those three items the

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,930
three things you don't need to do today

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,010
to bring immediate impact to your

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,320
business you're going to break those

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,730
things down into action items they're

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,020
gonna take you two to four hours to

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,800
complete there's a reason for that

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,990
I'll get to it in a minute you got it

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,850
two hour meeting two tasks test number

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,160
one pick out your top three issues task

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,200
number to break those issues down into

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,420
two to four hour action items are you

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,370
with me everybody together you got it so

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,660
far this is not hard to understand it's

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,400
hard to do here's a tool and we're gonna

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,440
try to swap to a different screen and

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,590
see this again you can download this

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,970
tool at Nathan Ingram calm /wc ATL the

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,590
hashtag for this event you'll find the

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,980
download for these slides and the tool

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,160
there and did this just work no it did

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,590
not

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,590
okay let's try this again let's go out

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:10,220
well look at that awesome okay so this

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,660
is a very simple little worksheet that I

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,460
use in my coaching program which is

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,860
called advanced and how many of you have

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,330
heard the term SMART goals

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,270
SMART goals right so smart is an acronym

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,500
for specific measurable attainable or

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,980
actionable depending on who you listen

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,780
to relevant and time-bound without all

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,220
five of those pieces it's not really a

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,210
goal it's not a good goal it's not a

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,560
SMART goal for sure

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,500
so this first

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,090
Paige here is this is the printable I'm

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,640
going to skip down for our purposes to

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,600
the next one which is an example so you

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,240
can't see that at all let's zoom in

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,490
alright so in this example our

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,850
hypothetical person who is filling out

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,130
this particular worksheet realizes that

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,450
I need to have recurring revenue in my

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,130
business to be stable how many of you

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,410
have learned that hard lesson I talked

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,790
about that I think last year here you

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,680
got to have recurring revenue it starts

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,650
with WordPress maintenance plan centered

00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,720
around a great host and it also includes

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,910
other things like for example a social

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,800
media service so here is the specific

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,620
part of this goal I need to create a

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,420
social media services service to create

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,510
and manage social properties and content

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,520
for my clients that's specific it's

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,530
answering the question what do I really

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,940
want to accomplish and you're answering

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,190
questions like who what when where and

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,680
how it's the details of the goal that

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,980
goes in that first box then we're gonna

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,540
move into the measurable piece how do I

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,460
know I'm making progress you think about

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,960
how much and how many well I'm gonna

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,420
start with Facebook they maybe consider

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,490
adding interest of Instagram and

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,260
Pinterest and then we're gonna move to

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,590
the attainable piece is this a goal I

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,470
can actually achieve sometimes your goal

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,080
is so abstract it's not ever something

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,380
you could take action on alright so it

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,730
needs to be actionable attainable so at

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,200
this point you're you know maybe some

00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,730
next steps or what are the obstacles in

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
the way it's attainable but I need to

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,700
understand Facebook Ads I need to

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,010
develop a template for social marketing

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,570
I need to figure out a good platform for

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:09,620
management all right then we move into

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,810
the relevancy piece this is critical

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,340
this is the piece of the goal that most

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,710
people leave out and it's why in my

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,930
opinion many goals fail because you fail

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,180
to connect the goal to real life and say

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,010
why it's important why is this NGO

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,680
important how does it fit in the rest of

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:27,470
my business in life I am doing this so

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,060
that what I'm doing this social media

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,160
service because I need to offer more

00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,470
than just website creation services and

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,270
adding a social media management service

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,040
is key to building that recurring

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,870
revenue that's going to stabilize the

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,210
rest of my world that's why it's

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,100
important now the relevancy is important

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,820
because when the whirlwind starts to

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,429
spin

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,220
this is where you remind yourself I am I

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,109
have to do this so that I can get this

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,450
thing out and build recurring revenue

00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:56,389
are you with me okay

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,950
and last of all time bound when will

00:21:56,389 --> 00:22:00,409
this goal be completed because a goal

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,419
without a deadline is just an idea it's

00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:04,549
a put a date on it I'll have it ready by

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,409
April the 30th now that's typical SMART

00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,749
goal right we've seen SMART goals this

00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,519
is very typical now I've taken it one

00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:13,909
step further because over here in the

00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:17,299
right-hand column I like to phrase my

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:19,159
goals in terms of a declaration it's

00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,249
like taking your goal and saying I will

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,279
I will do this and I've given you a

00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:26,779
little formula I will some combination

00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,159
of the stuff and specific and measurable

00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:34,340
by the time bound piece because or so

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,590
that the relevancy piece here's what

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,109
this looks like for phrases the SMART

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,749
goal I will create a social media

00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:44,299
management service for my clients using

00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:45,919
Facebook by March the 31st because it's

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,080
a key to building recurring revenue in

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,809
my business does that make sense that's

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,919
a good goal it's measurable it's time

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,349
down and you know what I'm gonna do with

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,210
that I'm gonna print that thing out in a

00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:59,269
hundred and twelve point font and put it

00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,789
right in front of me on my wall I will

00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:04,429
because this other thing is important to

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,529
me and as I sit down at my desk every

00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:08,869
day and the ruin is I'm being tempted by

00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,029
the whirlwind to get distracted doing

00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:14,210
some other things I know I've got this

00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:16,190
time I've got to get this done I've got

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,840
to get this done and it's important

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,129
because I have to build that recurring

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,200
revenue does that make sense alright now

00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,419
the next thing I mean this is the gold

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,009
generator I'm suggesting that in that

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,869
initial planning meeting with yourself

00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:31,159
you fill out three of these you pick

00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:32,899
your top three things you know you need

00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,299
to change and you phrase them in terms

00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:36,679
of a smart goal can you do that if

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:38,269
you'll do this you'll move forward I

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,129
promise you I'm not saying this is the

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,659
only way I'm just saying it is a way

00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:42,950
that I've coached people through over

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,999
the last several years and it totally

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,710
works three items three gold generators

00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:51,169
now the other thing I told you to do was

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,529
plan action items two to four our action

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:56,090
items and there's a second page of the

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,910
packet you can download that's the goal

00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,560
manager

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,540
then lets you flush these things out so

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,310
you state your goal here's some spaces

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,170
I'm gonna move on just for the sake of

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,260
time but down here at the bottom it's

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,610
where you can write in action items are

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,330
gonna take you two to four hours to

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,590
complete you got it so in that first

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,090
meeting with yourself use these

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,470
worksheets print them out if you find a

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,780
better way fine using it's not about

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,940
those worksheets this is just boxes on a

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,130
page right but you want to have three

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,600
things you need to do and some action

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:29,250
items broken down that's the big picture

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:40,140
everybody can do that now let's get back

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:45,030
into this one of the twists where people

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:47,130
fall off in this model is we have the

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,290
first meeting we get our goal set and

00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,810
never do anything else just like always

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,700
never done it was a great idea I got

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,710
some stuff on paper nothing ever changes

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,050
you must you must you must

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,940
before you start your week plan your

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,380
week how many of you plan your week

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,270
before it starts awesome so whenever

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,850
that happens for me it's usually Friday

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,170
afternoons usually clients don't call on

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,600
Friday afternoons they're thinking about

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,760
their weekend too and Friday afternoons

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,230
generally speaking it's when I stop and

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
I plan the week ahead and I do some

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,800
strategy work I'm gonna give you a

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,900
little some format for this in a minute

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,850
whenever it is maybe it's Sunday

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,790
evenings for you maybe it's early Monday

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,740
mornings the point is before you hit

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,240
your chair on Monday morning

00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,250
make sure the week is planned out

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,010
because guess what happens as soon as

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,050
you hit your chair on Monday morning the

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,960
lowland is waiting on you right you turn

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,190
on the beam 15 emails being two texts I

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,200
hope you're not letting your clients

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,410
text you that's a whole other that's a

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,690
whole other talk we know we have to do

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,490
this because without a plan the

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,920
whirlwind always wins because the

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,230
whirlwind is waiting on you to open your

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,480
email on Monday morning to totally wipe

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,120
out your plan if you don't have one okay

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,890
so that weekly planning takes usually a

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,740
half an hour it's not hard you get

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,210
better at it as you go and during this

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,010
weekly planning

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,429
what you're gonna do is take one of

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,929
those action items one of those - two

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:17,820
for our action items and you're gonna

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,039
look at your calendar and you are going

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,809
to schedule time that week to get it

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,130
done so let's just say you've learned

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,320
something cool at work campus this

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:29,340
weekend and you know hey I need to do

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:32,159
this in the next you know four weeks and

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,020
you can break it down into four simple

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
to two four-hour things that you can do

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,000
and over that time you'll have the thing

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,320
done and before the Week starts you're

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,039
gonna plan okay you know what this week

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,600
you'll see how things looked

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,510
appointments here and there Wednesday

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,279
afternoon I can schedule three hours to

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,740
do this thing somebody put that on the

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,360
calendar it's an appointment if a client

00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,250
calls and wants to talk or meet with me

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,870
on Wednesday afternoon I'm not available

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,190
you wouldn't cancel another client

00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,010
appointment to meet with a different

00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,570
Clio you are your most important client

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,179
so it's scheduled it's on the calendar

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,770
with a reminder and you stop you have to

00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,200
stop what you're doing and actually do

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,990
the thing it's got to be on the calendar

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,120
so plan that time to execute at least

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,620
one action if you can do more scheduled

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,330
more maybe it's a light week so maybe

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,330
you can do more strategy but just

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,850
schedule it now here's the way in a very

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,580
oversimplified manner this is the way I

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,220
look at my week I break down my week

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,690
every day of the week into three blocks

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,679
there's a morning and afternoon the

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:34,799
evening brilliant right okay brilliant

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,760
so my family gets one the highest

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,210
priority for me in this world is my

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,649
family it's the most important thing my

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:49,649
family always gets one piece of my day

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:52,470
so if I'm on a deadline and I have to

00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,360
work morning afternoon evening guess

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,070
what my family gets paid back one block

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,140
you know so if I'm working late one day

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,049
maybe I take half a day off later that

00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,190
week to pay my family back I look at in

00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:03,539
a big picture this is how I'm going to

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,020
block out my time here's it's like a

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,570
typical oversimplified week with the

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,980
whirlwind concept so Monday's the

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,700
whirlwind lives on Mondays how many of

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,700
you figure that out

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,169
support tickets came in this weekend so

00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,549
Monday you know in this week hey we're

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,049
gonna we're gonna spend all day long

00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,239
just dealing with whirlwind stuff

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,679
dealing with client requests whatever it

00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,159
gets though in Monday night I'm with my

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,690
family

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,100
Tuesday hey we got a project we're

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,080
working on we're building a website for

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,039
a client and I'm gonna spend Tuesday

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,009
afternoon working on that project if I'm

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,350
in a project block everything gets

00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,429
turned off email gets turned off my

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,590
phone gets turned off

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:44,019
I'm not reachable during that time so

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,960
I'm head down doing stuff for the client

00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,850
have you discovered that if you leave

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,980
your email on and you're trying to focus

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,029
on client work what happens whenever you

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,210
get that alert for a new email

00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:58,749
notification we are like Pavlov's dogs

00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,980
the email being I got to look at that we

00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:01,419
have multiple monitors we're looking all

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,009
over the place or but slack because

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:04,299
something has happened in slack we have

00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:07,029
to stop the world because something has

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:10,299
happened in slack right turn all that

00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:14,739
stuff off your client unless the server

00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:17,109
goes down which is come on we're right

00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:20,379
your client can wait two to four hours

00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:21,820
or whatever it is so block the time out

00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,139
I'm working on a project that day same

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,960
for Wednesday again my family's getting

00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:27,789
Eve Nights so this doesn't happen nearly

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,220
as much as it used to but when my kids

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,019
were smaller we homeschool and so a lot

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,759
of times we'll go and do stuff as a

00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,320
family during the day maybe I'm taking

00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,789
Thursday morning and we're going to some

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,169
Museum or some whatever with the

00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,850
homeschool group I'm gonna take that

00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:42,879
time to be with my kids it's awesome but

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm working that night my family gets

00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:46,450
one block see how that works now this is

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,279
dramatically oversimplified but for the

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,859
purposes of illustration there you go

00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:52,869
now Friday look at Friday there's a

00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:55,059
strategy block it's red Friday afternoon

00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,429
nothing gets scheduled Friday afternoon

00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,619
because that's the time when I am doing

00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:01,570
strategy for my business that's the time

00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:03,850
when I'm going to execute on a two to

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,009
four hour action item one or more of

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,499
those things and nothing gets scheduled

00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:11,950
during that time this is not hard to

00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:13,690
understand is it it's hard to do it's

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,750
hard to make yourself do it that's the

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:20,250
hard part

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:23,130
so notice that the whirlwind can be

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,900
contained it can be contained if you'll

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,120
just put some good productivity habits

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,570
in place now Adam right here Adam with

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,100
the Hat

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,659
Adam is given a talk tomorrow you guys

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,070
should totally go to on productivity

00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,500
where he's going to talk about the more

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,970
internal personal side is that right so

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,770
make sure you look at Adams talk when is

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,900
it tomorrow 10:00 a.m. in this room on

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,549
tomorrow so come back and hear that so

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,440
just using some good techniques of time

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:48,390
blocking again oversimplified look at

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,830
that but it's there scheduling your

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,840
phone and email tom how many of you when

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,110
your client calls no matter what you're

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,520
doing you stop and pick up the phone and

00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,440
we call it we pat ourselves on the back

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,159
it's a great customer service

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,630
it's terrible productivity habits

00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,909
terrible product or if the client sends

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,530
you an email you reply right back no

00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:09,390
matter what else is going on we pat

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,490
ourselves on the back wonderful customer

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,159
service when in fact you have trained

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,280
your client by that habit of expecting a

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,010
reply from you immediately that is not

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,260
sustainable as you grow it's not

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,880
sustainable I've even gotten to where if

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,010
a client if I happen to be doing email

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,140
and an email comes in I will actually

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,400
delay the sending of that email and

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,330
pause the sin for a few hours sometimes

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:43,130
hope my clients aren't watching this

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:46,710
video just thought about that anyhow so

00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,690
yes use totally if you're trying to run

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,940
client support out of your inbox stop it

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,409
today that's a whole other talk but yeah

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,429
get those things out of your inbox you

00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,710
can focus on what matters

00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,330
alright so in the weekly execution time

00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,130
this is that read time that just showed

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,840
you on that illustration two to four

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,210
hours schedule a time don't compromise

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,700
it maybe for a real emergency and it

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,919
needs to be a real emergency a client

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,230
needing something done is not usually a

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,000
real emergency a client needs an image

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,630
changed on their website can wait till

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,640
tomorrow morning don't break your

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,700
schedule you are more important than any

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,620
of your clients if a client calls and

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,510
you're trying to do strategy time don't

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,039
stop doing what you're doing and pick up

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,380
the phone if you were a meeting with

00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,160
another client and another client called

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,320
you would you

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,600
walk away from your client meeting and

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,560
take a call from another client that's

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
insane

00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,980
so don't do it when you're dealing with

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:44,100
your most important client which is

00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:47,070
yourself don't compromise the time all

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:50,490
right now the initial planning meeting

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,780
two hours two tasks identify the issues

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,220
and break them down into action items

00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,630
each week we're gonna plan time to

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,420
execute each one of those action items

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,970
and then actually get it done now

00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:03,590
roughly every quarter you should have

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:07,860
probably executed on those three items

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,930
and so roughly every quarter ish repeat

00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,310
the process sit down with yourself again

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,750
make a list of all the things that need

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,620
to be done in your business or look at

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,450
what you had from before

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,730
make sure the priority still fall in

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,080
line and pick three more things you

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,610
repeat that every there's a great book

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,990
by the way called twelve week year if

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,480
you haven't read that highly recommend

00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,700
it it kind of gets into a quarterly

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,120
planning process like this you repeat it

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,430
every quarter it is a simple process to

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,140
understand it's harder to execute but

00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,390
you simply have to say no I'm not gonna

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,220
let my life be ruled by the whirlwind

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,540
I'm gonna put some control around it and

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,740
you can actually start to move your

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,960
business forward so let's let's wrap up

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,960
with a few practical suggestions

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,260
but first and this is from all of my

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,080
failures okay this is where I've screwed

00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,560
things up

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,540
you got to prioritize be brutally honest

00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,510
and this is where it's helpful to have a

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,340
business coach or someone as chris said

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,890
earlier this morning someone who's okay

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,460
with calling you stupid to your face

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,740
you've got to have some of those

00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,390
friendships in your life and if it's

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,280
somebody else in the WordPress space or

00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:19,110
the web space who understands the

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,220
challenges that we go through having

00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,860
somebody like that you that you were

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,690
that transparent with that can cut and

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,580
let them bounce off your priorities a

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,310
little bit you got to prioritize because

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,100
you will always have more goals than you

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,540
have time you'll always have more goals

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,400
than you have time that's why you have

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,730
to focus on the things that build

00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,650
momentum what do you really really need

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,770
to do because like I said there's a

00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:46,130
psychology to this do the things that

00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:49,380
bring immediate impact to build momentum

00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:52,530
because that's gonna pay off Franklin

00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,640
Covey company again had this statistic

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,060
and I'm sorry for those of you over here

00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,920
the statistic was if the number of goals

00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,050
you try to accomplish in addition to the

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,240
chaos of the whirlwind if you have two

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,190
to three goals to accomplish in addition

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,650
to the whirlwind you'll accomplish two

00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,050
to three goals if he try to accomplish

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,460
four to ten goals in addition to the

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,250
whirlwind you'll accomplish one or two

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,520
goals if you try to accomplish 11 to 20

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,560
first of all you're an insane and you'll

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,870
accomplish nothing there's only so much

00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,830
time you got to focus on the things that

00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:28,860
bring immediate impact which means

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:33,090
sometimes good ideas have to put on the

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:35,220
Shelf that also means that you kind of

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,930
really you kind of look at how you're

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,000
spending your time and what you're doing

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,040
because I don't know about you but I

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,760
understand that many people in the web

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,590
space will allow a whole morning to go

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,520
by tinkering with some fancy new tool

00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,800
they found on the web

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,060
instead of doing what really matters for

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,000
their business now I'm scotch I'm sure

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,790
none of you have that problem but I do

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,730
sometimes because we're geeks right I

00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,200
mean we that's we enjoy this stuff

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,440
sometimes good ideas need to be put on

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
the Shelf they

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,640
there there on the list we'll get back

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,079
to them but for now it's not what's

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,150
gonna bring impact to my business does

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,740
that make sense I've wasted a lot of

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,290
time tinkering with stuff that really

00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,579
didn't move the yardsticks

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,880
okay second suggestion from my failures

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:21,700
is this you've got to separate your

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,500
roles particularly if you're a

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,040
freelancer small business owner agency

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,760
owner who ever you are you are both a

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,050
CEO and an employee and you get to wear

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,849
different hats how many of you wear

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,400
multiple hats in your business oh yes

00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:39,450
all right so this is the way I've

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,089
learned to think about it when I am

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:46,119
doing the strategy I am the CEO of my

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:47,980
company when I am the one sitting at the

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,680
desk executing the strategy I'm an

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,359
employee now it's a subtle mental change

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,560
that does this for me and I may be

00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,990
insane maybe this doesn't work for you

00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,839
maybe it does but if I think of myself

00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,359
that way I have a tendency while in the

00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,869
moment to decide I really don't want to

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,400
do this today I don't know about you I

00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:08,079
would really rather not be doing this

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,829
strategy piece I would rather be doing

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,190
something else

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:14,290
but no no my role sitting in that chair

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,319
is an employee who has to execute the

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:23,290
plan the CEO set last week does that

00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:24,490
help the things that we do for strategy

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,079
for our business or oftentimes

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:32,290
incredibly difficult and it is easier

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,060
here this it's easier to do client work

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,730
than it is to do sometimes the

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:40,720
soul-searching gut wrenching strategy

00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:43,829
that our business requires so when you

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,140
as the CEO get a change of venue a

00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,300
change of scenery to let the whirlwind

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,060
die down in your mind to figure out the

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,710
things that really matter that's got to

00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,230
be the priority and when you're sitting

00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,210
in the desk is an employee executing the

00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,030
strategy you don't get to change what's

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:04,990
gonna happen because you're wearing a

00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:07,240
different hat okay third thing block

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,859
your time I reference this a minute ago

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,730
in the little chart but you got to block

00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:15,609
your time it is critical to recognize

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,300
the best time of day for you to do each

00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,430
kind of

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,320
ask if you can figure this out I'm

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,670
working on a Content piece for this but

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,180
if you can figure this out

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:27,520
it's absolutely it's empowering I

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,730
realized a while back that in the

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,230
morning between about 8:00 and 10:00

00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,770
that is the time when I am innovative

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,900
and creative and you added four years

00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:40,690
I'd come in sit at my desk and what do

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:43,510
you think I did check your email and I

00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:47,770
squandered the best part of the day on

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,570
knucklehead stuff when I learned to not

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,140
look at my email till 10:30 11 o'clock

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,240
in the morning and spend that high-value

00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,550
highest quality time in my own thought

00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,840
space on the stuff that really matters

00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,490
when I'm the most creative and most

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,050
innovative I'm doing design then I'm

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,500
building content doing those sorts of

00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,580
things at that time revolutionary now I

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,530
took me forever to figure this out

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,490
because I'm an idiot but maybe you

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,100
figured this out already

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,780
but you take a hard look at the times a

00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,240
day when you do the best you know the

00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,740
certain kinds of work the best when do

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,120
you do the innovative strategy stuff

00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,800
when are you good to figure out detail

00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,880
problems when should you just be you

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,470
know it's kind of the down part of the

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,910
day where you just be doing knucklehead

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,520
stuff like responding to client email x'

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,950
and things like that figure that out and

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,350
you will be able to tame the whirlwind a

00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,750
lot faster because the whirlwind gets a

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,950
lot smaller because you're more

00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,510
efficient in the moment does that make

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,860
sense

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:42,280
when are you the most energized figure

00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,870
that out I also schedule those emails

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,320
and phone calls schedule them

00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,850
it is clients generally speaking there's

00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,500
one or two clients to pay a lot of money

00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,790
who have access to me at any time and

00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,590
I'll pick up the phone except for

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,440
strategy times if they call they don't

00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,240
call much but when they do I answer the

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,550
rest of them we're gonna schedule a call

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,520
they always get voicemail they always

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,930
get voicemail and will call them and

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,820
figure out a callback or have an online

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,940
calendar system or they send in the

00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:13,570
support ticket or whatever you're you

00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,100
are not that necessary sometimes we have

00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,690
this in our mind look my client needs to

00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,160
have me right now no they just need to

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,260
change an image on a blog post and that

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,990
can wait till tomorrow you know really I

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,000
mean really right I need to be spending

00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,110
my time doing something else that's more

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,110
important to move my business forward

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:33,020
never ever check your email first thing

00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:37,040
in the morning the whole wind lives in

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:39,640
your email okay last one this is where I

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,050
admit the deep hypocrisy in my heart

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,000
taming the whirlwind takes time so you

00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,440
got to give yourself a break there's a

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,750
great quote that I've found attributed

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,160
to many people I think it was GK

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,110
Chesterton who has a lot of great quotes

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,070
the internet says so so you know it must

00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,950
be true

00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:59,080
anything worth doing is worth doing

00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:01,160
badly at first and I love that quote

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,260
anything worth doing is worth doing

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,590
badly at first it takes time to

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:10,280
establish habits so I mentioned at the

00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:12,140
very beginning of this talk that I the

00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,460
issue that has kicked my butt more than

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,250
any for the first quarter of this year

00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:20,120
is this very issue of strategy and

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:22,840
productivity I my client the client part

00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,920
of my time spun out of control

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,930
completely spun out of control this

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,940
first quarter I'm behind on stuff I'm

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,680
never behind on stuff I'm behind on

00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,350
things there's way too many demands I am

00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,100
stressed out I'm working at night way

00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,110
more than I should

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,560
my wife is keeping a tally well I'll

00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:42,110
have to pay these nights back which is

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,930
fine I blew it

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:48,170
royally which i think is just you know

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,580
in providence really funny that i gave

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,780
this talk last weekend in Orange County

00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,370
I gave it once this week on are things

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,380
training and I'm giving it in here today

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,720
so three times in one week I'm giving

00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,610
this talk reminding myself you can't and

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,020
as a result I've made some strategic

00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,660
changes in my business to deal with that

00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,370
but my point in telling that story is

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,530
this I've been teaching this and

00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,060
coaching this for years and I screwed it

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,030
up this past quarter screwed it up

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,530
completely it's easy to do so give

00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,660
yourself a break pick yourself up and

00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,490
figure out okay I made a mess what's

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,870
next what do I learn from that how do I

00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,480
do it better next time it's okay

00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:24,920
anything worth doing bat at worth doing

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,200
is worth doing badly at first so key

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,520
takeaways the woman never goes away it's

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,650
always going to be there you can't push

00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,240
off strategy delaying strategy doesn't

00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,210
work because when urgency and importance

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,970
clash urgency wins every time so you got

00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,560
to have this strategy to accomplish your

00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,510
goals in the middle of a whirlwind now

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,040
let me leave it off with this

00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,960
if you did this first of all let me ask

00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,820
this how many of you think you could

00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,040
execute that strategy have a meeting

00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,670
with yourself pick some goals spend some

00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,800
time each week sure what would happen

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,450
what would happen after one quarter

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,160
three months in your business of doing

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:04,859
that what would happen how would your

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,980
business change if you actually put this

00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,359
process into practice

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,520
how would your business change if you

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,950
did would you be more efficient more

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,960
effective more profitable

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,790
what would you be able to do that you

00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,380
haven't been able to do yet what's on

00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:21,690
your to-do list that needs to be

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,640
accomplished that might finally get to

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,980
be accomplished and if you did those

00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,869
things how would your life be different

00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,970
as a result how would your life change

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:35,580
would your business maybe stop intruding

00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,630
on what really matters to you what kind

00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,460
of difference would that make how much

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,690
less stress would you have if you

00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,700
actually started moving your business

00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:46,880
forward and started to get the whirlwind

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,880
under control the concept here is margin

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,910
when you let the whirlwind die down in

00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,580
the rest of your world and you start to

00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,070
keep it in those boxes

00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:02,130
it creates margin in your life that you

00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:04,950
get to do with what you want how you

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,770
gonna spend it it's been time more with

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:10,070
your family spend time on some hobbies

00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,450
for a change take a vacation

00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:16,200
maybe spend some time being quiet and

00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:17,820
reflecting on some things maybe spend

00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,260
time on strategy and your business or

00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,420
building out the processes whatever it

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,770
is it's margin you get to do with it

00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,240
whatever you want to do with it and the

00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,740
beauty of WordPress the beauty of

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,400
freelancing and owning your own business

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,140
is your boss you get to decide how you

00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,900
know what your priorities are and let

00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,640
your business fuel those priorities

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:39,450
building margin in your world helps that

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,490
process can you do it how would you like

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,720
be different I'd love to hear stories if

00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,700

otherwise I'll be outside and here all

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:24,180
day tomorrow

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:26,330
questions snide remarks questions yes

00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,330
sir

00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,780
okay great question so the question is

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,800
for the video how do you handle weekends

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:45,770
okay let's do this truth time how many

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,320
of you work weekends a lot yeah me too I

00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,570
used to do that a lot I have not done

00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:55,760
client work on a weekend since I can

00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:58,460
remember even when I'm on a deadline

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,710
weekends belong to family that's just a

00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,670
priority I set and you know your

00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,990
priorities can be different there's

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,490
nothing wrong with that those are

00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,160
priorities that I set and so when I plan

00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:10,460
it takes that into account now I will

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,130
say this the time each week when I do

00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:16,100
the planning for the coming week for me

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,510
works best on Sunday night so Sunday

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,880
night you know after the family's wound

00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:21,560
down you know usually about 8:00 8:30 9

00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,150
o'clock it's when I take about a half

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,530
hour and I think through what's coming

00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,500
up this week and I start to put things

00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:29,000
in boxes for me that works some people

00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,190
it works great Friday afternoons or

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,800
early Monday morning or whatever find

00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,870
the time that works for you but yeah but

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:41,500
say I'm taking off from Friday night to

00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:41,500
Sunday night is my weekend right yes

00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,460
it's a great question okay so the

00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,230
question is how would you put a strategy

00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,210
like this in place if you have a

00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:58,180
full-time gig and you want to move

00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:00,580
towards freelancing or your own business

00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,250
of some sort the first thing I'll say is

00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,850
you got to do that early if you can

00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:08,530
train yourself out of the gate to be to

00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:11,800
keep your time walled in it's better now

00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,750
that being said you as an employee don't

00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,460
have nearly the control over how you

00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,440
spend your time typically as you would

00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,930
so the time you do have you need to

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,920
structure it structure at big time now I

00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:27,510
want to talk with you more about details

00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,510
later if you want to yes okay

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,540
ah okay so after screwing up how do you

00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:53,030
recover okay you got to give yourself a

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,600
lot of grace right and realize that yes

00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,980
even though I'm supposed to know what

00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,060
I'm talking about in this area it's okay

00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,650
that I screwed up because it just

00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,990
becomes another fun story to tell and I

00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,730
get to learn for it from it right so

00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,740
practically speaking the way I'm

00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:08,310
recovering from having way too much work

00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:10,380
as I hired a bunch of people and it for

00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:12,840
me this is a this might eventually turn

00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:15,660
into a tallit but look it's I am by

00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,880
nature a perfectionist like bad how many

00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,650
of you are that way it's my greatest and

00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,390
worst asset you know your your greatest

00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,250
strength or pardon me your greatest

00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,380
weakness is your greatest strength taken

00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,560
to an extreme so I have trouble letting

00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,330
go and delegating always have always

00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,270
have it's awful it's a terrible saying I

00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:35,520
struggle with it I'm finally at the

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,810
point where I'm like I can't can't do it

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,850
you've got to let it go I got people I

00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:41,430
trust I'm gonna bring him in so in my

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,600
particular case the the you have to

00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,480
figure out the root of the problem which

00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,880
was way too much work which is a good

00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,100
thing right I mean wow people want to

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,160
hire me to do the thing this is great

00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:56,670
however too much work not great being

00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,490
busy is not a badge of honor what margin

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,960
is a badge of honor having discretionary

00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,670
time is a badge of honor

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,070
that's what measures success by the way

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:09,480
margin should measure success not that

00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:11,490
I'm busy I don't like to be busy so I

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,350
brought people in that I trust to help

00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,560
