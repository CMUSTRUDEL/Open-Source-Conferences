Title: Adam Walker: How To Manage Your Time So You Can Manage Your Growing Business
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	I am the CEO of a digital agency (Sideways8) and CTO of a nonprofit (48in48). I host two podcasts (soon to be three), work out regularly, read a book every week or two, and write two to three blog posts per week. 95% of my work days end at 5pm. I also have five kids, never work weekends, and I donâ€™t consider myself to be busy. In this talk I will discuss my philosophy on getting things done and the strategies I use to get a lot done in a short amount of time. I believe every person can be insanely productive when given the right tools, mindsets and strategies.
