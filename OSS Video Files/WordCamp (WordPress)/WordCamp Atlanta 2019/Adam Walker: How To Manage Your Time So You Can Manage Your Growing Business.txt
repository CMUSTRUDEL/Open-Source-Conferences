Title: Adam Walker: How To Manage Your Time So You Can Manage Your Growing Business
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	I am the CEO of a digital agency (Sideways8) and CTO of a nonprofit (48in48). I host two podcasts (soon to be three), work out regularly, read a book every week or two, and write two to three blog posts per week. 95% of my work days end at 5pm. I also have five kids, never work weekends, and I don’t consider myself to be busy. In this talk I will discuss my philosophy on getting things done and the strategies I use to get a lot done in a short amount of time. I believe every person can be insanely productive when given the right tools, mindsets and strategies.

how to manage your time so you can

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,280
manage your growing business a couple

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,809
ground rules for this talk number one

00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,730
you don't have to be here so you can get

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,200
up and leave you need to just feel don't

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,619
feel trapped is all I'm trying to say

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,150
don't feel trapped by the room number

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm real hard to offend number two you

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,910
give yourself permission to not have

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,800
anything required of you for this moment

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,349
right so we're going to do this talk

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,940
it's not gonna be that long because I'm

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,270
not intelligent enough to fill up a

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,420
whole hour and thank you for giggling

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,340
and we're gonna do this talk and but

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,050
give yourself permission to not be have

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,180
anything required of you for like a

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,670
whole thirty minutes like for 30 minutes

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,649
you can exist in the world without

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,480
having anything required of you I just

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,129
want to get give you permission from me

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,530
because I know that matters to you and

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,600
give yourself permission so also these

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,989
slides are on my website Adams Jenna

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,280
Walker comm /wc ATL because I saw Nathan

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,140
Ingram do that and I thought that was

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,939
really clever so I stole his idea did it

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,590
and actually some components of this

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,820
talk he also talked about because his

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,310
talk was about productivity and it was

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,720
excellent so you might see some other

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,100
things reflected there though I did have

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,250
them in the slides prior to his talk

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,650
just so we're all clear

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,299

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,240

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,280
audience that's looking at me and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,229

podcast which is awesome I also blog at

Adams Joe Walker comm about productivity

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,040
and habit building and I don't know

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,470
other insane things and I have a Twitter

account where I tweet occasionally so if

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,870
you want to follow me there that'd be

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,910
awesome actually just tweeted this

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,870
morning about forty eight and forty

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,130
eight and needing more help getting

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,720
nonprofits signed up so if you want to

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,430

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,569
be amazing you can just do that now and

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,000
ignore everything else I say for the

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,840
next fifteen minutes that'd be fine all

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,799
right so we're gonna talk about

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,480
productivity so this is my family by the

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,340
way we have five kids I mentioned that

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,360
and this is us in China because we're

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,170
insane and we went to China because it

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,000
was awesome really so I'm gonna

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,069
interlace pictures of my kids throughout

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,440
this presentation so that you'll stay

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,880
entertained because I'm not sure if the

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,500
presentation is good enough so I want to

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,230
feel like I need to butter you up with

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,549
pictures of my kids so so this is us in

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,750
China and I put this for the mindset

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,390
slide because one of our mindsets as a

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,980
family is travel over stuff so we don't

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,510
really do the stuff thing and like the

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,160
whole toys thing and all that stuff I

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,019
just don't I don't need more stuff in my

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,769
house I got enough stuff in terms of

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,269
people so I feel good about that so we

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,829
get it we went to China instead it was

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,239
great so that's one of our mindset we're

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,670
gonna talk about mindsets for

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,739
productivity so the first mindset that I

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,940
want to talk about is never say busy so

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,980
people look at me and they're like okay

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,200
so you got three podcasts you got five

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,299
kids you're married you do all these

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,709
home projects you got two companies

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,940
which aren't like they kind of go

00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,500
through my whole bio and they first

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,120
think I'm completely nuts which is

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,350
probably true and the next thing they

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,290
say is you must be so busy and I'm like

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,090
no I'm not I don't use that word I don't

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,180
believe in that word I think that word

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,670
is complete junk I never use the word

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,739
busy and here's why right so busyness is

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,209
like a goldfish it grows to the size of

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,650
the bowl that you give it right like I

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,930
don't know if you know this but like

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,970
goldfish can grow like real big like my

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,380
father-in-law has a goldfish in his pond

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,750
where are the things like this big it's

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,100
a goldfish like the little tiny ones

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,870
that you get your kids over and over

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,370
again and pretend it's the same one or

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,810
yeah that's Charlie the fish and then

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,370
the next one like oh yeah that's Charlie

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,720
too you know Charlie just went on

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,610
vacation for a day while we wouldn't got

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,310
another Charlie it's cool you know and

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,780
it's like that like they good your

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,610
busyness will grow to the size of the

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,810
bowl that you give it and that's why you

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,400
have to have very specific boundaries

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,680
there's also Parkinson's Law Parkinson's

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,660
Law as the adage that work expands to

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,490
fill the time available for its

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,930
completion that's the definition on

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,090
Wikipedia which we all know is true

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,550
because it's on the Internet

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,350
okay and the last thing is just listen

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,060
busyness isn't real let's just beat

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,270
let's just be real honest real talk for

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,400

busyness fills the space that you've

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,169
given it's not a real thing you don't

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,360

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,220
don't be busy you don't have to be busy

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,960

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,020
mean just like this be real the reality

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,759
is we do a ton of stuff every day and

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,340
there's a lot of stuff in our daily

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,740
lives and in our business that just does

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:05,020
not make a difference it just does it

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,449
and we spend all this time all we got to

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,970
do this I got to do this I mean we don't

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,979
have to the 80/20 rule it's the Pareto

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,300
principle awesome there's 80/20 rule or

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,220
the law of the vital few or the

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,259
principle of factors sparsity which

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,389
sounds way cooler by the way saves that

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,039
for many events roughly 80% of the

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,509
effects come from 20% of the causes I

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,120
can look back at my business the growth

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,370
of sideways 8 and in my role at sideways

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,259
8 is kind of like that top funnel sales

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,030
so I'm like people come to you like hey

00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,680
we need a website like oh that's awesome

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,419
you need a website let's talk about that

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,400
for five minutes and let me talk let me

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,229
put you with my buddy Brett here see

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,250
Brett's over there and he takes him all

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,380
the rest of the way he does all the real

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,909
work I just like I just you know wave at

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:48,219
them like shake some hands and stuff

00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:50,409
right and if I look at my daily tasks in

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,900
reality very little of what I do is

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:56,680
directly impacting that but that's the

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:00,310
thing that's the thing that I do I bring

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,740
in business and so one of the things I'm

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,780
working to do is do less stuff because

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,940
the reality is so much of what I do is

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,259
up being fluff some of the conversations

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,259
that I do a lot of the meetings that I

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,539
take I don't need to take them I don't

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,159
need or they don't need to be an hour oh

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,690
my gosh how many of you schedule

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,440
meetings and you just default to an hour

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,889
anybody seriously you all do it oh we

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,440
gotta have a full cost an hour why it

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,969
doesn't need to be you can do it for 30

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,710
minutes so I'm trying to make my

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,449
in-person meetings 45 minutes because

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,640
there's no reason to an hour I can gain

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,829
all kinds of time back and I'm trying to

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,360
make my calls 15 to 30 minutes because

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:39,039
again doesn't need to be an hour

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,599
there's nobody setting these rules

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,360
there's all these things that we do what

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,130
I have to do and the last mindset I

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,250
think is the last one we'll see is think

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,990
first wait how many of you okay listen

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,030
let's just be real we're all in thought

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,390
work right we all get paid to

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,860
think is that can we agree on that how

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,790
many of you are getting paid to like dig

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,660
ditches anybody probably not okay

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:07,810
 we're all in thought work but we

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,750
do it without thinking let's just be

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,220
real like you get up in the morning and

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,770
you sit down at your computer and you

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,510
immediately start working and most of

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,330
you start with email which is reactive

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,040
and it's like okay let's do email who's

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,790
yelling at me let me fix their stuff

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,630
first why because that's just what we do

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,130
we don't stop to think what what impact

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,320
would it make on your business in your

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:36,130
life if you carved out I don't know a

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,020
half a day a week a whole half a day to

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:42,070
just think how do I make my business

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:45,940
better what's going well what's not

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,230
going well what am I not seeing do you

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,030
ever ask yourself that like what am I

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,070
not seeing coz there's somebody out

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,530
there that's about to swoop in and do

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,950
something you didn't see and just knock

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,610
you out

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,170
I mean it's myspace vs. facebook myspace

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,150
is looking around like hey I'm king of

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,130
the world and Facebook sneaks right on

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,770
in and who has a myspace account now

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:12,610
like nobody does it even exists anymore

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:14,230
right what am I not seeing right so you

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,210
have to put time to think about that in

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,460
because somebody else is thinking about

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,350
your business somebody else is thinking

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,150
about how to get that client somebody

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,190
else is thinking about how to win at

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,540
what you're trying to do and if you're

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,990
not thinking about it you're gonna lose

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,440
out you're gonna miss schedule time to

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,650
think

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,610
next is habits this is me at the

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,770
Forbidden City

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,470
and one of my habits is taking cat

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,160
selfies because I wear hats all the time

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,260
and I think it's funny that's all that's

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,850
the only real like them I don't get it I

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,190
like people come in like yeah see all

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:53,200
your hat posters are great like okay I'm

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,030
glad you like my eyes and hat but that's

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,190
cool you know let's talk about some

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,800
habits then they let do creative work

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,810
first because if you don't you look like

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,990
that in the afternoon that's me and my

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,220
youngest son on the bus by the way one

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,430
great thing about traveling in China

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,380
with a family of seven is that when you

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,090
book a driver because you just don't

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,090
want to go in taxis there so when you

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,370
book a driver you get a bus we didn't

00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,950
get a car we didn't get a van we got a

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,930
mini bus for our whole family it was

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,730
nuts oh that's me and my youngest son on

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,430
our mini bus hanging out sleeping

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,050
because we were exhausted so do creative

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,120
work first so again back to that idea

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,130
how many of you you sit down get your

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,230
laptop out first thing in the morning

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,210
email response response response

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,520
response response you get to about noon

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm getting kind of hungry let me get

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,530
some food you get past your food and

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,390
then you eat and then you're sleepy and

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,550
then you think oh and I'm gonna write

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,530
that blog post how am I gonna do that I

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,340
don't have any brain power left you

00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:57,760
don't because we forget that creativity

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,980
is a limited resource on a daily basis

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,240
and you've got to do your creative work

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,830
when you can do your creative work

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,780
Nathan talked about this so determine

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,800
and so for you maybe that's like super

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,660
late at night when everyone else to

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,520
sleep for me it's first thing in the

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,320
morning if I'm gonna write if I'm gonna

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,270
record if I'm gonna create if I'm gonna

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,280
think creatively it's got to be the

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,370
first thing I do in the day forget all

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,290
the other stuff email can wait people

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,850
can wait sometimes the kids can't wait

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,010
but you know how that goes right

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,660
everything else can wait I'm gonna do

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,120
the creative stuff first because that's

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,230
the most important contribution I can

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,380
make for that day because there's

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:36,580
certain things as business owners or as

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:39,730
freelancers that only we can do and when

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,080
we only give I don't know 80% of

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,140
ourselves to that creative task later

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,570
honor 70% of ourselves or 50% of

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,950
ourselves in the afternoon or god forbid

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,350
four o'clock when you're just like

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,020
completely checked out it's not your

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,560
best self don't do that do creative work

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,240
first next with 2-minute rules and I try

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,100
to quote stuff like where books they

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,300
came from cuz I didn't create this stuff

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,630
I'm not that intelligent

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,590
I just obsess about this stuff okay so

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,420
so two-minute rules there's two

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,100
two-minute rules that sort of rule my

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,320
world right now okay one two minute the

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,970
first two-minute rule is create new

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,740
habits that are two minutes long so a

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,590
great example is the other day I realize

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,920
hey I really want to write a book but to

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,880
write a book you've got to be a writer

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,980
and to be a writer you have to write a

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,380
lot and then I looked at my day and I'm

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,290
like but I'm not writing that's stupid

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,880
okay so I decided to create the habit

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,200
based on this book of Tomic habits which

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,970
by the way is amazing and you should get

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
and read but I decided I want to create

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,790
a habit of writing every day so I'm

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,770
gonna create the habit of writing for

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,690
two minutes every day so the magic thing

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,640
about this is you create a habit that's

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,560
only two minutes long and you say I'm

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,700
gonna do this every day for two minutes

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,980
and here's the beauty of it number one

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,540
you can't not do something if you're

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,790
only committing to it for two minutes

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,910
like come on two minutes I can do

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,500
anything for two minutes okay so if I

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,120
want to write for two minutes every day

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,800
I can make myself sit down and write for

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,900
two minutes every day the other thing is

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,090
you're always gonna do it for more than

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,150
two minutes like you're gonna start

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,850
writing and like oh I can keep going

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,050
this isn't that bad it's just getting

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,000
over that initial hurdle so if you

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,950
create habits that are 2 minutes long it

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
sort of tricks your brain insane okay

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,530
first of all I don't have any excuse for

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,940
not doing it because it's only two

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,070
minutes and then when you get into it

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,220
you're gonna do more because it's only

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,740
two minutes it's kind of beautiful right

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,750
I love it so that's my new two-minute

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,030
rule it's changing my world the next

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,990
two-minute rule is real old-school from

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,700
David Allen from

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,490
but getting things done if it takes less

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,470
than two minutes you better do it now

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,060
when you get an email and somebody's

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,300
asking you to do something and you think

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,020
I don't want to do that but it's only

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,850
gonna take a minute and a half but just

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,070
be done with it because it takes longer

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,660
to put it off and remember to do it

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,100
later then it doesn't just do it right

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,500
then like think about it if it's a two

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,270
minute task and you've got to write it

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,330
down somewhere and your task management

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,610
software okay so you wrote it down so

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,800
maybe that's it like 30 seconds or 20

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,760
seconds or whatever but then later when

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,140
you look at your task management

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,310
software in a week and a half because it

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,290
was some piddly task you don't want to

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,240
do anyway then you got to remember like

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,740
what was this about and why I'm not

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,660
talking why am I looking at this task

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,950
and then you don't know what it is and

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,160
you have to remind yourself you have to

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,230
read up all that stuff and it takes

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,950
longer just do it takes two minutes like

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,780
just get it done next create routines so

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,130
this may be the best thing I say today

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,530
so if you've been just totally zoned out

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,850
that's cool this next line right here

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,920
you can tweet this this might be

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,900
tweetable I don't know routines are your

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,580
path to consistent productivity that's

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,650
the Great Wall of China and not my

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,300
family because I just I didn't have a

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,090
good picture with my but I did take the

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,460
picture which is cool oh it's a patsy

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,710
you get it right what nobody get right

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,510
so routines are your path to consistent

00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:00,550
productivity so routines deciding every

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,050
morning I'm gonna do this in this order

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,970
for this amount of time every evening

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm gonna do this because here's the

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,480
thing if you don't create create

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,180
routines you are gonna shoot yourself in

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,640
the foot has anybody seen Seinfeld's

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,530
latest Netflix show and he talks about

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,320
like you can't trust night guys anybody

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,520
seen that it's brilliant like it's just

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,810
straight right and because basically

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,330
what he's talking about is like look

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,860
there's night guy that's like hey I'm

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,480
gonna go out I'm gonna party I'm gonna

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,200
have fun I'm gonna binge watch Netflix

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,750
until 3:00 a.m.

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,760
and because it's all about me it's all

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,440
about fun it's night guy and the morning

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,630
guy is the guy that has to pick up the

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,610
pieces of night guy that wakes up you

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,430
know hungover and needs like 15 cups of

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,650
coffee to like survive the day and just

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,660
get by and so my point is you have to

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,640
create a routine because you cannot

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,140
trust night guy night guy does not have

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,769
your best interest in mind

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,319
night guys all about like

00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:54,619
get fun not about getting work done

00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,509
right you can't trust night guy so you

00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:59,329
have to have routines that will allow

00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,829
you to overcome night guy to go to bed

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,449
at a decent hour whatever that looks

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,949
like for you to get the rest that you

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:08,689
need so you can wake up the next day and

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:10,220
crush the day and daily habits so a

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,339
couple daily habits that are big for me

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,720
number one I love this at the start of

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,880
each day just write down three things

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,620
you will do that day absolutely no

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,350
matter what nothing fancy here take out

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,299
a piece of paper and a pen write it down

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,730
what are you gonna do that day that's

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:27,199
gonna make your business better what

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,610
what are you going to complete that day

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,350
that's gonna move the ball for what

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,000
three things only three what three

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,919
things you can complete that day next

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
habit clear out your email and what you

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,830
can do in buck zero if you want I like

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,750
inbox zero some people can't handle it

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,010
about zero but the point is you got to

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,140
make sure all the communication is

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,279
complete every day because if you're

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,120
leaving stuff out there if you're

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,230
leaving people out there they've

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,669
communicated to you

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,020
you haven't communicated back it gets

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:52,580
weird right it just does so so set

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,200
expectations around your inbox make sure

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,240
your that communications circle is

00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,289
complete but as a part of that looks set

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,200
email limits okay like for me my team

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,870
knows all clients have always known I do

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,770
not check email after 5:00 p.m. I don't

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,389
work after 5:00 p.m.

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,039
by the way I do not check email after

00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:11,480
5:00 p.m. I do not check email all the

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,029
weekends I do not work on the weekends

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,850
period ever into story that's it

00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,770
except for maybe like a word camp I just

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,020
don't do it I will not do it because

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,159
work also is like the goldfish it'll

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,529
fill up the time that you give it a snap

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,320
of that Pareto principle I just won't do

00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:29,120
it and you know what happens that means

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,740
that I have to focus on the tasks that

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,510
are the most important and everything

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,830
else just goes by the wayside all the

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,179
stuff that I would have done that I

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,980
probably didn't need to do all of its

00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,570
just gone because I only got a certain

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,340
amount of time because I'm gonna be at

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,200
dinner with my family at 5:15 because we

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,090
eat stupid early because I go to bed

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,830
stupid early because my kids go to bed

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,690
stupid early because I have to have

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,429
sanity okay that's just this would be

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,559
real you got to put into bed so I have

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,059
some sanity in my life right so set

00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,279
email limits whatever those are for you

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,169
like this idea that you have to respond

00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,399
to an email like 10 minutes after you

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:02,059
get it five minutes have to give no no

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,470
no no I checked my email two or three

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,929
times

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,640
that's it you will hear a response from

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,720
me the same day that's all you're gonna

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,010
get it may be ours so you're gonna get

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,630
sétimo limits make sure people know what

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,010
they are I even have a tagline at the

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,059
bottom of my emails that says like hey

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm only checking this a couple times a

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,549
day you'll hear from me shortly I'll get

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,590
back to you today also get everything

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:24,880
out of your head so this idea like I'll

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,280
remember to do that tomorrow you will

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,590
not you won't

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,880
and then you'll tomorrow you'll spend 15

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,710
minutes try remember what you were

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,120
supposed to remember just get it out of

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,429
your head write it down put it somewhere

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,270
have a system for it somewhere we're

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:39,190
gonna talk about that more in a minute

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,950
and then set your stop time and stuff

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,620
this is a big one for me again I set my

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,450
stop time at 5 o'clock if the clock hits

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,950
5 I'm done I don't care what else is

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,570
going on I don't care what's happening

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,059
now if there's some like major event

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,830
there's some website down or a servers

00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,539
out like oh ok I'll jump in I'll help

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,360
out where I can they're like this let's

00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,799
be real but if I'm an email or I'm

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,450
working on a personal project that can

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,090
wait or I'm working on whatever like it

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,130
hits 5 o'clock we're done and what's

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,659
great about that is it forces me to

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,970
prioritize so when I hit 3 o'clock in

00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:11,440
the afternoon sorry I got 2 hours what

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,380
am I going to get done with that 2 hours

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,240
and then I know what I can get done I

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,650
know what to accomplish right so set a

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,390
stop time gives you people that are

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,490
working like till 9 o'clock like with

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,130
this unlimited stop time it means you

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,190
work unlimitedly I don't think that's a

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,809
word it's not good

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,330
all right tactics poly this is my tactic

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:33,640
for the bullet train going from Tallinn

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,590
back to Beijing and our tactic was

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,419
tablets we don't really like screens for

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,380
our kids but you gotta do something with

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,720
a three-year-old when you're in China

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,150
and everybody's super jet-lagged so

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,070
that's our tactics so Nathan talked

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,620
about this this is a big one block

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,289
scheduling just block it out on your

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,450
calendar you know you have a big task to

00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,850
do then go okay so I've got this big

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,059
task it's gonna take me an hour when

00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,669
next week can I commit to doing that no

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,549
matter what put it on the calendar you

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:06,039
know for me like I put like tasks - and

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,740
what the task is so I know like I got a

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,390
call I got a podcast I got a task and

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,590
I'm gonna crush that task right then and

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,630
when it get when it comes time for that

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,820
task it's like an appointment with your

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,990
most important client which is you thank

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,910
you

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:22,320
Nathan schedule it and do it next if you

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,340
need to oh yeah that's it if you need

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
something that's the whole thing sorry

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,350
there's not a next that's it block every

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,480
calendar also group everything this is

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,490
my group that's all I got so it's our

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,920
that's us really happy before we took

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,000
the 12-hour flight dark are the two

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,850
flights to Beijing

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,800
we're all happy at Atlanta hearthstone

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,800
International Airport so so group

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,260
everything group types of tasks together

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,670
like when are you gonna do the same if

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,990
you have the same types of recurring

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,120
castle group them all together also

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,740
group meeting locations this was a huge

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,300
win for me I don't know if any of you

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,800
have done this but like I used to do a

00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,660
ton of meetings and I just bounce all

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,610
over town it's like I'm in Midtown I'm

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,830
in Buckhead I'm downtown I'm everywhere

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,130
and it would take forever to get there

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,480
and then I thought this is stupid so now

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,300
it's like alright I've got a I've got a

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,880
Midtown day I've got a Buckhead day and

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,559
then like maybe I'll set up like a once

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,390
a month you know downtown day or

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,460
something like that and every meeting I

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,320
have I schedule in those slots it's like

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,760
alright so where's your office oh you're

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,840
in Midtown I got to come to you ok well

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,850
my next Midtown day is this Thursday do

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,010
you anytime that day I got these times

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,380
oh you don't have those times no problem

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,450
my next Midtown day is like the next

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,190
month can we now obviously if it's a

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,620
client you're trying to land a deal ok

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,000
like you gotta go and you gotta go I get

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,470
that I do the same thing it's a big

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,630
client I'll show up where wherever

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,250
you're at we'll go there I even went

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,559
down to Orlando recently just to land

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:51,020
like listen I'll be there they still

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,020
turn me down I'm a little bitter it's ok

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,690
but the group it all together right put

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,550
it all and then calls like put your

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,780
calls together just just bounce them

00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,520
together back to back to back to back

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,140
you know and also just a word of the

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,000
wise if you are doing a bunch of calls I

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,700
recommend at least 10 minutes in between

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,410
to make some notes in like breeze like

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,000
make notes breathe you know bio breaks

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,620
coffee more coffee

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,510
those are good things so calls are great

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,550
grouping everything together and then

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,870
lastly have a system product not lastly

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,150
have a system process for everything so

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,920
this is all of our backpacks so when we

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,420
did take all of our kids to China you

00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,309
know five kids and the seven of us we

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,510
only switch backpacks which people

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,740
thought we were totally nuts because

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,570
we're in China for a week you can only

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,060
do one backpack per person and that's

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,730
what we did it was great

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,930
you have to have a system for everything

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,550
so I created a whole system for our

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,110
backpacks right that's how we do it so

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,610
you have to have a task system what's

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,010
your system for this what's your process

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,800
how do you think about it so for me it's

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,970
a combination of calendar todoist I love

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,410
to do this to anybody else used to do

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,510
this to do this is great app yeah really

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,120
good okay to do this it's cut to do us

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,610
and not really just those two things for

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,400
me for tasks for meetings again it's

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,110
locations I also set aside times for

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,850
phone calls during the week so I have

00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,960
specific times that I do phone calls

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,190
specific times that I do meeting

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,920
specific locations that I do meetings

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,690
work have a system for how you're going

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,550
to get work done went like like Nathan

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,740
talked about when are the times that are

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,540
going to be dedicated only to projects

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,090
one of the times that are gonna be

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,200
dedicated only to sales one of the times

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,830
they're gonna be dedicated only to

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,970
marketing for yourself can we be honest

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,410
like we don't do that right we don't

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,150
dedicate marketing time for ourselves

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,880
very much like let's just be real like

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:29,510
it it gets chef to the back and how

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,860
great would it be if we did it right you

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,770
also need systems you need to automate

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,840
or systematize as much as you possibly

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,610
can great example that I've got a

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,430
podcast good people good marketing by

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,560
the way as a side note podcasts are a

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,850
really great tool for business lead

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,590
generation I'll read a blog post about

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,720
it on sideways ENCOM it's gonna check it

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,550
out you can I told you how to do

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,540
everything I gave away my entire system

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,390
so if you wanna check it out

00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,300
have at it but I've got a whole system

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,370
for that so basically my role in the

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,200
podcast process is record with the

00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,520
guests and then I've got several things

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,440
automated with a guest scheduled

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
themselves and then I've also got team

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,680
members that have specific tasks that

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,030
they take care of along the way so that

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,410
I can keep moving forward so I've got

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,420
I've got virtual assistants looped in

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,650
and automations through like calendly

00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,480
and things like that so I've got a whole

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,190
process in place that just makes a

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,870
podcast run really really smoothly

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,390
really quick so I can record you know

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,920
five six episodes in one day no big deal

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,770
and then everything sort of gets taken

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,660
care of on the backend alright lastly

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,350
this is a method that I honestly just

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,110
totally made up

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,270
so maybe good or maybe not Nathan's

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,160
method may be very maybe better but this

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,050
is we do a five five five method for

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,210
sideways eight so the idea is lay out

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,370
five goals each year that are going to

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,350
move your business towards your ultimate

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,710
goal okay five goals each so that's the

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,910
correct

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,590
for the goals right move your business

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,540
toward the ultimate goal five goals each

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,430
year five goals for each month and then

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,930
five goals for each week and then we

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,750
break those down into three things you

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:56,150
absolutely will do that week no matter

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,740
what and then if one of our team members

00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,940
doesn't do it we asked why because

00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,560
there's got to be accountability and

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,580
then too pie-in-the-sky tasks like hey

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,620
would be great if I could get to this

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,600
and then you never do because come on

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,520
right it's a pilot nobody gets the

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,560
pie-in-the-sky task everybody gets stuff

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,150
going on so I did write a blog post

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,650
about that by the way if you want to

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,540
take a look that explains the whole

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,730
thing we do it all in a Google sheet

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,120
it's super simple easy to keep up with

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,050
it's great and that is my whole talk I

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,450
told you it would take about thirty

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:26,420
minutes and I think I'm at about 28 so

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:32,540
now we got some time for Q&A also just

00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:34,610
quick oh thank you kind of quick notes

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:38,060

about it today please we're doing a

00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,810
nonprofit drive right now and we really

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,790
desperately need nonprofits design up so

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:05,810
and now it's time for some questions so

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:07,970
did you have a question sign up there

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,810
you go one more nonprofit here we go

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,810
alright yes sir

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:19,160
excuse me win or what drove you to do

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,740
all this organization and really really

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,270
streamline us the way you have sheer

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,560
necessity and in frailness of my mind no

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,150
I mean honestly like it's been something

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,500
I've obsessed about ever since I've read

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,120
David Allen's book getting things done

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,550
probably 10 years ago

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,790
and it's always spiraling in the back of

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,580
my mind and then as I have a bad habit

00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:42,620
of adding more things to my plate it

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,880
becomes even more necessary which

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,790
actually it's kind of great hunt to be

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,410
honest like I I love adding things to my

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,150
plate because it makes me focus that

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,539
much more intensely on the things that

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,580
only I can do in every other

00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:57,809
area which is which is kinda great all

00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:01,019
right else we got we're doing Mike sir

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,269
yeah just shout it out that's fine so my

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,489
next question right here hello

00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:09,330
thank you okay bye my question was about

00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:11,369
your five five five yep do you guys set

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,779
those as a team or do you assign them

00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:14,700
and then I wanted to hear a little bit

00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,919
more about the accountability with it

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,379
yeah so we did a Google sheet each

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,229
person sets their own and there is the

00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:23,970
assumption that if your sucks that we

00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:26,129
can challenge you on it and tell you it

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,369
sucks and then honestly the

00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:31,259
accountability is is if you don't get it

00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,029
done for the week we highlight it in

00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:34,529
bright red so that everybody knows that

00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:37,349
you didn't get it done and it's public

00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,849
shaming so actually I highlighted one of

00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,529
mine in her head for last week to be

00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,759
quite honest but then you have agreed if

00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,590
you did get it done and then you feel

00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,440
really good about yourself so but public

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,700
shaming works really well honestly yeah

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,729
what are some of your favorite

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,799
productivity apps or tools and how do

00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:56,279
you also deal with it if you're one of

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,440
those people who hypothetically thrives

00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,200
on being busy and having a full to-do

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,659
list and gets almost more anxious

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,450
relaxing yeah that's a great question so

00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,359
tools to duyst is a big one also our

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,029
team's use teamwork which is great and

00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,489
then Trello is pretty amazing as well we

00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:16,970
use that for 40 and 40 quite a bit and

00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:19,320
and for those that thrive on business so

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,720
free to fill hurts for her Nathan say or

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,039
something else but business is not a

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,169
badge of honor so I think you have to be

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,210
careful about identifying with busyness

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:28,200
as success and I think that's the

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,359
problem with our culture is we

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,249
identified busyness as success so when

00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,019
somebody says like hey how are you you

00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:36,599
say I'm busy in that way they think that

00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,970
you're successful and in reality I don't

00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,830
think that's true at all and so I but I

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,289
think for those of you that just need

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,429
your stuff you don't like downtime like

00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,320
that's fine you don't have to have

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:49,019
downtime you can have you know organized

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,279
you know productive downtime right but

00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:51,840
it's just it's this idea of frantic

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,820
busyness that I think we have to get

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,649
past if that makes sense because I'm the

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,659
same way like I I want to know what I'm

00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,879
doing like I want to keep going but I

00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,870
don't want to be busy that makes sense

00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:03,900
yeah

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:06,840
um so you said use teamwork and Trello

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,940
and those are good ways to do like the

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,460
task management what do you do about

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,410
getting your processes documented and

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,600
your roles and responsibilities and kind

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:20,100
of the higher level of business process

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,380
mapping we're getting better at that we

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,510
use a lot of Google Docs so we have a we

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,030
have a we have a defined process for

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,100
creating processes that fortunately I

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,630
did not even create somebody else on our

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,980
team created it and it's fantastic I

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,510
think Julie might have created it

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,880
actually Julie's right here so you can

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,290
maybe ask Julie later oh but but I mean

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,790
we we have a process for creating

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,990
processes and we walk through that and

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,760
like here's how this works

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,830
so everything is legitimately mapped out

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
in a way that is scalable because if

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,460
we're all honest we want to grow our

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,809
businesses and the reality is you cannot

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,400
grow your business unless you have

00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,500
processes in place you just can't do it

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
no it's just not feasible okay well

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,520
who's next

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,070
something else I'm Mike yep hi what do

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,929
you do how did you get so that you could

00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,929
do calendar blocking and like follow

00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:05,640
your calendar because I hate calendar

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,940
blocking and everybody says calendar

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,250
blocking and it makes me crazy cuz I'm

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:16,530
defiant and my calendar will not tell me

00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:17,880
what to do yeah so I honestly the best

00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,220
thing you do in my mind is

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,710
accountability so I try to be

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,140
accountable both to my team and also to

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,190
mentors and so like so there are certain

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,950
things in my life that are super

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,360
important to me that I hate one of those

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,210
is getting up at 5:00 a.m. every day

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,290
like I am like people think oh you get

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,640
up at 5:00 a.m. every day you're a

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,080
morning person no I'm not a morning

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,929
person I hate morning's mornings are the

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,690
worst I'll kill you okay

00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:45,660
but I yeah there yeah but I have a

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,090
mentor and friend and I text him every

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,190
single day that I get up and if I don't

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,530
get up at 5:00 a.m. he bust my chops and

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,820
because I know that's what's best for me

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,200
right so the same thing I would I would

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,400
get a mentor in a heartbeat a friend

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,840
accountability partner somebody like

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,330
that yep hey Adam I was in the session

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,520
that you did 48 and 48 a couple of years

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:09,120
ago when you just kicked it off sure

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,720
it's on glad that it carried on what

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,340
criteria are you do the charities need

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,799
to reach a certain or

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,580
simple real simple criteria so every

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,159
charity for 1448 three things 501c3 so

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,860
you know non-profit 501 it's actually a

00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,929
non-profit to under three million dollar

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,029
revenue per year because over three

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,500
million there tights tend to be too

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,429
complex and they should probably just

00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,500
have a budget and three let's see oh

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,570
generally non-religious non-political

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,130
what I mean by that is so like if

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,289
there's a soup kitchen that means out of

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,640
a church basement that's fine but we're

00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,779
not going to do what's it for like a

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
place of worship because we don't want

00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:48,720
to end up in that awkward situation

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,520
where we have somebody of one religion

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,649
building a website to promote a

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,370
different religion that's weird so we're

00:32:52,649 --> 00:33:00,120
not gonna put somebody in that position

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:02,370
right yep um so you talked about doing

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,309
the creative work first but I've noticed

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,929
when I do my creative stuff first like I

00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:10,940
like doing in the morning I kind of

00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:14,100
forget I still have to actually work so

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,919
how do you how do you manage that like

00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,840
doing your creative tasks first but then

00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,390
being able to actually work on the stuff

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,929
you do actually need to finish I find it

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,730
really helpful to take to do things

00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:29,730
that'll reset my day a little bit so

00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,600
like hop up do like so for me like I'll

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,409
actually do a lot of creative work

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,779
sometimes like 6:00 in the morning

00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,130
because that's when my kids are still

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,559
sleeping in the house is actually quiet

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,970
for once and like I could like think and

00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,860
stall like I'll do that but then I'll

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,690
have my breakfast like after that so

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,010
sort of almost like resets my day so I

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,690
can sort of get started or like same

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,039
thing in the afternoon like I've gotten

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,059
a bunch stuff done in the morning I've

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,470
eaten lunch I'm getting to that

00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,450
sluggishness like go take a ten-minute

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,399
walk get out in the sunshine like reset

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,909
my mind a little bit and then I can come

00:33:53,399 --> 00:34:00,059
back and start doing some actual work

00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:01,500
yep yeah um quick question um one of the

00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,620
things I'm kind of running into is

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,299
planning and making sure that I'm

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,159
planning my time accordingly for each

00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,909
day especially for each week so I can

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,149
make sure I'm getting a task

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,820
accomplished - I guess a two-part

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,830
question one is it one of those things

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,629
for me is it better to kind of plan in

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,820
the morning or at night work right

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:24,929
before you go to bed and - how long

00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,310
should you plan it's I think it depends

00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,230
right so first of all uh so I think

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,629
every week you should plan for the next

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,210
we generally write so every mutt like so

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:34,500
I have a mentor that said once a day

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,790
plan your perfect day once a week

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,169
playing a perfect week once a month

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,330
plain imperfect month and every once in

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,100
a while playing your perfect lifetime

00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,290
he's pretty brilliant so that's that's

00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,639
really what I try to adhere to so as far

00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,169
as time goes I mean so planning your

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,429
week probably takes a little longer

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,020
I'd like give yourself a good hour to

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,090
plan your week but for planning like

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,139
your day planning tomorrow I mean a lot

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,520
of times if you plan your week well

00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,950
planning tomorrow's 5 minutes 10 minutes

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,530
you know really really short as far as

00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:01,080
when you should do it for me I do not at

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,300
when 5 o'clock comes I'm off I'm done I

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,090
do not want to think about work I am dad

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,230
mode full-out I am NOT I don't want to

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,590
come back to work I'm just not going to

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,480
do it

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,830
so I would never plan a night personally

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,359
some people they can't go to sleep

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,950
unless they plan tomorrow and that's

00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,420
fine like if that's how you're wired you

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,780
can do that I just for me I'm not gonna

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,109
do that

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,420
that makes sense all right over here

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:24,210
same spot there's like the popular table

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,250
for questions we all kind of figure out

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,210
what we want to ask you um quick

00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,390
question then like a follow-up question

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,950
so 5 o'clock during the week you're done

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,960
do you work on the weekends at all

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,720
nope no okay so when do you find time

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,310
for that like intense extreme focus to

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,200
really drive the needle for are you just

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,540
booking that throughout the day yep I

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,390
try to do it on Mondays ok so my goal is

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,560
that so we typically will do some like

00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,150
team kickoff meetings early in the

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,160
mornings on Mondays and then I try to

00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,560
lock down from there and all Monday

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,119
morning up and up until just after lunch

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,730
or just at lunch just like my time to

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,470
like really plan think okay kind of last

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,600
thing there with that do you actually

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,859
block that time out your team knows not

00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,240
to bother you during that time is that

00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:06,420
how that how you've done that well well

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,980
then I just ignore them I mean I mean

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,900
this mean honestly I mean like like

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,670
slack is great listen slack is awesome

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,810
but you got to have dark times like

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,700
we've started doing this with our teams

00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,380
like like you gotta have times where you

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,500
know you can go dark and nobody's gonna

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,420
scream at you and in in cept whatever

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,650
those times happen to be and so my team

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,460
knows like I'm gonna go dark sometimes

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:28,740
and it's okay yeah absolutely yep

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,440
how do you manage your creative time

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,390
because I find myself sometimes doing my

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,630
creative work and I get so caught up

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,300
that my time goes by and I forget to

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,559
even eat lunch so tell us so how do you

00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,900
manage that yeah the worst is when

00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:46,380
you're doing that and then you go oh I

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,329
got a call thirty minutes ago me and so

00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,130
I actually set timers like I said like

00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:51,990
all day long like I'm like I look at my

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,640
calendar and I'm like oh okay

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,430
alright I've got a podcast interview in

00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,630
30 minutes in light even in those 30

00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,160
minutes like I'll just completely lose

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,599
circuit time so I'll set a timer for 25

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,010
minutes so when that timer goes off I

00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,490
know oh crap I got actually do something

00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,349

loss not that I necessarily have fat to

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,520

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:21,240
favourite organizational tools that you

00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:25,020

todoist is awesome those are the big

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,780
ones for me

00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:34,870
yeah I can't think of any other ones

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,060
that are big

00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,550
I'm a big audible listener I'm trying to

00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,140
listen to 35 books this year I listen to

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,490
a read 35 books this year so I'm all

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,530
about audible like listening while I'm

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:48,280
in the car which is great now look up

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:53,530
the atomic canvas what anybody else that

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,900
it yes there's a lot of atomic habits is

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,400
amazing never split the difference if

00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,700
you've heard that about negotiation oh

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,380
my gosh so great so so good there's like

00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,510
15 others that are not immediately

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,920
coming to tell my head now Charles

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,150
Duhigg stuff is really good yeah I do

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,440
blog about the books that I've read yeah

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,630
often blog about those that would be a

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:16,570
good place to check them out as well

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:19,180
what's that I would see those off to

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,330
read those okay nice I'm all about that

00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,410
I love it

00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,470
then tomorrow I haven't read that one

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,470
either

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,099
[Music]

00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,540
that's tough and I think honestly it's

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,099
gonna depend on how aggressive you want

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,809
to be right so client work is always

00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:49,660
going to beget client work and it's and

00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,770
it's gonna be a slow grow right and then

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,079
and that's just how it happens like

00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,329
business is momentum and business growth

00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:56,440
is momentum and if you if it's if it's

00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,819
if you're a hundred percent client work

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,099
it probably will grow but it's gonna be

00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:02,319
slow if it's 80 percent client work and

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:04,119
20 percent like go get them sales it's

00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,710
gonna grow faster and so you've got to

00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,880
figure out like so I don't I don't know

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,220
there's a magic number for that it's

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,859
just a question of like what can you do

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,480
in light and how can you like I mean so

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:15,609
I would ask you the question like how

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,119
much client work can you afford to only

00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:20,410
do so like for example if your compat

00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,180
Aksumite of dollars per month that means

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,380
I've got to do client work for 70% of

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,540
the time per month then there's your

00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,670
number 70% and the other 30% is growth

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,309
growth growth growth growth but but it's

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,240
gonna be different for every person

00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:42,730
there's somebody else over there have a

00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:44,260
question yep sure go rut tough yeah Gio

00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,240
are uck

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:50,589
tough it's crazy you should do it it's

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,170
awesome yeah could you explain the do

00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:55,839
less thing again like I kind of got it

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,010
but I didn't get it like hope you do

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,390
last thing is this like so

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,359
so we're marketers or we're

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:04,119
businesspeople and we get distracted by

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,609
shiny objects a lot right and new ideas

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,260
but the reality of that is like we spend

00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:10,960
all this time on these shiny objects or

00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,970
new ideas that we could spend doing

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,130
something that's much more effective for

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,839
our business right so a great example of

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,400
that is like okay well I know that I

00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,660
need to run Google Ads for my business

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,420
I've already got the targeted audience

00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,890
built and it's gonna affect my bike

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,210
that's gonna directly impact my business

00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,290
I know I need to do that but I don't

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,849
really want to do that because that's no

00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,839
fun so I'm gonna go over here and do

00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:31,240
something else I want to write a blog

00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:32,530
post or do our podcast that's fun which

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,849
is also important but that's a slow

00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,470
grower model right that's it it's gonna

00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:37,210
take more time for that to how effect

00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,890
then for this direct thing over here to

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,920
have effect and so we spend a lot of our

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:43,569
time doing things that don't necessarily

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,030
have the most impact for our business

00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:48,130
and so my point is drop the stuff that

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,359
you're doing that's not having a direct

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,570
and effective impact on your business

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,520
and pick it up later

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,200
you know put it on pause for a month and

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:59,980
if it if you miss it come back to it and

00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:04,200
otherwise don't you know anybody else

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:07,550
all right then I guess we're done

00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,550
