Title: Frank Corso: Getting Started with Google Analytics
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Imagine a website that is getting 1000 users a day. Now imagine that about 50 of them are spending money on the site. You probably want to get more of the users that are spending money on the site but how do you know where these users are coming from? Maybe you know that all of them are coming from Twitter or Facebook but do you know which post or tweet refers the most people who actually convert to customers? Or, how do you know how many signed up to receive your lead magnet? This is where analytics comes in.
In this talk, we will discuss:
How to see where your users are coming from
What pages/posts your users most spend time on
What actions your users do on your website
What UTM codes are and how to use them
How to see exactly which links in your marketing drives the most traffic and conversions
And much more!

good afternoon everyone how's everyone

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,279
doing they're they're running and trying

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,810
to get the screen right so we're just

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,919
gonna go and get started and and wing

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,780
with it while they're working on the

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,300
screen and that way we don't lose any

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,260
time out so welcome to getting started

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,300
with Google Analytics has it how many

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,760
people use Google Analytics already just

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,340
saying kind of gauge okay awesome great

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,350
job so before we get started a real

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,460
quick about me that's me that's my

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,810
daughter she's actually sitting in the

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,840
back she comes with me to all these

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,090
events so I am the developer of a

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,590
plug-in called WP health and I'm also an

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,850
adjunct professor at the University of

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,559
Florida where I teach web development

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:45,960
and I'm the co-organizers herbivore Camp

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:47,489
Jacksonville so before we get into

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,440
things I want to briefly talk about what

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,860
is analytics for those that don't use

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,860
any analytics yet so analytics as a way

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,149
to determine how what pages are being

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,670
viewed the most and what actions are

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,879
being taken on your page so analytics at

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,320
the most basic level every time someone

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,570
loads a page that has Google Analytics

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
on it Google Analytics calls a URL and

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,640
it sends a little bit of data it's

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,460
called a hit

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,619
so this hit sends over what browser the

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,450
users using what page they're viewing

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,400
what actions they might have taken on

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,049
the page what language their browsers

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,880
are sitting in this this hit happens

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,860
every time the page is loaded so that's

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,560
how analytics work at a very basic level

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,540
the page gets loaded a hit gets sent to

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,869
a URL that's Google Analytics owns and

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,299
it sends some data about the user now in

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,290
in the world so that's pretty much what

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,729
I just said we're gonna scoot to the

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,619
next slide here there's actually many

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,460
many different analytics platforms you

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,049
might have heard a couple of these

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,130
there's Google Analytics which we're

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,130
gonna talk about there's clicky

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,810
there's mix panel down here box panel

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,090
there's fathom KISSmetrics

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,860
there's a lot of other analytic

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,149
platforms out there we're talking about

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,829
Google Analytics because it's not only

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,600
the most popular but it's also free and

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,430
I like free and probably most of you

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
like free and Google Analytics if you

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,810
ever go to try to get advertisement or

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,549
affiliates or try to sell your site

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,259
people will tend to trust Google

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,810
Analytics data more than some of the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,250
lesser-known analytic platforms if

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,720
you're using some of these they're still

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,190
at the top tier of goo analytics but you

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,660
find some of the the lesser-known ones

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,650
they might not trust that data as much

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,360
as Google Analytics

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,060
that's why most people start with Google

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,989
Analytics now you can even keep playing

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,989
with it I'm just going to keep running

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,180
warrior alright so there's a there's

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,310
three different definitions that you

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,769
want to know before you really jump into

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,720
any analytic platform so within in

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,700
Google Analytics you have your Google

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,890
Analytics account so this is something

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,849
you use to log in your Gmail your Google

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,700
Calendar wherever you have Google

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,959
Analytics any Google account you have

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,610
your Google account that you log into

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,250
well inside Google Analytics there's

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,230
also an account in there and inside

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,519
there you can have multiple accounts so

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,769
think of this as like your business

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,209
account and if you take on clients so

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,890
maybe you're a freelancer or you're

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,780
marketer you have a different account

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,299
inside Google Analytics for each of your

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,489
clients so if you run two businesses you

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,500
might have two accounts one for each of

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,989
your businesses they're both inside your

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,569
one Google Analytics account and then

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,760
inside that account there's something

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,299
called properties and what properties

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,060
are are individual sites or individual

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,190
apps within that account so maybe you

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,540
have your you have your marketer and/or

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,190
you're a business owner who has two

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,720
accounts in there so I have two accounts

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,459
and then inside each of those accounts

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,669
you might have a property and that's the

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,560
website so so for example we're going to

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,150
look at a Google annex in just a minute

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,650
but I have inside there I have an

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,120
account called Corso industries which is

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,379
one of my companies and inside there we

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
have a property for one of my websites

00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,500
and then I have another property for

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,780
another one of the websites underneath

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,010
that company or you have two accounts

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,180
and maybe for two different clients and

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,440
then each of those might have only a

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,599
single property that is a single website

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,400
now inside there let's that's why you

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,919
you guys keep grindin we'll keep going

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,090
so inside the properties and this if

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,199
this is a little confusing will make

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,299
sense once we look at Google Analytics

00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,609
so just trust me it'll make sense once

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,889
we get there but inside the properties

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,720
there's something called views so

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,459
essentially how Google Analytics work is

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,290
every time that hit gets fired and it

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,819
gets sent in that data gets sent into

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,410
Google Analytics and it looks through

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,940
the views that are part of the property

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,699
and determine where do we need to

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,789
collect this data so normally there is a

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,470
view called raw data or all website data

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,699
and pretty much everything you need it's

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,979
going to go in that view but you could

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,450
create other views to focus on other

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,969
things so you can have a view that only

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,389
shows traffic that was people were

00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:29,039
referred from

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,939
social media and then every time you

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,520
look at it's only going to be people

00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,879
from social media or you can have a view

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,740
that is only mobile browsers so it's

00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,939
only going to have data relevant for for

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,710
people who's viewing your website on

00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,060
your mobile phone and these are a

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,499
variety of views that you can play with

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,539
and even better you can have different

00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:47,909
filters which we'll get to later on or

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,439
you can have hey this view don't have me

00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,090
included in the data and don't have any

00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,830
spam bots don't have anything like that

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,400
so you know a view set up for different

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,400
purposes

00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:04,439
the one we're clicking on whenever you

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:08,159
get to is the one on the top left now

00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,389
once we get past those the account the

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,860
property and view does that make sense

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,240
the account property view how those are

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,219
different does anyone have a question on

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,900
that before we now okay so once we get

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:20,819
to the actual data there's a few other

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,650
definitions we want to talk about one is

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,740
the difference between user and session

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,900
so a user is a unique person who comes

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,020
see your website so if I go to your

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,789
website I will be counted as one user

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,680
Google Analytics knows this because when

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:37,020
I load the webpage it's gonna put a

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
cookie in my browser so the next time I

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,919
go to it'll go hey there's that cookie

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
there this is a returning user so if I

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,529
clear my cookies or I switch to

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,599
different browser or go to a different

00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,949
phone I'll be counted as a second user

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,930
when I go to your site and not a

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,240
returning user so something to remember

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,039
users it's usually counted as one I'm a

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,469
single user but it's based off of

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,750
cooking in my browser so if I clear my

00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:59,129
cookies or if I'm in incognito mode or

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,460
anything along those lines then I could

00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:03,599
be counted as multiple users now inside

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,569
there there's something called a session

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,710
now a session is what the time that I'm

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,689
on your website so if I go to your

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,129
website today and I go through your site

00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,169
go to view all your pages maybe buy

00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,610
something and then I leave that is my

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,259
one session everything I did in there is

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,969
in one session if I come back next week

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,589
and do some other things that's a

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:21,389
separate session so I've had two

00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,849
different sessions on your site even

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,250
though I'm one user something to

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,229
remember a session is counted it stops

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,300
counting after 30 minutes of inactivity

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,370
so if I'm on your website and I'm doing

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,830
some cool stuff and then I leave and

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,269
then it will wait 30 minutes and then if

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,379
I don't come back or do anything then

00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,120
it's going to go okay that's the end of

00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,199
this session so in the morning time if

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,100
I'm on your site doing some cool stuff

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,660
and I get

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,520
tract it and I'd go away for 30 minutes

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,200
and then I come back it'll restart a

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,240
second then they don't have two sessions

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,070
during that day so that's something too

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,480
you can't change that I don't recommend

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,980
going that because everything else all

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,450
the math in the world is based off that

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,820
30-minute so I don't recommend that but

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,950
so that just just be aware that it's the

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,510
cut-offs usually thirty minutes so

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:09,660
that's user that session do you have a

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:10,740
question on it just a neck so you go so

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,390
maybe you have videos on your website

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,430
and someone goes to your website and

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,540
there and you have this hour-long video

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,980
and they click play and they watch the

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,060
whole thing well by the time they do

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,320
something else on your website it'll be

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,120
a second session because they'll be

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,130
considered inactive so in that case you

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,810
might want to change the default but

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,190
it's just 30 minutes of inactivity so

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,660
they're just sitting on your page maybe

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,190
a really long page we have a book or

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,320
something that's taking a long time to

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,700
consume it could so cut off the session

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:40,700
if it's in act if they're not getting

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:40,700
hits in yes you have a question okay

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,110
mmm-hmm in most cases we'll count you

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,800
twice there's some newer things coming

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,699
out where there's cross browser user

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,710
we're not going to touch on that in this

00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,940
song but by default it would count you

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,199
twice because you're in two different

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,690
browsers with two different browser

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,460
cookies but Google Analytics is working

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,810
on I'm not going to get into its is more

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,819
advanced but essentially there will be

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,470
ways that you could have it set up as

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:17,759
one user but by default it'd be two

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:23,639
different users all right so did you

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:27,120
close out okay so you did it'll be the

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:39,990
one in the top left once it opens up yes

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:41,880
do you have a question yeah yes most of

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,810
the syncing some depending on the

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,070
browser depending on the settings

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,649
there's third Friday but most browsers

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,330
would sink like history and cookie or

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,130
history and bookmarks and things like

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,899
that they don't always sync the cookies

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:59,420
so in that case a one in apply X it's

00:08:51,899 --> 00:09:02,100
the browser cookie that's important okay

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,209
we're just gonna switch this way so I'm

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,250
not gonna sit here and try to yeah I

00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:13,110
have the PDF already downloaded just in

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:16,920
case so we can so it is this one right

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,060
there if you want to see so there's this

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,399
if you want to try it there but if not

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:25,380
you know there's a PDF okay so after

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,579
that there's two other definitions we

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,459
wanna talk about before we actually look

00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:32,040
at Google Analytics so the next is the

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,870
page view and the event so by default

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,640
mostly everything we talked about so far

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,320
as I page view so if someone lands on a

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,880
page and they view your page that's

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,680
considered one page view they go to a

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,170
different page that's a page a different

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,270
page view of that other page so if I I

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,459
mean I'm one user and I have one session

00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,209
and I view five different pages it'll be

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,770
five page views during that session an

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,230
event is an action I take on your

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,760
website so you can track some of the

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,030
actions I take on your website so maybe

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,040
you have a video and I

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,740
click Play and then I watch the whole

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,390
video or I posit halfway through or I

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,220
download a PDF they on your website or I

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,470
make a transaction I purchase something

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,660
those are all events that you can also

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,950
track inside Google Analytics so this

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,960
would be a separate thing from page

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,030
views page view by default is the only

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,860
thing it collects by default and that

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,050
would be just me going through web pages

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,820
but you can set up event tracking so you

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,620
can also track some of the actions that

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:29,770
are taking on the website does that sort

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,900
of make sense so impression page views

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,580
that it's mostly there's some nuance

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,550
there but for our purposes it's pretty

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,740
much the same all right

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,660
so we're running out of definitions to

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,800
go over so hopefully we're almost at the

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,360
point that we can go into Google

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,130
Analytics but there's so there's three

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,550
ones left so you have three definitions

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,870
so we could so in the sets of the funnel

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,090
you might be aware something called a

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,980
marketing funnel so essentially you have

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,330
no matter what kind of website you have

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,590
you probably want people to come view

00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,940
your website and there's probably some

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,190
action you want them to take on your

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,050
website whether it's sign up for your

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,940
mailing lists or buy a product there's

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,950
something along those lines so this in

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,640
marketing there's this funnel of people

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,110
that you're trying to get attention

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,370
people that are on your website and

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,440
people are doing the thing you want them

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,970
to do so this is the concept of funnel

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,490
and go analytics they have this same

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,420
process and it looks like we're almost

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:29,190
there okay that's not what I'm using I'm

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:29,190
using the other piece awesome

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,080
thank you gentlemen

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,850
so this in Google Enix this is how they

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,890
view the funnel they use these three

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,529
terms acquisition behavior and

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,050
conversion so acquisition is how users

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,959
are getting to your site behavior is

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,700
what they are doing on your site and

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,000
conversion is users who are completing

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,290
the actions you want them to take so

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,940
I'll let you take a moment to take a

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:03,810
picture and then we'll switch back can

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:05,070
you everyone get what they needed yes I

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,899
will have the slides I actually have the

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:14,279
URL for the sites in these slides say

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:16,350
you'll you'll get at the end is everyone

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,029
good so just in case you wanted the last

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,779
couple pictures or just wanted to see

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,339
how these worked out

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,570
this was the account property of you

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,040
that kind of go within each other in

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,480
case you missed that and these slides

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
will be available so you don't need to

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,170
take pictures of every site if you don't

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,700
need to and then in case you miss

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,950
anything I was talking there it was user

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,029
sessions page views and events did

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,470
everyone understand the difference of

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,540
all these definitions before we get to

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,010
the actual data because that's it's this

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,570
is the backbone of Google Analytics so

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,950
you really need to understand these

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,839
concepts as ever you want does anyone

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,900
have a question on any of these these

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,880
couple of slides here ok awesome so

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,760
let's take a look around and we are not

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,620
on a laptop that's logged in that's fine

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,040
that's fine I counted for this I have

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,540
screenshots in case it didn't work so so

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,860
when you log in to Google Analytics

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,089
we're not going to get to play with all

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,490
of its I'm not logged in on this laptop

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,170
but I have screenshots as backup so when

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,020
you log in you'll have this left sidebar

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,640
that divides in the same concept there's

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,779
acquisition right here there's behavior

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,300
right underneath that as act is

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,920
conversion so those three tabs will line

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,390
up with this funnel so what you're

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,230
looking for if you're going hey I want

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,270
to know how people are getting to my

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,770
website that's acquisition you'll go to

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,360
the acquisition tab if you're looking

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,339
for hey what are the people doing on my

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,959
website that'll be underneath behavior

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,310
if you're looking at hey what are the

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,870
conversions people who bought from my

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,520
site how did they get here you look at

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,089
conversion so those are the three terms

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,550
you'd want to remember and that lines up

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,110
exactly with this little guy over here

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,700
this acquisition and behavior and then

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,860
writing rate this would be conversion

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,600
so when you first sign in there's

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,800
depending on how you set up who

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,940
analytics there might be a few different

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,740
things you might see when you first log

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,680
in but by default you might be on this

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,300
real-time tab unless you really know

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,580
Google Analytics I advise you don't even

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,740
play with this tab use it for checking

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,540
make sure oh okay I'm on my site I show

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,430
up I know it's working but on that I've

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,380
I've met people who spent I leave this

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,730
have open pretty much all day and others

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,230
watch out there someone was saying oh

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,000
there's someone on my website what are

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,290
they doing oh they're on this page well

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,090
at the end of the day that actually

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,770
means nothing to you you're not going to

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,340
take any actions from that you're just

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,510
wasting time so don't don't fall in the

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,100
trap of playing on this page it's really

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,180
cool it's nice for testing if you're

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,130
trying to do something and make sure it

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,180
works but own that don't don't play with

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,660
this unless you really know what you're

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,700
doing so from there there's the audience

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,960
along the left so real time is what I

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,490
was just on right underneath that is

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,470
audience in there's where you can get

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,300
some demographic information about the

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,800
people that are on your site so what

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,930
language they're set up their browsers

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,420
in what operating systems if they're on

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,230
a phone or a tablet a variety of things

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,710
such as that

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,270
if you synced up advertising features

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,950
which will might go over at the end of

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,420
paying on time then underneath some of

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,070
these other options down here you could

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,810
even get some interests and some age

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,330
range information that's only if you've

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,230
turned on those options though but so

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:03,300
audience is about your users next

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,650
acquisition then that's the next part

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,500
that's that very top part of the funnel

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,730
is how people are getting to my website

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,890
so you'll see something like this when

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,170
you first jump on and then you'll have

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,880
these acquisition channels so by default

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,100
Google knows if something is coming from

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,530
social media in those cases they know of

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,900
someone's coming by referral so if

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,430
someone mentions you on their website or

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,860
they link to you somewhere that's that

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,930
would be a referral they also track

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,580
search so maybe if someone searches for

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,840
you and they you show up in the search

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,180
listings and they get to your website

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,100
but they don't track by default

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,940
something like email so if you send an

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,620
email if you have a link in your

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,370
signature Google Analytics doesn't know

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,290
where that comes from

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,120
same thing is if you send out marketing

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,620
campaigns and you have links go hey go

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,240
buy my product now or subscribe to this

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,190
or or you're trying to get them to read

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,510
an article by default if that's gonna go

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,070
underneath a channel which is not

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,350
picture right there in the middle called

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,540
direct so right now if you were to type

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,529
in your website name you go Frank Gore

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,449
SOCOM for course

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,290
you hit enter and then Google Analytics

00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,850
goes hey I don't know what this person

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,499
came from they must be they must have

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,149
typed it in directly which would make

00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,350
sense in my case but when they can't

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,269
figure out where I came from so if I

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,199
clicked on link in an email and I get

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,370
there they don't know where I came from

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,970
they're gonna oh they must have typed it

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,800
in directly

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,870
so all that everyone that clicks on

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,589
links in email or anywhere else will by

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,569
default go into direct so something

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,680
you'll want to if you do anything like

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,300
that you want to look into something

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,129
called UTM codes which we're going to

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,540
briefly go over towards the end but

00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,459
that'll be the way you can get things

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,980
underneath email or even an other

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,459
depending on what you're trying to do

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,199
and then next is behavior so this is

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,240
where a lot of the events and things

00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,009
that are taking place on your website so

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,720
if you have a wordpress site you might

00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:41,790
have a little search box somewhere on

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,110
your website maybe on the navigation or

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,290
maybe on the sidebar where someone can

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,610
search for something if you turn on in

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,230
google enix you can go to Site Search

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,920
and see what everyone is searching for

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,689
in your website

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
so you can go there and we oh everyone

00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,180
searching for this and I don't have it

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
on my website I should probably create

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,649
that content if you're doing event

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,389
tracking and go to events and you can

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,860
see what people are doing a website see

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,689
what videos people are watching seeing

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,610
what downloads they're downloading what

00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,689
PDFs they're viewing whatever the case

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:21,179
may be you would do that underneath

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:22,679
events yes so this right over on the

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,380
left here there's this little site

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,730
search if you click on that you'll get a

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,909
table of everything people are searching

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,130
for on your website on yours on your

00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:34,950
website so if yeah whatever website you

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,390
have as the property then the whatever

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,010
they search for will show up there as

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,360
long as you turn on and the options

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,010
which I'll try to show you towards the

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,299
end but there's just an option when

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,149
you're creating your property just to

00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,590
turn on Site Search blogging or a Site

00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:48,059
Search tracking and then you would just

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,539
go to this site search an old show up

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,539
right there for you

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,960
yeah so a use case maybe maybe you have

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,120
a website with articles on it and maybe

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,039
your big thing is content marketing so

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,019
you can go maybe you were talking about

00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,860
I have a client right now who does the

00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,539
Kido

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,370
I don't ket oh you might be familiar

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,690
with that the Kido yeah so it's a very

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,039
popular thing and there's people that

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,269
come to the website and they're their

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,070
search or they're reading articles

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,720
they're really enthusiastic about it but

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,249
then they were searching for this

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,929
particular method of Kido or some

00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,399
certain recipe and they kept searching

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,840
they wouldn't find it we looked in there

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,460
and realized I was massively searched

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,600
for it so we created that content

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,369
so that way the next person I searched

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,899
for it would see it so that was that use

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,759
case but there's lots of use cases that

00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:38,299
while we're knowing what people are

00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:43,559
searching for would probably be handy

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:44,730
you're welcome okay I don't have a

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,929
screen shot for convergence but

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,789
essentially convergence would be as

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,299
similar to report to this where it would

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:53,100
show what action what goals people have

00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,600
completed so if your goal is people buy

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,830
something on your website you would set

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,480
up like e-commerce and then you would

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,470
see how many people have bought

00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,980
something on your website and where do

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,869
they come from

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,399
and then you would also see if your goal

00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:04,619
is to get someone to subscribe to your

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:06,899
mailing list you could go to conversion

00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,009
and you would see some chart of going

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:09,570
hey this is the number of people that

00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:10,320
signed up for your mailing list and this

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,519
is where they came from

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,139
so it's audience acquisition behavior

00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,940
and conversions are the main areas so

00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:28,139
you'd be looking at does that sort of

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:29,669
make sense to you yes yes I'm gonna

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,980
mention that very towards the end

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,659
unfortunately I don't have a slide for

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,190
that one but I do have some information

00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:38,879
on how to find that towards the end of

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,200
the talk so any questions on where what

00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,399
section you might go to depending on

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,080
what you're looking for sure anything

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,240
they do on your website usually goes

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,580
underneath behavior so here we can see

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,610
what pages are most viewed which is

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,559
right here and if you go into the site

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,690
content there's a report there called

00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,220
top pages and you can see the most page

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,080
the pages that got viewed the most if

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,480
you have a vent set up you can go to

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,190
events and see what actions are taking

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,320
on your website if you have search you

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,269
can go to the sir

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,620
and see what people are searching for so

00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,880
it's pretty much what are they doing on

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,559
your website what pages are they viewing

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,120
what links they might be clicking what

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:28,639
are they downloading anything along

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:30,769
those lines yes going yes and no events

00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:31,730
can be whatever you define which we're

00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,139
only going to touch on that a little bit

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,630
in the sock towards the end but

00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:37,130
essentially if you anything that just

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,690
goes to another page you don't need to

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,279
because then you'll that's gonna just be

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,620
another page view but if you click on

00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,899
something and it does something or like

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,980
you click on it to open up a pop-up for

00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,879
them to sign up to a mailing list you

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,620
probably wanna know how many people

00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,000
click on that button so that you would

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,919
probably do it as an event so it'd be

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,230
some action they take that doesn't

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:59,230
necessarily go to different page yes

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,549
short so in google olynyk's

00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,590
when you set up your view and google

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,750
analytics you can turn on site search

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,070
tracking and then anytime anyone

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,080
searches for something on your WordPress

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,820
site you can go to the Site Search

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:23,740
report and I'll list out everything

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:26,350
people have searched for no no that's on

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,880
your site so if there's a search box on

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,860
your site they type in something it'll

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:36,669
show up right there that's not in Google

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:38,169
search it's no so this is if someone's

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:40,600
searching on your WordPress site and

00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:41,980
it's using the search functionality in

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,419
WordPress it's not anything to do with

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,110
Google search that would be the search

00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:48,639
functionality on your WordPress site and

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,679
that works by default just because

00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:52,840
WordPress is set up to work by default

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,980
if you've gone in and make changes using

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,389
like some of the search plugins that

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,010
might not work right away there might be

00:21:55,389 --> 00:22:02,279
some extra things but by default that'll

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,279
work just you just have to turn on yes

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:13,919
yes yes

00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,889
yes I'm gonna go over that right after

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,059
we get to the setting up but there's

00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:38,039
there's things you can do to make that

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,539
much easier so we'll go over that and if

00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,330
I don't we'll start go back towards the

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:44,879
end so just in case for those who

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,080
haven't set it up yet whenever you

00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,399
create your account for the first time

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,809
you'll see something like this if you

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,249
already have Google Analytics set up you

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,929
would go to the admin way down here in

00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,850
the bottom so there's an admin and

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,289
you'll see something like this when

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,610
you're on this screen you can create new

00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,139
accounts by cleaning the create account

00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,669
button and create new properties by

00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,289
clicking the create property button or

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,929
you can click create view and to create

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:06,330
new views once you have something set up

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,549
you can click this tracking info to get

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,779
to a tracking code section can we just

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,970
moment to finish my train of thought and

00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,019
then from there you'll use that and a

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:17,789
few places which I'll go over in just a

00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:20,159
moment yes what's your question this can

00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,409
be anything Shopify Squarespace Magento

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,179
Drupal something you coded by hand

00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,950
something you did in was that

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:30,389
Dreamweaver you know whatever whatever

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:33,450
you feel like using wait any questions

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:36,590
on me all right let me is it about this

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,590
or can I finish this training okay good

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,090
so if you're doing client work you're

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,290
going to do this a little bit

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,060
differently than this if this is your

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,430
own for me personally what I like to do

00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,420
is I have an account from my sites and

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,010
then I have different accounts for each

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,080
of the clients and that way if anything

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,220
happens that I need to transfer all that

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,330
ownership to someone else I can just

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,770
transfer that account I don't have to go

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,210
through which property is mine which

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,730
properties theirs which and it just

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,830
makes things easier but you could do it

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,210
either way and then but inside there you

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,980
would set up a property for each of the

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,770
client sites and then inside there you'd

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,060
have a view for each of their properties

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,040
and we're going to go on views in just a

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:28,090
moment but so essentially just depending

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:31,740
on there are I want to say it's like 50

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,760
though like it's a pretty high number so

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,440
depending on what you're trying to do

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,810
that you probably won't hit that right

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,570
away you have 67 clients then you might

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,190
want to do things differently but I do

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,540
you have for these 60 clients okay

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,500
so then in that case for now it's

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,950
sticking to that method is probably

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,950
easiest

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,219
[Music]

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,299
so how this works is these can be

00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,639
attached to multiple Google Analytics

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,379
Google accounts so if you're doing this

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,940
for the best interest of the client when

00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:15,330
you create this account you can set them

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,100
up as also admin users so you both have

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,389
admin users and they if you transfer

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,559
ownership to them right away then

00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:20,879
essentially they're the primary owner

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,019
and you're a secondary owner and they

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:23,850
can boot you off whenever they need to

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,549
so that would be the best way to do it

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,720
to handle that case depending it depends

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:30,269
on what kind of relationship you have

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,369
your clients in hook what notes so

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,259
essentially so this the Google Analytics

00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:35,730
account is different than a Google

00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,049
account so this kind of lives out here

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,669
and you have multiple Google Analytics

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,919
accounts attached or Google accounts

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:43,559
attached to it so you can have three

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,019
different Google accounts as admins for

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,859
a Google Analytics account is that sort

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,879
of answer the claim I know it's a little

00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,659
confusing cuz they both are called

00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:58,019
accounts but okay one more question then

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:59,700
we have to move on we're not gonna quite

00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,609
touch on that but so Google search

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,919
console is a separate thing but

00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:07,109
underneath it's a several slides back

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,119
but underneath behavior no acquisition

00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,559
you can actually link them together so

00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,009
some of the reports from search console

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,879
will show up in this in the reports but

00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:16,830
unfortunately it's a whole different

00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:20,970
tool so we're not gonna touch on that

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,889
too much in this talk okay so setting up

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,179
Google Analytics there's a few ways you

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,419
can do it if you're using a wordpress

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,369
site

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,409
so just remember before I touch on these

00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:30,299
right here in the middle there's the

00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:32,489
property and there's the tracking info a

00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,200
lot of these tools will need something

00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:37,440
underneath there so underneath there

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,419
there'll be either a code or as in like

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,769
an idea will be you a - an eight nine

00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,480
seven six something along those lines

00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,440
where will be some actual little bit of

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,029
code that you might have a copy and

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,340
paste but either way you'd be going

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:50,759
underneath the tracking info and then in

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,739
there I'm going the wrong way sorry so

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,179
depending on what you're doing a lot of

00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:56,700
themes will have a Google Analytics

00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,230
option inside so you just copy whatever

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,059
they ask you to copy and then paste it

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,080
from so from that tracking info you copy

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,149
what you need and then paste in your

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,460
theme settings and then you'd be done if

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:06,960
your theme does not have a setting there

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,390
might be there's several WordPress

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,520
WordPress plugin

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,380
you can use so monster insights is very

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,510
popular Google Analytics dashboard for

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,160
WP is also very popular and those work

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,390
very similarly and that you just copy a

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,670
little bit from the tracking info page

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,530
paste it in save it and you'll be done

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,470
and they'll handle everything else for

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,790
you now if you're outside of WordPress

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,290
maybe you have a client site or you have

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,520
an extra site save a WordPress site for

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,480
your marketing site and then you have a

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Squarespace for actually selling

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,110
products or Shopify all those other

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,820
services usually have a Google Analytics

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,810
option and their advanced settings so

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,610
you can just copy and paste your code

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,740
into and you'll be done as well so it's

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:44,240
fairly easily hopefully to get it up and

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:46,010
running so once you get it you copy your

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,530
tracking info and paste it in you're

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,080
gonna start getting data in by default

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,780
you'll have this all website data view

00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,490
so this is the admin page still and

00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,990
we're focused on the view column over

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,090
here there's something called the all

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,170
website data view so anyone that goes to

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,300
your website and any action that gets

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,270
taken all goes in this all website data

00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:08,390
view always keep that view and never

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:10,790
touch it because if you accidentally

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,170
break it and then you log in three weeks

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,760
from now realize you weren't tracking

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,610
any data for three weeks you're not

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,960
getting that data back so always keep

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,100
that like I can't stress this enough

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,360
this probably the most important thing

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,390
I'll say during this presentation

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,670
keep that view and don't touch it and

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,320
what you want to do instead is click

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,180
this line up here that says create view

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,980
and then you can name this whatever you

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,160
want I usually call it without me or

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,510
just without spam or master view or just

00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,820
something that goes okay this is the

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,130
view I can touch and not the other one

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,140
and then that way this other view is

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,910
whatever you want to do you can play

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,380
with that but if you accidentally break

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:49,030
it you can still fall back on the all

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,680
website data in case you need that data

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,030
so what I recommend doing is clicking

00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,980
create view and then creating something

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,320
so either master view or without me or

00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,030
without spam and when you do it when you

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,470
click so in here in the view settings

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,230
towards the bottom there's a little

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,960
checkbox that says exclude spam and BOTS

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,040
and stuff you'll want to check that and

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,560
that way in your master view you won't

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,820
have all this spam data in it now

00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,900
there's a lot of other things you can do

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,830
the views and fortune is a little bit

00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,560
more advanced so we're not going to get

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,940
into that too far but does that kind of

00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,410
make sense of why you need that second

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,530
view does anyone is anyone confused by

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,530
that

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,630
yeah sort of just think of it as like

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:35,370
the foundation of all your data exactly

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,080
so whenever you create a view it only

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,700
has the data it collects going forward

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,960
so the all website data as soon as you

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,540
put in your tracking code it starts

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,250
clicking collecting data but then the

00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,450
view if you wait six months to create

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,370
this master view the master view will

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,990
only have data from that point going

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,910
forward so you still want to refer back

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,100
to the all website data for that older

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:57,510
data so it's it's like the foundation I

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,310
would probably say so within views what

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,480
makes views really amazing is you even

00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,980
have different views set up for

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,140
different purposes and you could use

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,110
something called a filter to filter some

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,240
of the data out so for example so

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,100
underneath the views we have view

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,420
settings user management goals content

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,180
and then there's this option here called

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:18,240
filters inside there you can set up

00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,510
during filters go hey don't add me into

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,540
the data or don't add this known spambot

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,940
into the data or don't add anyone from

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,340
desktop maybe I only want to see mobile

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,020
users in this view you would use those

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,000
filters to create that kind of

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:37,680
differences and the data so let me see

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,090
on this left screenshot would be if you

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,210
had filters you could have this table

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,230
here so in this example I have I'm

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,460
excluding some language spam that's

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,170
common in the Google Analytics I'm

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,940
filtering out my own laptop and my own

00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,260
desktop I have a spam filter I set up

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,820
and then I set up something called

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,950
forced lower case we're going to go over

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,780
UTM code sores en but you can actually

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,220
modify some of the data as it comes in

00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:00,840
using filters so might the first one

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,280
that I usually recommend is if you click

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,230
add filter you get a little screen like

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,000
this we can click predefined or custom

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,190
you click predefined and click IP

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,810
address you can enter your IP address of

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,370
your desktop and it will exclude you

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,660
from that view so when you go there you

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,220
won't see you showing up in the data

00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,200
influencing your numbers so that's

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,700
usually the first one I recommend if you

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,500
have a desktop if you have a laptop you

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,330
move around a lot that it won't be so

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,410
super helpful but if you have a desktop

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,440
that's usually the first thing you

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,390
should be doing so that's a that's

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,830
filters in a nutshell I know we're we're

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,090
already almost the question/answer time

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,890
so I don't have time to explore that too

00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,760
much what is filters and views kind of

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,200
makes sense

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,550
okay do you at least understand the

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,840
concepts if you know hey I need to do

00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,640
this this is what I we need to research

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,580
you know it and well enough to do okay

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,710
awesome okay dashboards this is if you

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,870
do client work this is you need to like

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,100
really pay ten if you ignore me the rest

00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,830
of the talk this is the time to listen

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,120
so dashboards are this really if you go

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,170
have you've ever played Google Analytics

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,700
you could probably spend three weeks

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,260
looking at the data and still have no

00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,400
idea what you just looked at and it's

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,070
very overwhelming

00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,690
so dashboards are a way that you can go

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,820
hey I just need to see these three

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,170
numbers I just need to know maybe I have

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,970
a goal in mind I want to get increased

00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,430
my social media traffic so I get more

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,020
sales so you create this dashboard and

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,550
then you can go okay I want this little

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,210
box tell me how many unique visitors I

00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,560
had last week

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,570
this little box tell me how many total

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,100
visits and maybe this box tell me the

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,330
keywords people are searching for and

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,950
you just want this box it tell me how to

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,120
Googlebot stuff maybe that's all you

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,220
need to know so you can create a

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,110
dashboard create little boxes and go hey

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,720
this is the report I only need to look

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,040
at this and that way it removes all that

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
extra noise and you can create this

00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,520
little guy that just goes hey this is a

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,440
little tiny box that's all I need to pay

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,670
attention to now that may seem

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,170
overwhelming going I don't know what

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,940
numbers I need because you might not

00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,860
know that right away well the beautiful

00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,180
thing is is when you go into this when

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,890
you create your first one there's this

00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,030
little starter dashboard you click on

00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,490
that it will pre-populate all those

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,800
boxes for you even better you can click

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,510
import from gallery and then there's all

00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,400
these user templates that users have

00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,960
created for different purposes so you go

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,910
I wouldn't increase my content marketing

00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,590
growth so you can click import from

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,210
gallery type in content marking and

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,920
you'll find a dashboard suited for that

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,480
goal if you want to type in social media

00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,730
you'll find a dashboard that's already

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,380
pre-created designed to help you focus

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,090
on social media numbers so whatever your

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,830
goal is you can click import from

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,690
gallery type that and at least get

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,710
started and then once you understand

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,460
dashboards a little bit more and you see

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,170
how they're all work then maybe you

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,970
start making tweaks to it but to get

00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,290
started I would recommend importing from

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,960
gallery and just typing whatever you're

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,100
focused on at the time now and then in

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,170
the last slide there's this last point

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,090
right here if you do client work this is

00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,530
amazing so essentially with the

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,690
dashboards at the top here this is a

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,520
little email button you can click email

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,870
and you type an email address and I'll

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,920
send out that's that sounds great in

00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,420
itself but then there's this little

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,220
option Earnie that goes I went on a

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,080
regular basis so you check this and go

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,180
oh every Monday send this report out and

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,010
then you so whatever you do is every

00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,750
Monday you get this dashboard emailed to

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,110
you and then you glance it over and then

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,429
type of

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,080
two sentences for analysis and sent off

00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,460
to your client and they're like wow you

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,700
must have spending weeks on these this

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,280
is amazing and I'm telling you it works

00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,530
so it's but even if it's just for

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,270
yourself just having an email to you

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,440
every single Monday and going okay all I

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,790
have to do is just look at this

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,610
dashboard and I know everything I need

00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,320
to know that if you came into this going

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,490
oh Google X is overwhelming knowing you

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,929
can do that it's probably a sigh of

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,440
relief because that is an amazing

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,639
experience all right we only have a few

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,710
minutes left so I'm going to touch on

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,649
you TMS real quick so getting better

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:23,679
data with you TMS you TMS if you haven't

00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:25,389
encountered these before and remember

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,240
these slides will be available after so

00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,280
you don't have to so you TMP's so way

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,570
back way back when decades ago there was

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,220
this platform called Archon web

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,560
analytics and they used this cool thing

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,270
called an urchin tracking module well

00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,040
then her tchen web analytics was bought

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,200
by google and changed his name to Google

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,000
Analytics and then became like the de

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,619
facto standard so now every other

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,879
analytics platform in the world all uses

00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,639
the same thing because it's so popular

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,409
so you can use this pretty much on any

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,990
announced back foot and an analytics

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,429
platform and if you create these to use

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,109
it Google at Google Analytics and you

00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,490
move to another NX but analytics

00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:59,890
platform it'll automatically work

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,690
because it's the standard so this is the

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,220
way that you can get specific data

00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,010
instead of everything falling into that

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:08,260
direct channel that I mentioned earlier

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,270
you can use this to go hey this link I

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,890
want to say I want to know exactly what

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,020
this does and this is the way I want

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,760
Google Analytics report it so for

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,010
example you could track how many people

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,660
click your email signature you could

00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,920
track you can test which links in your

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,660
email marketing converts the most

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,130
customers so maybe you sent out an email

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,630
with a new product and you have a link

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,970
at the top and a link at the bottom or

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,410
you have this three email sequence that

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,480
are kind of setting up this new product

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,100
you can see which link out of all those

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,330
people actually clicked on and which of

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,160
those links people clicked on that

00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,780
actually went on to buy something or do

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,500
whatever you needed them to do you would

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:44,200
use UTM s to do this so there's five

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,420
parts of a UTM campaign is the actual

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,030
name that you want to give this campaign

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,210
so it might be spring sale spring sale

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,619
2019 or my new product or whatever you

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,109
want to name it you can this is entirely

00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,430
up to you but it would be whatever name

00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:59,980
you want to see when you go into goo

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,800
analytics and you go to acquisition you

00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,230
there's a little bit

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,060
new campaign report and then so they'll

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,190
be all fun or underneath the campaign

00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,080
name so if you have all these there if

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:14,000
you have a spring sale 2019 and then

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:15,470
maybe book launch or new I don't know

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,700
whatever but any of those other

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,370
campaigns whatever you wanted to see

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,220
there so you know what this is you would

00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,590
want to name it as the campaign here the

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,700
medium is the type of platform so that

00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,900
in this case it would be something like

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,850
email or social or CPC if you're doing

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,620
cost per click ads something along those

00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,420
lines what is the medium that is being

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,090
used with this link and then source

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,800
would be the actual platform so if you

00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,510
have something where a medium is social

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,710
then source might be Twitter or Facebook

00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:47,510
if you have medium as CPC at cost per

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,180
click ad then the source might be Google

00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,650
ads or Bing ads if you have a medium of

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,780
email the source might be the exact

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,640
email so maybe it's book launch email

00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,850
number one or something to that effect

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,560
now content is this optional one that

00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,080
you can use to differentiate between

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,780
links that have the same campaign medium

00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,520
and source so maybe you have a campaign

00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,870
called book launch and then you have a

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,670
medium of email and you have a source of

00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,290
book launch email one we have two links

00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,120
in there so they'll both have these same

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,250
thing so you can use content as link 1

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,660
and Link 2 so you can see the data

00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,970
that's different between those two links

00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,590
or maybe you have two different Facebook

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,270
posts linked to the same thing so you

00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,820
can have some campaign like book launch

00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,650
medium of social source of Facebook but

00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,060
then post one and post two so you can

00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,740
compare how those posts did and the

00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,900
actual over and your actual conversion

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,130
rates now the term we're not going to

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,050
dive into that but that's use more for

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,150
paid keywords and ads if you use CPC

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,740
cost per click ads Google Ads you want

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,260
to look more into that to track the

00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,520
keywords that are being ranked for it so

00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,900
here's a quick example I know we're

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,330
almost out of time so maybe you want to

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,010
once you fast I went to send out an

00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,810
email newsletter with new posts with

00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,850
multiple links so I had this URL I

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,800
posted this article a while ago now so

00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,720
that was the URL and then I have a

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,940
campaign that I named it the same exact

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,680
name as the post because that was just

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,760
my big push at the time so campaign what

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,530
should you write about my medium was

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,970
email the source was the new post

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,770
broadcast that's what I named the email

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,060
and then I had a Content side two

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,500
different links I had a main link then I

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,540
had a secondary link towards the bottom

00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,220
and so that created a ul that looked

00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,010
like this so when someone clicked on

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,960
that that's

00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,700
URL that would go to and GU analytics

00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,320
would see all these pram extra-- things

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,800
and the URL and go okay I need to

00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,240
collect that data too now if you look at

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,010
that and go wow that's a lot to type out

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,440
and I'm gonna make a spelling error I

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,810
can guarantee it don't worry there's a

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,280
UTM builder for that so if you search I

00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,810
don't have any listed here mainly

00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,670
because there's thousands of them but if

00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,350
you google search Google URL builder

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,120
it's like the very first one is made by

00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,380
Google and then the second one is made

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,660
by Facebook and the third ones made by

00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,920
Bing so it's you can pretty much trust

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,690
that those are going to work exactly the

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,830
way you need them to but all of them

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,760
work slightly differently they have

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,500
these different colors so I don't

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,030
usually recommend one so I just play

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,950
with the one I use is the Google URL

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,750
builder but you can just if you just

00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,550
search UTM builder or URL builder you

00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:08,520
will find pages of them so just find one

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:10,590
you like yes yes and you could

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,270
theoretically to not to go to advanced

00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:14,190
and crazy but you could have this

00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,870
override some of the defaults so maybe

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,880
you want to group a variety of different

00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,500
social social referrals and stuff

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,990
together underneath the campaign maybe a

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,760
big spring launch sale and you want to

00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,720
go hey don't put this in social don't

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,550
put this in direct don't put this way

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:37,650
over here you can override it using UTM

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:38,880
as well so campaign so UTM is go

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,470
underneath acquisition this is how

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,850
people get to your website events is

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,950
what happens on your website so that's

00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:47,060
behavior so these would you actually use

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,060
these together in most cases

00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:01,950
okay well so all you're doing it so if

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,030
it's not your site then that's okay

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,320
because then you're just going hey I

00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,910
don't care if I'm spot knows where it

00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,710
came from but if it's your own site you

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,060
probably want to be a little bit more

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:21,450
careful of exactly what's in there

00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:24,750
depending on what your objectives are so

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:26,580
know they said they don't auto-generate

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,870
so by default if you don't have UTM

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,000
there then oh do the default Google

00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,950
Analytics so someone clicks on it it'll

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,390
just go underneath social and Google and

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,950
knows that it's from Facebook but then

00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,140
it won't know a campaign to put it under

00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,360
that's the only difference so this is

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,070
only to help you better categorize your

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,840
data and get a little bit more from it

00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:46,190
but it's not needed by default Google

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,190
Analytics will do a lot of this itself

00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:57,330
that's where you definitely want to use

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:58,980
it because yes/no now some mail email

00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,230
lists providers I think mil Trump also

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,210
has it there's a little UTM ad UTM tags

00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:06,270
option when you paste your link in so

00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,680
you can just like type in these couple

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,600
of things and then I'll create the URL

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,920
for you right there as you put it in but

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,090
not all of them do that I don't know if

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:18,720
MailChimp does I want to say it does but

00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:20,940
that'd be something - exactly but it

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,320
also so for example if we go back to

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,090
this example here maybe I sent out this

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,950
email newsletter and maybe the goal of

00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,510
that new post was again to buy a product

00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,310
well MailChimp wouldn't have that data

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:31,440
so by having it over here I can go hey I

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,970
sent out this article and I saw three

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,830
people who came from that article bought

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,240
this product and I want to go to do that

00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,670
with MailChimp data alone I'd have to

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,870
have that in Google Analytics all right

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,250
and we're just out of time let me just

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,660
wrap this up and I'll try to fit some

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,250
questions in so where do you go from

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,960
here there's a couple things we did not

00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,910
go over it goals and e-commerce and I

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,050
mentioned these in passing these are

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,490
definitely great tools they're a little

00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,300
bit more advanced so I wouldn't start

00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,100
with these if you're just getting

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,230
started but what you would look for is

00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,030
goals ecommerce you can track what is

00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,500
being bought in your site what category

00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,060
of product what product itself things

00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,260
along those lines event tracking just

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,170
pretty much will you talk about it with

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,190
events custom dimensions it's actually a

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,420
little bit more events I'm going to go

00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,770
back to that during question/answer

00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,220
learn more about filters and views

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,540
there's so

00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,369
much more you can do that then even the

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,320
example as I mentioned there's also two

00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:15,270
other tools that Google makes that

00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,500
layers on top of these so once you know

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,750
all this stuff you can go to Google tag

00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,160
manager and even include so much more

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,140
different actions into it and then you

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,849
have Google Data studio which imports

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,770
all of your other data from your mailing

00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,480
lists in your Facebook pages and creates

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,250
even more reports so you can create I

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,109
wouldn't recommend starting there like

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,700
start with Google Analytics but as you

00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:34,760
go that's where this is the kind of game

00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,200
plan that you would want to aim for and

00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,330
last but not least I have these slides

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,859
at Frank's slides calm that just

00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,060
redirects to SlideShare all my slides

00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,849
are there so if you wanna browse and

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,080
then I also have almost all of these

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:47,670
everything I talked about I have as

00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,170
articles on the front core so that me

00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,550
website so if you're interested in

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,050
reading more about any of these you can

00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,240
find it there and of course I am

00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,440
available so if you want to hire me to

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,710
do some gue analytic stuff I'm always

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,090
here alright we do have I think a couple

00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,070
of minutes I don't know couple minutes

00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,070
