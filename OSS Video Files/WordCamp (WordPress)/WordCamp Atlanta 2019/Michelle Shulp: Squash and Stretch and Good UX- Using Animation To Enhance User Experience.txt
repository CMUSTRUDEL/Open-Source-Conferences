Title: Michelle Shulp: Squash and Stretch and Good UX- Using Animation To Enhance User Experience
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Modern browsers, JavaScript libraries, and CSS3 have made it easier than ever to create exciting, dynamic animated experiences within web interfaces. But we have also seen the unfortunate side effect of trying to do too much: websites that are resource hogs, eating up bandwidth and slowing load times to a crawl, all for effects that are ultimately just there for the “show” factor. This talk will discuss how to use these animation skills for good: to establish context, convey status, give feedback, and yes, even add a little delight. Along the way, we’ll discuss the principles of animation that guide everything from your favorite feature films to the actions of a button on your screen, and learn how deliberate animation choices can improve the experience for your user.

yeah good job it's good it was all great

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
hi everybody

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,389
there's everybody enjoying WordCamp yes

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,610
all right that sounds like a Sunday

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,620
morning I went to the after party last

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,410
night enjoying word camp yeah how many

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,020
people is it your first word camp ever

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,150
oh my gosh I love how it's always like a

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,100
billion people like we keep having them

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,480
all over the place and every time

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,880
there's always so many new people that's

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,500
so exciting this is not my first word

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,840
camp but it is my first word camp

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,279
Atlanta so I'm so thrilled to be here

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,540
it's been really really fun thanks for

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,899
the welcome a little more about me hi so

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,480
I'm Michele like you saw and I design

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,730
and build digital interfaces so my

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,260
background was in design visual

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,739
communications is what I studied in

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,329
school currently I do front-end

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,780
development and I also do a lot of

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,149
strategy focused UX design but my first

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,890
freelance job ever right when I was

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,199
still in college was actually doing

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,969
banner and header animations and flash

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,369
for a career builder like for summer

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,790
there so yeah back end right that was a

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,220
thing so I've been doing animation since

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,290
well it was you know flash was never it

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,450
was cool but it was never cool and I was

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,150
doing that for a while but obviously

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,520
nowadays we don't have flash anymore

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,610
right but we still have plenty of

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,650
animation right we have even more great

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,960
technologies that enable us to interact

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,360
with all sorts of stuff on websites

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,820
we've got JavaScript obviously and

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,040
modern CSS even allows us to do a whole

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,110
bunch of animation so we can do a lot of

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,630
things that let us interact dynamically

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,880
with our websites so in the modern age

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,170
and the enlightened age the the post

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,560
flash age right what does that look like

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,710
um so unfortunately although we have

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
left flash and myspace behind

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,549
animation still causes problems on the

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,409
web you've probably noticed if you go to

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,570
a website some of the stuff you see is

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,070
very it's very resource-intensive right

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,290
like there's just the struggle is real

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,630
when it comes to loading and there's

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,160
usually bandwidth issues a lot of

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,020
animation on the web right now you'll

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,390
probably agree is like very overdone

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,830
it's unnecessary it's annoying it's

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,220
complex

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,260
and if you there's too much motion going

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,240
on if there's too much it leads to

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,580
purposeful ignorance right it's like the

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,290
the add blindness effect so you just

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,670
think that it's a banner ad like the

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,770
ones I used to build for career builder

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,020
and just ignore it right so there's a

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,840
lot of kind of problems with animation

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,450
on the web right now and one of the

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
biggest ones is the the parallax website

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,380
trend how many of you have seen a

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,270
parallax website right how many of you

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,590
have built a parallax website you don't

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,700
have to admit to it it's okay if you

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,170
don't want to yeah so there's a group

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,970
called the Nielson group which I'm

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,860
basically just going to quote them all

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,290
the time and if you take anything away

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,780
from this talk it's just do whatever the

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,070
Nielson group says cool but they're

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,230
basically one of the foremost

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,840
authorities on user experience and they

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,970
did a study on parallax websites and

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
what they found is that users find them

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,140
very very difficult to control

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,790
obviously they take longer to load which

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,610
is a problem especially if you don't

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,650
have a really great internet connection

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,180
users find them disorienting it they

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,000
find them dizzying they find them

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,970
distracting and honestly they're they

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,560
don't even find them that cool it's so

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,320
it sounds like it's really just like not

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,390
that worth it to do one of these complex

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,400
parallax websites like it's not that

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,330
cool for all of the problems that it

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,940
causes there's also a concept in

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,890
animation called jank this is from like

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,450
the regular animation industry and it's

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,600
basically in an animation you've

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,670
probably seen this where there is

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,890
stuttering there one of those is mine

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,500
yeah that's that's yeah there we go got

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,300
it there's there stuttering there's

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,560
halting it's breaking the flow so it's

00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,330
basically when you notice that

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,440
something's wrong with the animation

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,320
right so this is called jank I just

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,690
really like this word and this happens a

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,760
lot on the web when the animation can't

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,440
keep up with you know bandwidth or it

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,240
loads improperly right so there's a lot

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,120
of problems that are with animation

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,489
nowadays but I am NOT saying that

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,010
animation is the enemy it can still be

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,450
an extremely useful tool and the point

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,859
of my presentation is to answer this

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,560
question how can we avoid these problems

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,690
and use animation effectively right so

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
let's let's avoid jank let's avoid over

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,830
complex sites how many of you

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,260
we have heard of the 12 principles of

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,610
animation we're like kind of close to

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,580
Florida so I figured maybe some of your

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,920
Disney fans right but these were were 12

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,900
principles that were developed by the

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,640
original Disney animators at Disney

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,560
Animation Studios and they're also

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,790
published as a really great book that

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,220
looks super impressive on your coffee

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,570
table I've got one obviously because you

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,730
know I want people to think I'm smart

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,530
but what's really cool about these is

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,030
they were created in the very early days

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,250
of animation when they were trying to

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,500
define what is animation as a

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,230
storytelling medium to provide a

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,030
platform to make animations feel more

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,500
physically and more psychologically

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,030
believable so basically we're going to

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,070
be talking about how to convey physics

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,530
and psychology in 2d that is the point

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,080
of the 12 principles of animation so

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,090
number one is a squash and stretch so

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,140
how many of you have heard of squash and

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,150
stretch this is usually one that people

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,470
have seen before

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,690
squash and stretch if you've ever seen a

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,980
bouncing ball in slow motion this is a

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,570
real thing that happens you know the

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,130
ball it goes down and when it hits the

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,020
ground it kind of compresses and then it

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,060
springs back up that's exactly what's

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,730
happening here in this animation and

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,090
what squash and stretch does is it's

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,950
used to convey the physics of mass right

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,870
because materials have mass and the

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,730
materials have flexibility they're

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,320
impacted by gravity they might behave

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,660
differently depending on what a material

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,550
is so using squash and stretch

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,920
effectively gives you some sense of the

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,800
physics of mass of that material that

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,890
you are animating there's also a

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,660
principle called anticipation where it

00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,550
needs energy to start and stop and this

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,950
is also physics this is a concept called

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,390
inertia right which means that you know

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,160
an object in motion tends to stay in

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,590
motion an object at rest tends to stay

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,930
at rest unless acted upon by an outside

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,670
force so we're seeing like that energy

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,610
that's needed to like start a thing

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,890
moving it also can be used to add

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,990
sentience to a thing like a wind up

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,370
before a pitch or like getting ready to

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,230
run before you take off from a starting

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,420
line so anticipation is this thing this

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,000
sense of energy before something starts

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,030
moving it just makes it feel more

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,190
physically believable there's a concept

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,230
called staging now this isn't a physics

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,820
or concept it's basically just any kind

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,040
of art-direction concept but it's

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,900
guiding the viewer to the most important

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,889
part of the stage and it can be any

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,210
number of things you could be using move

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,729
you could be using a little burst like

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,830
this thing is but you can also use the

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,999
layout you can also use focus you can

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,740
use relationships between different

00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,599
things basically staging is anything

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,830
that helps guide the viewer to wherever

00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,990
you want them to look there's a couple

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,539
of concepts and animation straight ahead

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,240
action versus pose to pose now if any of

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,779
you ever worked in flash any of you ever

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,969
do any work in flash so you may have

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,219
experience with key framing right and so

00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,599
straight ahead action is where you

00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,949
literally draw each of the key frames

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,659
right and there's some stuff you can do

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,419
in CSS that's very similar to this and

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,639
pose to pose is basically what you could

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,139
do in flash by tweening

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,810
and we'll talk a little bit about that

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,789
later in regular animation it was

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,069
basically like laying out all of the key

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,020
frames and and and then it was like you

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,610
have to draw each one or it was drawing

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,740
the main poses and then just letting the

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,300
junior animator figure out what goes in

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,979
between all of those poses right so

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,409
those are some different animation

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,120
concepts

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:43,990
here's another physics concept it's

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,659
called follow through and overlapping

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,659
action and this also has to do with the

00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:52,360
physics of mass the physics of a thing

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:55,900
so different differences in mass for

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,129
example if I if I'm moving like

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,839
different parts of my body are probably

00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,129
going to stop at different times because

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,210
they weigh different things they're

00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,409
doing different things my hair is

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,240
probably gonna do something different

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,589
than the rest of my body if I stop I

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,839
mean I don't have long hair but if I did

00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,399
it would just go in my face when I stop

00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,849
running for example I don't know why I'd

00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,740
be running that sounds terrible but also

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,659
it has to do with like you know this

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,520
thing is a tall thing right and so when

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,020
it gets started the top of its gonna

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,430
tend to keep going right and then it's

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,770
going to slow down differently so again

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,750
it's behaving believably this is how an

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,909
object probably would actually behave if

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,569
it was a random sentient rectangle going

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:32,769
back and forth on a screen this is

00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,329
another concept that has to do with

00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,010
acceleration there's a lot of physics

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:38,260
happening here and this is called the

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,490
slow in and slow out we've also talked

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,870
about easing I'm going to talk about

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,899
easing a little bit later but that's

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,550
basically this concept things don't just

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,380
immediately be at speed and then

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,510
immediately stop right they usually have

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,339
to accelerate again that inertia concept

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,649
they usually have to decelerate to stop

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,190
it might be quick it might be slow but

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,790
there's not it's not instantaneous

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,650
so this is this concept of easing

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,420
there's also the concept of an arc so

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,370
again we're going back to physics I

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,890
luckily I liked physics a lot when I was

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,390
in school so this is good but objects in

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,920
aerial motion tend to follow an arc

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,320
assuming that there's no air resistance

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,150
or whatever and obviously we all know

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,830
from physics that we never account for

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,760
air resistance it's always spherical

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,400
objects in a vacuum

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,390
I think it's funny no one else laughs

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,830
it's okay physics joke but anyway

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,480
objects that move through the air tend

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,950
to move through an arc they don't move

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,490
in straight lines and so this is just

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:33,110
another concept of believability

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,870
secondary action is basically supporting

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,480
motion and this has to do with physics

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,550
and with psychology physics because of

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,410
the attention to detail again if I'm

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,790
running and I had long hair my hair

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,930
would probably behave differently it

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,070
would probably be behind me when I'm

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,590
running and then it would kind of fly up

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,940
into my face when I stop so that's kind

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,680
of that physics of the different parts

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,240
of your body

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,100
psychology though it adds to the element

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,630
of believability right because the more

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,800
secondary motion that's happening the

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,050
more it feels like this is a thing

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,850
that's real if any of you watched

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,560
monsters Inc it was a really big deal

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,190
when they animated all of the hairs on

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,470
Sulley

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,960
that's an ex an example of secondary

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,430
action because it's the small detail

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,840
that makes it more believable that yet

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,890
this is a hairy monster walking through

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,780
air right concept called timing so this

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,900
has to do a lot with several different

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,790
parts of physics these these are shaped

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,040
the same they're doing the same thing

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,930
but you kind of believe that they're

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,550
very very different materials or they're

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,800
very different weights or the little

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,130
boxes have very different strengths or

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,680
very different levels of acceleration so

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,330
timing is a way to convey kind of the

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,580
presence of an object and whether it's

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,870
supposed to be heavy or light or quick

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,910
or slow or whether there's a lot of

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,950
friction or it's really you know easy to

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,850
move these are all concepts that can be

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,350
talked about through timing and

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,080
exaggeration this is a psychological

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,900
thing so actually kind of like how if

00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,280
you're wearing stage makeup on stage it

00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,330
looks great but if you see them in real

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,000
life walking down the street you'd be

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:05,030
like oh my goodness right exaggeration

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,770
makes something seem more believable if

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,510
you overemphasize it so when you're

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,910
doing animation obviously this is you

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,280
know

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,660
obviously squared teeth chomping but

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,210
that's very very exaggerated if it was

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,410
more subtle maybe it wouldn't seem as as

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,700
right like it would just seem a little

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,840
bit off concept of solid drawing

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,610
basically means that we believe the

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,580
object can physically exist because it's

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,140
following consistent principles of

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,940
existing in space right like it's not

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,320
going through itself or contorting

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,710
itself in some weird space-time

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,150
continuum wibbly-wobbly way like it is

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,280
following the principles of solid

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,230
drawing it behaves consistently with

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,240
itself it behaves consistently with its

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,040
environment you know everything is

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,710
following the same vanishing points etc

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,900
that's solid drawing and then we have

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,550
this this concept called appeal and this

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,320
is very psychological this is basically

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,090
just like you know the heart and soul of

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,460
the thing like is it delightful is it

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,740
fun is it personable this is very very

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,630
subjective obviously but a lot of brands

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,760
try to add appeal to their brand right

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,840
like MailChimp is a great example of a

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,770
brand that just tries to add a little

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,510
bit of appeal a little bit of

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,670
personality but this is kind of the

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,500
final principle of animation and it's

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,480
just this little thing of like adding

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,750
adding a soul to your to your object

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
right so this was super fun and it made

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,500
a lot of sense I'm sure but like how how

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,970
useful is this to us like that was

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,620
really cool to watch a rectangle slide

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,580
through space but what does that have to

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,640
do with web animation right so what do

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,910
these principles provide to us what

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,310
these things give us is realism so they

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,290
let us establish how things would

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,390
actually behave in the real world they

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,030
give us context so they establish

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,830
spatial relationships between states

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,290
between different objects and between

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,690
all of these things and they're staged

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,640
they give us causality so we know that

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,370
one thing is influencing another thing

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,470
on action is influencing an object we

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,450
can see the reaction there they give us

00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,130
focus again we're directing attention to

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,600
the most important elements and they

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,980
give us delight right they give us some

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,630
positive experiences that give us

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,540
personality that's back to that appeal

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,940
concept all right so now I'm done with

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,010
all the philosophy parts I hope that was

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,350
super fun we're gonna go into practical

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,240
stuff which is what are the properties

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,970
we can animate and in what way can we

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,110
animate them so this is an animation

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,360
vocabulary lesson not that it wasn't

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,230
before but we're going into it now so

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,840
what are

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,180
elements that we can animate right one

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,590
is color you can animate the fill of an

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,030
object you can animate the border of an

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,690
object right you can change the color in

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,490
some way you can animate the location of

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,680
an object right where it is relative to

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,330
everything else you can animate the

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,430
scale is it going to get bigger is it

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,290
going to get smaller you can animate the

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,700
shape you know we talked about tweening

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,860
you can change the shape of something

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,230
into something else you can animate the

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,120
focus you can make it more more in focus

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,710
and more out of focus and you can

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,950
animate the opacity right you can make

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,240
it more opaque or more transparent so

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,900
these are all different things that you

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,310
can animate on the web well I said I'd

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,080
talk about using and this is like my

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,210
favorite animation on this whole thing

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,910
it's so hypnotic I just want to stare at

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,820
it but using is that that slow and slow

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,770
out thing that we talked about easing in

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,060
is basically accelerating so that means

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,150
you're starting slow and you're getting

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,550
faster that's called easing in easing

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,100
out I'm sure you can guess is slowing

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,870
down or decelerating right and then

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,070
there's also the concept of bounce and

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,380
we talked about the follow-through

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,300
earlier so bounce is when you use

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,850
follow-through to go slightly past its

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,580
destination it makes it seem like it's

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,890
later like if I'm if I'm going to like

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,660
run and suddenly stop like I'm not gonna

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,550
suddenly stop gracefully I'm gonna kind

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,870
of like fall forward a little bit that's

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,000
that bounce that's that follow-through

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,520
so if you have an object that's kind of

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,810
bouncing that means that it kind of

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,000
happened probably quicker and it's a

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,040
little bit more believable if it Springs

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,300
towards you so now we're gonna talk a

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,690
little bit about timing because that was

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,820
a thing again Jakob Nielsen right they

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,830
had a study called three important time

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
limits and these are the three important

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,030
time notes I'm going to give you some

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,610
examples pretty soon so any response

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,630
time if an animation responds in 100

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,820
milliseconds or less

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,320
it feels pretty much instantaneous like

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
that's how your brain works some people

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,550
it's a little bit different per person

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,530
but basically about a tenth of a second

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,460
feels instantaneous like it just

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:26,070
happened right away response time of up

00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,140
to one second still felt like it was

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,000
connected so I did a thing within a

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,920
second if something happens I feel like

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,530
the thing I did caused the other thing

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,060
to happen so that is like it's good for

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,870
navigation it's good for major stage

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,160
just right after 10 seconds people tend

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,170
to lose the train of thought they don't

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,050
remember what happened to cause

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,970
something to to animate so let's go

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,610
through some examples here so this is a

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,990
really good example of a basically an

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,490
instantaneous rate so it's usually like

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,110
some kind of toggle right like a radio

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,270
button to toggle a checkbox you

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,580
basically feel like I did it it happened

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,990
instantaneous done I mean there is some

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,260
animation here but it's really really

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,180
fast somewhere in between that that

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,880
tenth of a second in that 1 second are

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,740
maybe some slightly longer animations so

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,270
they look a little more detail we don't

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,860
want it to be so fast that people don't

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,990
see it we do want it to be noticeable

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,890
but it's still well within that flow of

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,110
thought right the the one-second flow of

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,610
thought this is great for state changes

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,320
so I'm using a lot of examples by the

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,150
way from material design because they

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,250
just have a lot of really good examples

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,810
and they've really well documented all

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,120
of their animation processes but

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,070
obviously material design is not the

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,450
only one out there doing animation it

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,430
was just very very convenient to use

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,720
them as examples but here's an example

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,790
of you click on a thing and there's a

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,960
page transition it's within that 1

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,520
second flow of thought because it's

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,350
really clear like I clicked on a thing

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,300
and therefore something happened but

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,590
because a lots going on you want it to

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,120
take a little bit longer so it feels

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,910
natural it doesn't want to just jump out

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,460
at you when we start getting up to that

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,420
10 seconds though when people are losing

00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,980
their train of thought

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,380
that's when you want to have some kind

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,090
of secondary animation in there to

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,350
indicate that something is going on

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,780
because if you just clicked on something

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,100
and there was a blank screen and it sat

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,290
there for 10 seconds and then suddenly

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,120
some stuff came up you'd be like did I

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,680
break it like did I did I lose my

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,870
internet connection what's happening

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,430
right now so that's why progress

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,320
indicators loading States all of that

00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,790
stuff is very very important when you're

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,460
starting to get up towards that 10

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,130
second side so how do you choose

00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,290
durations right I mean obviously the

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,320
type of thing that you're animating does

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,360
help influence it basically if you have

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,250
to travel a greater distance or expand

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
to a greater size you probably want your

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,720
animation to take a little bit longer

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,400
right so people can process it if it's

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,510
closer to the area of central focus so

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,010
it's if it's happening right in the

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,480
middle of the screen you can probably

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,890
take a little bit less time because

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,180
people are staring at it if it's

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,670
happening on the periphery of the screen

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,160
maybe a little more time

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,840
people notice that it's happening but

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,950
anyway this this study by the the

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,660
Nielson group on the three important

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,860
time limits again the I I will have a

00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,030
link to all the slides so you don't have

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,620
to feel like you have to read these tiny

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,690
URLs that are kind of useless in

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,320
presentation mode they'll all be there

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,730
and you can and you can check it out

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,560
next transitions so there's several

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,390
different things that objects can do on

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,450
object can be persistent which means

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,460
that it stays on the screen stays on the

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,830
stage it can be incoming so it wasn't

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,410
there and then it enters the stage it

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,090
can be outgoing which means it leaves

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,530
the stage or it that makes sense or it

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,810
could be static which means it isn't

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,400
animated but it's still an object that

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,720
the other objects can interact with so

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
it's still important as part of the

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,840
animation these are these are basically

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,370
all of your different transitions I want

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,290
to talk a little bit about a cut

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,580
transition so this is something it

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,050
basically means it's not there's an

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,680
immediate change there is no transition

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,360
state change done right these are very

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,730
disorienting right the the problem here

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,530
there's a lack of orientation your brain

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,330
kind of internally resets as soon as it

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,040
changes and there's also a change

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,360
blindness because we we don't really

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,680
necessarily remember what was on the

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,160
previous screen so it's really hard to

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,230
see what actually changed specifically

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,060
problem is obviously much of the web is

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,220
powered by cuts right like you load a

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,960
new page in a traditional website like

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,500
that's a cut that's not an animation and

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,970
so that's why we need to do things like

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,710
be consistent between pages keep your

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,570
menus in the same spot keep your footers

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,160
in the same spot use a similar layout

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,260
guide people through what they're doing

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,090
because we have to deal with cuts and

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,470
right here you can see like these are

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,600
vastly different pages and it's kind of

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,580
like I you know like things are jumping

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,050
around and I don't know why and like

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,210
it's it's confusing I don't know what

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,650
changed so we want to try to mitigate

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,000
that as much as possible when we're

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,440
dealing with page changes and things

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,930
that we can't control the animation for

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,540
between great so here's a great example

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,060
of between multiple properties changing

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,370
at the same time right so we have color

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,130
change we have a shape change we have a

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,720
size change tweening is useful because

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,280
you can kind of tell where something

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,260
came from and where it's going right so

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,180
if I just clicked on the purple circle

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,980
and suddenly there was a white square

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,810
I wouldn't necessarily know the white

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,530
square came from the purple circle but

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,500
here it's

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,760
clear that they come from each other and

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,350
so that's why tweening is very very

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,510
useful and again you can't win between

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:15,350
any of those things that we talked about

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,850
earlier that you can animate so then

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,610
there's fading there's several different

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,290
kinds of fading you might see like a

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,880
dissolve which is a standard fade

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,580
basically something fades out and then

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,040
something fades in a cross divide is

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,050
where they're simultaneously fading so

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,430
one object might be fading out while

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,750
other one's fading in which means if you

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,570
kind of paused it in the middle you'd

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,130
see both of them a little bit there's

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,240
also a fast through sequential fade

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,800
which is basically a really quick

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,810
fade-out and really quick fade in so

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,150
just different kinds of fades that you

00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,490
can employ this was like just a cool

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,350
like layer based example that that

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,160
material design gave us about about

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,060
fades which was I just thought was nice

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,130
transformation this is one object

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,830
becoming another also known as morphing

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,570
this one this reminds me of all the

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,700
flash stuff that I used to do like oh

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,170
the first time we discovered oh you can

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,120
make a shape turn into another shape

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,970
this is so neat it does it for me how

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,850
cool so that's fun but probably

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,050
moderately useless however this example

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,970
with the button is actually a really

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,400
kind of nice example of transformation

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,840
to convey useful information right so

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,030
you've got your submit button you click

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,710
on it there's a progress bar and then it

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,840
turns into like a success state that's

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,950
actually a really cool useful form of

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,240
transformation to convey information

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,790
this is a very very overwhelming slide

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,150
that I don't expect you to digest but

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,670
there was a group that put together 12

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,050
principles of UX in motion so they kind

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,090
of roughly based it on the 12 principles

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,090
of animation they made it a lot more

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,710
specific to web interfaces like here are

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,290
some specific ways we can use animation

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,420
on the web the URL is UX in motion net

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,280
again the slides will be up so you can

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,780
see these URLs but I'd suggest digging

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,310
into that and taking a look at it I'm

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,780
not gonna go into detail about this they

00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,910
do a really good job of talking about it

00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,800
but these are probably some things that

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,520
you've seen before in animation on the

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,400
web so now that we know the elements of

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,880
animation and what we can animate how do

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,070
we then use animation semantically and

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,020
usefully so basically what what value

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,480
can all of this animation provide to us

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,340
now that we know how to do it

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,769
well one thing that animation is great

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,260
at is establishing contact through

00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:26,419
hierarchy it establishes basically

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,510
hierarchical and spatial relationships

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:31,340
you can see here the crane example you

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,750
know you click on your crane icon and

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,070
then the app kind of grows out of the

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,159
icon right so it's very it's

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,779
establishing hey this is the the parent

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,679
icon and this is the app that comes out

00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,929
of it

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,549
the example in here where you've got

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,080
your kind of list and then you click on

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:47,559
it and it grows out from that list

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,519
that's great because it's establishing

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,380
navigation between different layers and

00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,210
again it's also being used to direct

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,190
your attention to the important element

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,779
because it's growing out from that so I

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,010
just really like this because it was

00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,710
showing kind of this layer based

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,029
animation so that's what you would see

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,559
statically but this is kind of how it

00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,360
feels like you're looking at it you know

00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,100
material design is very layer based and

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,570
so you know you're clicking on a thing

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,980
and it brings a layer up to the surface

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,779
and then it brings it back down so

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,049
things that you can do with animation is

00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:16,549
establishing hierarchy there's also

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:17,960
several different kinds of relationships

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:21,139
that you can establish with the

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,269
animation one is the the tab just the

00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:25,070
tab - tab or the scrolling swiping

00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,720
there's a lot of scrolling and swiping

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,429
going on on the internet right now

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,960
especially mobile but these are

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,510
basically establishing peer-to-peer or

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,870
adjacent relationships that are equal so

00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,490
it's not hierarchical so for example the

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,760
the dogs and cats that's a great example

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,590
of like tabbed relationship a menu

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,480
button - a drop-down so if you click on

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,529
a button and a menu comes out of it

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,740
that's establishing that relationship

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:50,929
there or when you click on something and

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,549
a modal or a popover comes up like

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,940
establishing that relationship right

00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,409
there even toggles like accordions or

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,500
dropdowns that's a really great example

00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,570
of being able to use animation and

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,370
loading icons and placeholders to final

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,929
content that was something we talked a

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,760
little bit about with the duration if

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:10,190
something's going to take a while but a

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,779
lot of apps like Facebook or Twitter if

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,460
you load it kind of on a slow connection

00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,470
you'll see kind of that blank state

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,240
flashing at you but it's implying like

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,919
here's where the contents gonna go and

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,510
that's the useful way of establishing a

00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,860
relationship between the placeholder

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:26,179
content and the content that will

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,440
eventually be on the screen animations

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:30,679
can also be used to provide feedback

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,370
right so if I drag something I'm showing

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,870
hey I'm going to

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,790
this here and this is where it's going

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,790
to be everything rearranges so I can see

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,440
hey I'm doing something here if I add

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,850
this one's cool you add it to the cart

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,440
and it just like goes into the cart like

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,990
hey I added a thing to a cart right

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,080
that's providing useful feedback here

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,880
it's entering in a passcode and it's

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,170
shaking it's like no no no no you did it

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,790
wrong right that's a little bit of

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,970
feedback that it's giving just by using

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:58,310
animation and even here with the the

00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,750
check box it's very simple animation but

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,270
it's saying like yes you clicked on this

00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:05,060
box it is now checked so it's providing

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,950
feedback it's providing whether there's

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,630
a success or an error state whether

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,340
you're dragging or moving or hovering or

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,610
pressing these are really great ways to

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,340
use animation to provide feedback you

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,020
can use animation to indicate status so

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,680
like we talked about those pre state or

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,540
transition animations placeholders like

00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,500
loading new content like on Facebook or

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,840
Twitter when you're trying to load

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,520
something also the loading indicator if

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,080
you've got like an AJAX button to load

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,640
more posts at the bottom of a thing and

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,140
there's a little spinner that's a really

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,080
great example of indicating status

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,420
something's happening state changes

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,700
again stuff like on or off open or

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,950
closed selected or D selected focused or

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,700
unfocused enabled or disabled great

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,990
places to be able to indicate status

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,300
indicating progress is super great so

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,360
loading bars or pagination showing where

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,890
you're at in a stage and then indicating

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,380
the function of something so these are

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,170
all just like really fun examples of

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,130
indicating the status of something by

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,160
yeah like there's the loading thingy

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:08,270
it's like hey more stuffs gonna be here

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:11,300
yeah you can also use animation to give

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,340
instruction so this is it can be

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,440
anywhere from just a very simple like

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,570
that animation saying oh swipe to unlock

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,180
I understand like a jump so that you

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,610
know that you can swipe very simple it

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,260
can be as complicated as let's build

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,110
this whole entire like thing to teach

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,630
you how the app works slack does some of

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:32,300
that but like hey we built this whole

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,070
complicated thing it can be just a

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,540
pop-up that like shows up with like hey

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,430
here's an indication of the button

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,620
you're supposed to click on next it can

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,240
be a full walkthrough of your entire

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,670
thing it can just indicate where you're

00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,630
at in the process these are all really

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,110
great ways to be able to give

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,350
instruction

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,870
using animation and of course you can

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,210
use animation to add delight I just love

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,010
this juggling guy oh I could stare at

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,900
that forever he's so cute

00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,460
but it's it's giving it a little

00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,750
character right so it's loading and we

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,390
could have just had a normal loading bar

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,860
but instead we've got this guy juggling

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,030
cuz he's setting up your account oh but

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,640
he's really sad because something went

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,200
wrong oh no I don't know this is so fun

00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,270
the the crane has another good example

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,510
it's just a little bit of personality

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,670
this one again adding personality you

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,100
know you you kind of pull down and it

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,620
like shoots the airplane up and the

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,540
trees move like is it unnecessary yes

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,630
but it's fun and it fits whatever that

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,880
brand is doing and I absolutely just

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,130
love this loading bar indicator it's

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:37,160
like what's happening it's happening oh

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:39,020
no we all felt that before so fun ways

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,260
to add delight I want to talk a little

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,580
bit about the animation and how it's

00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,350
kind of been used to provide information

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,750
since the earliest visual output on

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,570
computers and this the flashing cursor

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,400
is like the first computer animation and

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,460
it conveys actually a whole lot of

00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,990
information with just this one thing

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,880
first of all it's conveying hierarchy

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,290
because it's telling you hey this is the

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,580
thing to look at this is the most

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,260
important thing on the screen right now

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,740
it's this is the one thing that's

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,120
flashing it's providing feedback the car

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,100
if the cursor moves while you're typing

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,470
that means hey cool I am typing and

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,929
therefore things are happening it

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,309
provides status if the cursor is still

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,570
flashing that means your computer's

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,700
still working because if it stops

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,210
flashing you're like oh something's

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,950
broken

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,540
it's supposed to be flashing and it's

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,700
also giving us instruction because it's

00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,080
like hey type here this is where you

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,940
this is where you interact so just this

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,370
this flashing cursor this really basic

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,720
thing it's conveying so much information

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,549
with animation it's now I want to talk a

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,110
little bit at the end here about using

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,460
animation responsibly because remember

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,470
at the beginning we talked about all

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,179
these problems the bloat the complexity

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,000
all this stuff all of these things were

00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:48,440
super super fun but how do we know when

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,610
we should be using them and when we

00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,520
shouldn't right so number one does your

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,990
animation add value prioritize

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,730
animations that will add value or

00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,950
especially multiple forms of value what

00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,500
do I

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:04,080
mean by that does your animation show

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,130
the user where information came from or

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,929
where it went to you know is it

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,990
conveying some kind of location doesn't

00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:11,730
indicate progress you know does it move

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,789
the user through an information space

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,809
does it reinforce physics or branding

00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:17,789
like does it make sense with what you're

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,380
doing does it explain something faster

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,970
than words or a video could sometimes

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,409
some of those instructional things it's

00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,210
like a little bit of animation goes a

00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,159
lot better than trying to make users

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,460
read a document so does it add value

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,230
first question second question are your

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,899
animation behaviors consistent across

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,330
your entire site it's better user

00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,740
experience right to adopt consistent

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,840
animation patterns because then

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,580
everything behaves as expected if I

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,200
interact with something one way on one

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,200
page I should be able to interact with

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,269
it similarly on another page but also

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,100
it's a more streamlined and more

00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:51,960
maintainable code base when you reuse

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,279
animation components right and so we

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,230
want to be able to load as few things as

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,240
possible we don't need to be super

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,090
creative every single time we want to

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,350
maybe establish a library of patterns so

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,820
this is why we want to know is our

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:08,159
animation behavior consistent is is it

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,309
still functional without it right it may

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,260
not be as delightful or as easy but we

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,210
want to offer an alternative or feedback

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,529
so we don't want our animation to be

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,409
mission-critical through the thing

00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:21,990
working especially if your animation is

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:23,490
done by cutting-edge CSS that maybe not

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,010
is not supported in every single browser

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,539
or it's done by JavaScript we want all

00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,559
of our actions to still be functional

00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,809
without it because again we don't

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,549
necessarily know how people are browsing

00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,309
our website and the point is to enhance

00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:37,230
not to cut people off from accessing

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:38,429
something so remember to make sure that

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,990
things are functional without your

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:41,730
animation even though your animation

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,380
does add value and does make it a better

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:48,090
experience for traditional navigation

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,380
right also is it optimised consider what

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,450
you're trying to animate consider how

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,460
complex it is it is it a super complex

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,289
SVG file where you're trying to do all

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,019
of these things all at once are you

00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,080
trying to parallax scrolling byte photo

00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,519
up your screen why are you doing that

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,409
how many paths are you trying to element

00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,049
animate how many things you're animating

00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,669
it once what's going on we want to try

00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,080
to limit what we need to render we want

00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,490
to try to limit the size of things that

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,809
we're interacting with so just try to

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,110
optimize it as best as

00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:19,289
possible and the last one is do you need

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,789
it um don't do it if you don't need it I

00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,529
mean if you have a good reason if you

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,690
can point to why you're doing something

00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:26,429
and it's compelling do it but don't do

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,720
it if you don't need it don't do it just

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,070
because it's cool don't do it just

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,749
because you saw it somewhere I mean do

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,120
it on your own to practice it because

00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:35,100
you saw it somewhere but don't do it for

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,379
like production-ready sites there's a

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,379
really great quote about this that I saw

00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:42,450
in the book animation at work which was

00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:46,019
don't make something unless it's both

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,909
necessary and useful but if it is both

00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,309
necessary and useful don't hesitate to

00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:52,549
make it beautiful right so my takeaway

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,600
from that is you know be pragmatic first

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,100
but if it is something that you do need

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,139
if you have gone through those questions

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,080
and established that you do it do you

00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:03,809
need it do it purposefully and do it

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,220
well here's something that's super

00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,379
useless to you right now because it's

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,639
tiny but I will give you the link to all

00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:10,649
the slides these are a whole bunch of

00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:12,330
really great resources to learn a little

00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:13,860
bit more about the principles of

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,529
animation especially as they relate to

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,619
the web the first two are great CSS

00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,970
animation dot rocks which is all of

00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:22,950
those twelve principles of animation but

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,480
done in pure CSS so you can take a look

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,389
at that that's fun and then jank-free

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,249
org because we want to not have janky

00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:33,990
websites so this is the final slide of

00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:35,999
official content here's how to get in

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,110
touch with me that's my email I'm mark

00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,299
time media basically everywhere on the

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,460
Internet easy to find this is the link

00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:48,450
to the slides so I will just Vanna White

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:49,799
this okay where to find me next so I'm

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,710
gonna hang out right now and answer

00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,419
questions until the end of the session

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,039
after this I'm going to be hanging out

00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,320
in the site ground booth because I'm a

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,549
site grown ambassador and so I I you

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,889
know get to do a bunch of fun stuff with

00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,659
them so come say hi to me otherwise I'll

00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:06,119
be in the hallway track I'll maybe be in

00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,499
some sessions I maybe be randomly

00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,749
exercising I don't know I do that

00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:11,249
sometimes online I've been on a lot of

00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:13,230
podcasts you might see me around if you

00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:15,659
have a podcast you need a guest I like

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,730
talking so that sounds fun and in person

00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:19,679
the next word camp I'll be at officially

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,659
is word camp Minneapolis but otherwise

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:27,340
I'll be here throughout the rest of the

00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:29,210
day so cool good ending

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,940
yeah great

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:35,799
applause for all of you because you sat

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,799
in this hot room with me that was fun

00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:04,940
okay so you're talking about using

00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:09,169
animation on your site I want to clarify

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:13,399
so are you on wordpress.com okay

00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:15,829
so being able to customize wordpress.com

00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,470
is a question that I'm not super

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:20,690
qualified to answer just because I I do

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,720
all custom development you know dot-org

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,800
self hosted stuff maybe something

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,210
especially if you've upgraded to a

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,919
higher plan you probably have a higher

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,240
tier of support and so that's probably

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,579
something really great to ask them about

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,159
like hey my may I have animation it

00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:37,129
seems very slow is there anything that I

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,230
can do because they they kind of control

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:41,500
all of the server-side stuff that you so

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,000
I mean I would say talk talk to them

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,149
yeah yeah that's that's why you pay them

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,169
the money so like use it good all right

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:50,169
awesome yes

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:07,630
sure so the question is about using

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,890
animated gifts and or gifs in I'm gonna

00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,400
say it both ways because I don't want to

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:15,250
take a side in newsletters and whether

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,890
there is a a compelling source of them

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,410
that well okay so I mean I think they're

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,450
inherently kind of supposed to be lame a

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,700
little bit but most and they're also

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,740
going to be kind of big and hard to

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,319
download just because they're multiple

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,569
frames as opposed to one but I think if

00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:33,700
you look into and I don't have a

00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:36,849
specific resource for you but if you

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,549
look more into like motion photography

00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:41,380
as opposed to to looking for it like

00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:43,450
usually if you're looking for that

00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,539
you're gonna find like memes and like

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,770
dorky like let's recut this anime into

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,839
this other thing you like that kind of

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,450
stuff which I find hilarious

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,369
but I think if you look more into motion

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,349
photography type stuff it's more classy

00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,390
they're usually kind of trying to play

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,520
with the whole dimensionality of stuff

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,230
so maybe look into that I don't have a

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,309
great resource because I like I like the

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:09,010
dorky ones so that's cool

00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:10,329
and it yes sure any other questions they

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,190
don't even have to be about design I

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,720
mean about UX necessarily I could talk

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,630
about design I could talk about whatever

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:20,349
you want this is like free free design

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:22,770
advice nobody wants free advice that's

00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:22,770
fine Oh

00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,380
do you have you done any work experience

00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:38,080
I haven't actually

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,910
so most of most of what I'm doing is

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,620
very like low-level UX experiential I

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,500
follow a lot of really awesome animation

00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:50,770
people on Twitter one a couple people

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,410
that I would recommend following one

00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:57,420
woman her name is Val head vlh on

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:59,710
Twitter she's fantastic another one

00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,060
eunuch rabbits I can't remember what her

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,230
I think it's just like you know it's

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,780
like really easy but anyway they're both

00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,490
like super super smart people and that's

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,860
where I get all my like super cool

00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,630
inspiration from I'm not doing anything

00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,890
cutting-edge although I'm aware of what

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,520
you're talking about

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:18,550
but yeah the world is your Twitter

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,300
oyster I guess I don't know terrible

00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:25,510
answer to your question cool yeah no

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,460
that's yeah yep there's a lot of really

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,890
awesome cutting-edge stuff and I cannot

00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,140
believe that so much is possible on the

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,780
web nowadays it's amazing I am like

00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,110
really sweaty it is hot in here cool I
