00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,980
the clicker there we go

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,440
Who am I I'm a coder of Adcock creative

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,100
group with my husband I've been a

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,230
full-time freelancer for nine years I

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,359
wish I could say I decided to quit the

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,900
corporate world and become a freelancer

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,420
I got laid off in 2010 and woohoo yeah

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,299
and the great thing about that I

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,900
actually say the happiest day of my life

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,200
was November 16 2010 the day I got laid

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:24,330
off because I would have never had the

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,299
courage to do this and I haven't looked

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,790
back and I'm glad to say that last year

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:35,400
I earned four times what I was making in

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,680
my last job and just got rid of that

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
client the client that laid me off of

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,729
course didn't realize that they needed

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,329
an IT person and a web person when they

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,950
laid me off so they hired me back and I

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,570
gave him a price because I didn't want

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,369
to work for him anymore and they took it

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,130
so but they are actually as of last

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,729
night no longer my client ironically I'm

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,079
working now with their competitor and

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,960
they've been a speaker at WordCamp

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,930
Atlanta many times word camp Miami and

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,610
word can't Birmingham just a little plug

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,400
for word camp Birmingham that's in

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,240
August it's a smaller word camp but the

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,760
quality of speakers is like Atlanta

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,650
but only on a smaller scale my there's

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,690
my email address Melanie dad cut

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,840
creative group and I'm also the

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,760
organizer of the new meetup in Newton so

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,880
we've just started having meetups our

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,190
next one will be at the end of May so

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,540
don't go to meetup calm and join our

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,750
list if you feel like driving to Noonan

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:43,200
okay why this session you should always

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,190
do a session on things you hate doing so

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,340
you get better at it

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,320
I hate writing proposals I've always

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,520
hated write but I love you you're

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,500
getting off the phone you're real

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,200
excited about this project you know you

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,700
just hit it off at the client you know

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,980
they're gonna choose you

00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,910
they've said it over the phone it sounds

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,460
perfect

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,100
send me a proposal you get off the phone

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:09,270
and now you've got to write the proposal

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:13,260
and that is why this talk I hate writing

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:17,220
proposals I'd avoid it oh well really I

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,390
need to do laundry well I really need to

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,750
do these client tasks I really need to

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,280
do fill in the blank because I hate it

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,970
but I always give my client you will

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,720
have a proposal by this date because I

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,540
have to do that so I'll write it and I

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,330
don't keep putting it off so when I hate

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,140
doing something I try to figure out how

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,459
to make it faster and how to automate it

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,739
so that is what I worked on the last

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,730
year so I'm here to share what I've

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:55,110
learned okay a proposal versus a quote

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,480
if your sin sending a sheet of paper

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,130
with a bunch of lines with all the

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,360
things you're going to do with with

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,840
prices next to it

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,730
that's a quote that's a laundry list

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,350
that they can get out their red pen say

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,600
well I really don't need this much I

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,610
really don't need that and they they

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,900
actually set a lower price for

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:19,260
themselves a proposal positioned you as

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,970
an expert it is going to be a a general

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,450
outline of everything that you're going

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,040
to do not how you're going to do it but

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,170
what you're going to do and it

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,350
presents the value of the service that

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,530
you're providing because you're not the

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,350
technician to do exactly what they want

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:44,100
you're you're there to do the best for

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:47,860
what the goal they want to reach and

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,280
what's not included avoid technical

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,050
terms

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,980
I mentioned WordPress one time that's in

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,990
my contract

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,200
that I'm using the WordPress content

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,660
management system to do that I'm not

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,120
listing the plugins I'm going to use I

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,180
may say I'm going to set up a membership

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,720
system but I'm not saying I'm using min

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,780
barium or I'm setting up an online

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,510
learning system I'm not saying I'm going

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,460
to use learn - because what happens if

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,670
you figure out they they have a change

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,770
request and now you figured the best way

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,720
to handle that change requests is not to

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,610
use learn - but to use WooCommerce

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,200
sensei but you already said in the

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,950
proposal that you were going to use this

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,880
so I keep things of what I'm going to do

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,350
not how I'm going to do it and don't you

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,410
know like don't list plugins by name

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,870
don't itemize costs unless you're

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,820
breaking the project down into phases

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,480
and you can send say this is the

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,190
proposal for phase one the price this is

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,550
for phase two we're going to do this

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,840
phase three we're going to do this and

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,000
that way they can see what the total

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,970
price is but you're not giving them the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,880
option of crossing things out okay what

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,130
to include now this is just suggestions

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,920
a lot of this comes from WP elevation

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,880
I'm a member of WP elevation I have been

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,030
for four to five years if you don't know

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,990
what WP elevation is run by Troy Dean it

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:27,790
is a online course and support system

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,120
for WordPress freelancers basically it

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,220
teaches you how to run your business and

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,780
I learned so much on that I also have a

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,240
personal business coach in a lot of

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,240
you've probably watched Nathan Ingram's

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,110
talk on tape taming the whirlwind Nathan

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,229
my coach my business coach so he's my

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,090
one-on-one business coach and so I've

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,560
taken what I've learned from Nathan I've

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,180
taken what I've learned from WP

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,669
elevation I've taken from I've learned

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,509
from webinars here in their word camps

00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:00,880
and kind of put it all into one place I

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:03,430
do a business app snapshot this tells me

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,240
I actually listen to the client when

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,250
they told me about their business I

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,530
listen I ask all the questions that I

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,500
need the answers to to write the

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,889
proposal so I say tell me about your

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,590
business tell me about your ideal client

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,720
tell me about the client that you get

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,819
the most of it's an online store you

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,590
know what's your demographic I do a lot

00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,069
of churches I'm known as the church lady

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,080
so I do a lot of churches so on one of

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,520
my questions for churches well tell me

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,220
about your congregation what's the

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,340
demographic what demographic are you

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,919
trying to reach with this website you

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,080
know we'll come up with a plan for that

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,490
so I actually take what they've told me

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,810
and I write it up in the business

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,460
snapshot that says I listen to them

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,139
business needs and target audience needs

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,210

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,090
website and that's like two or three

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,210
bullet points usually it's not like an

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,860
essay it is just are they getting more

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,310
because they are making investment in

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,800
their business so this is what they are

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,860
investing in and that's where I just

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,860
list out the prices and the optional

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,930
upgrades so I'll say ok this project is

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,720
this

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,870
I offer premium WordPress hosting with

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,500
WP engine or liquid web that's this much

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,290
a year then I say ok well they I have

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,780
monthly maintenance plans they start at

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:48,970
$99 a month at $99 you get this much at

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:52,660
$1.99 you get this much at $4.99 you get

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,910
this and I so this they're not hearing

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,950
weight maintenance plans after launch

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,080
well you have to pay me money to take

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,140
care of your website I've talked to them

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,480
about that from day one then also

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,240
include a copy of my contract if you're

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,970
not using a contract shame on you steal

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,700
mine start using it make it your own

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:18,370
you've got to protect yourself ok let's

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,110
go ahead and this is what I talked about

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,910
let the client write it if you know what

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,400
your going to be putting and how your

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,190
proposals written you know the questions

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,890
to ask because you're going to ask them

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,470
all the questions so you'll have all the

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,150
answers and you can whip out a proposal

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,950
you don't have to sit there and think

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,800
about it because they've given you all

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,680
the information so I have an interview

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,300
list before I meet but I have a cheat

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,170
sheet one I use for retirement

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,700
communities I've done a lot of

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,980
retirement communities so I have a whole

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,860
list for that I do a lot of churches so

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,860
I have my church list and then I have my

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,990
regular when they've cold called me or

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,120
I've gotten a referral then I do a

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,790
little research then I write up a list

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,860
and what so when I talk to them on the

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,570
phone for the first time I have a list

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,030
of questions that's going to help me

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,939
write that proposal I also have a

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,339
website work

00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:12,079
cheat on my website it's actually

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:15,709
straight from WP elevation I really

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,919
haven't changed it all that much but it

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:21,439
it's I've actually had people go right

00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,599
to my website fill that thing out and

00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,119
the first contact I've ever had with

00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:28,369
them was all the information I needed to

00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,379
write the proposal and I get on their

00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:32,929
contact information and call them after

00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,209
I've gone through it made my list of

00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:37,249
questions set a time to talk to them

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,429
call them and we take it from there

00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:43,129
I get that mostly from churches I only

00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:46,639
write a proposal if I have a chance I

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:50,629
asked them used to scare the bejeebies

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,879
out of me to ask people their budget it

00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,069
how many people still afraid to ask how

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,669
much they're willing to spend okay

00:11:55,069 --> 00:12:01,249
that's like my third question what's

00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:03,829
your budget for this project sometimes

00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:06,139
I'm surprised when they say well we're

00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,789
only able to spend you know eight to ten

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,799
thousand dollars for this website if you

00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:11,379
like doing a little happy dance you know

00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:16,519
when it's just a little Church website

00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:17,720
or you you do you know what is the

00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,669
budget well we don't really want to

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,769
spend more than $50,000 and you're like

00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,179
you know try not to look like you're

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,779
gonna have a stroke and the chair across

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,169
from them but you're like wow that's

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,869
great

00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:32,529
now if I hadn't asked that I probably

00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:35,479
would have totally underbid that that

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,459
job but you also get to handle it for

00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:41,269
people who have unrealistic expectations

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:45,949
I only have a budget of $500

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,509
well my base site my base price for a

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:51,769
church site is around five thousand

00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:54,529
dollars so let's go ahead and talk about

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,449
your project and what you need and then

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,809
I'm gonna give you some suggestions of

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:02,269
how you can accomplish that task or at

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,459
least get started with that budget nine

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,679
times out of the ten I still get that

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,720
project because I'm willing to talk to

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,739
them willing to at least point them in

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,869
the right direction

00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:13,849
and they're like when they go say oh

00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:18,829
well I have to go do it all myself you

00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:20,869
know at Wix or Squarespace or I'm I

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:21,649
don't really want to do that but you

00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,110
know I know

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:26,600
much it's probably gonna cost because I

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,160
she's given me a ballpark around $5,000

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,079
we'll just go back we'll find the money

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,100
and we'll go back back to her and she

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,829
can do it all so I don't waste time on

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,420
tire kickers if I'm gonna be competing

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:47,869
you know to the lowest common

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:50,059
denominator proposals when I first

00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:53,689
started using an online system I used

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,699
the bid sketch and then I switched over

00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:58,929
to better proposals because they had a

00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:03,009
lifetime deal on appSumo for $39 and

00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:06,379
that was about two three years ago and

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,970
so I jumped on that and I really really

00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,040
really liked it liked it a lot better

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,990
than bids mid sketch but there's

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,290
proposed a Phi there are so many

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:18,050
different systems for that and I'll have

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,339
a list for you later on I'm going to go

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:27,259
ahead and show you let me escape from

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:31,100
here and show you better proposals let

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:33,050
me get this make a bigger here now what

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,639
I do because I do a lot of retirement

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,160
communities and I do a lot of churches I

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:42,350
actually have I did a proposal and then

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,540
I created a template out of it and just

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,059
made everything generic so when I go to

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,309
do a retirement community I just spin up

00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:53,389
a copy of it and make the changes add

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:54,910
and subtract things and I could do a rep

00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,470
proposal in about 20 minutes

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,990
the fastest one I've done was the one I

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,589
just did for a church in South Florida

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,759
I actually timed myself seven minutes

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:14,240
from start to finish

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:17,389
eight thousand dollar job so and so

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,240
let's go ahead and get into oh sorry I

00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:24,889
can't see there we go

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,480
here's an example this is a retirement

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:31,879
community example you put your branding

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,070
in you can pick a background image load

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,040
up anything that you want

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,740
and I put the title who it's written

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,260
written by and then they start reading

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,160
and I'm going to show you the what the

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:49,250
client sees first it basically takes

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,630
them in and you can see all the things I

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:57,140
did the snapshot the business needs and

00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:00,050
target needs solution I actually input a

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,880
project timeline in there because like

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,460
that's one of the questions I get a lot

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,350
is well how long is this going to take

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,600
I want to make it very clear to the

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,940
client that once we get to a certain

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,620
point and I need stuff from them content

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,420
images then it's in their ballpark so if

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,480
they delay in that it's going to delay

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,400
in the timeline the investment the

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,350
mutual agreement which is the contract

00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,570
and then how do they sign so this one

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,840
you know I just generically named of

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,970
community that is energetic carefree

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,860
independent retirement lifestyle blah

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,830
blah blah and this is stuff that they

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,290
told me so I wrote it up or you could

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,110
get it off their current website if they

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,860
have one then I go on to the business

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,750
and target audience needs I list the the

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,330
business needs now they actually had

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,660
they have a really really really old

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,480
website like we're talking ten years old

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,520
and they needed a lot of new features

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,130
and these are the things that they

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,350
wanted to be added to their website and

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,360
then the target audience is only five

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,520
bullet points it's got to be easy to

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,320
navigate because most of their clients

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,570
are like over 70 improved experience in

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,660
mobile because right now they don't have

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:24,170
that at all access to information about

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,020
services just very generic of what we're

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,380
going to solve and then the solution the

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:33,070
scope of work this is what we're going

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,540
to do there's my wordpress right there I

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,770
mentioned WordPress there and I mention

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,750
in my contract but it's just a list of

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,640
what we're going to do we're going to do

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,590
a custom web design we're going to make

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,240
it mobile-friendly we're going to add a

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,610
social media stack we're

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,980
going to do an email signup system I'm

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:57,830
not talking about how I'm just talking

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,900
about what we're going to do basic

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,450
search engine optimization I'm an I do

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,700
that on every site that I do but I also

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,010
make them understand what the difference

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,679
is between when I walk through this with

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,679
them that basic search engine

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,559
optimization so and they don't know the

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,700
difference so you have to educate them

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,510
on it additional things that we're going

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,760
to do the the you know Google search

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,750
console Google Analytics the stuff that

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,330
you're going to connect the sitemaps all

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,160
that stuff so then I go into the project

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,840
timeline I let them know that it's going

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,660
to take two weeks to do the design it's

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,250
going to take four weeks of development

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,260
one week of revisions one week of

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,000
testing that's kind of a general

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,990
guideline that I walk through and I made

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,370
this very very generic for this sample

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:10,340
and then the investment how much is the

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:12,590
the website what is the hosting going to

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,809
cost them what is the monthly period

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,120
well what's the recommended monthly care

00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,920
plan depending on what I talked they

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,030
just need me to keep the website updated

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,910
WordPress plugins and they're going to

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,400
add everything I would recommend my $99

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,679
a month plan if they need me to be

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,130
actively involved that starts at the

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,020
$2.99 if they want a webmaster at their

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,750
beck and call that starts at $4.99 a

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,850
month and goes up if they have more than

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,790
one website then you know they may be

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,330
spending $1,000 a month $2,500 a month

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,510
it all depends on their needs you know

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,860
if they want that priority access to me

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,809
they want to be able to pick up the

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,870
phone and call me instead of sending me

00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:00,740
an email that's not a 99 dollar a month

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,400
plan that's a that's an email me support

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,220
ticket

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,250
plan if they want to be able to call me

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:11,390
they're going at any time during regular

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,440
business hours they need to pay a little

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:21,170
bit extra for that

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:23,240
and then my contract is what my proposal

00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,040
I kind of bait breaks everything down

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,490
now here's some key things to actually

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,800
keep adding to it it's a ever changing

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,720
thing because you always meet that

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,690
client that makes you think oh I need to

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,510
put that in my contract to kind of keep

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,060
them in your box that you set out for

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,940
them what's my pros oh what's the time

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,370
frame do they want a rush job well

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,300
you're gonna pay 45% more if you want

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:54,910
like it done in two weeks because that's

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:57,440
a rush job now this used to be I

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,630
actually have one of these it's an

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,910
abandoned project it's like four years

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:06,610
old a rabbit farm in Ohio I think they

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,070
just wanted a website because they

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,250
wanted to sell the farm but they just

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,930
kind of disappeared so if you ever have

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,960
clients that disappear then have a

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:20,870
suspended and banded project clause in

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,090
your proposal if you don't hear you

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,940
email them an update like every Friday

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,040
open projects I email them on Friday let

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,470
them know what I've done and I don't

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,320
hear back from them for a month so if I

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,650
don't hear back to them for from month

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,650
you know it's considered or actually say

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,710
say paid I have a different one

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:46,550
different let's see within 30 days I

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:49,160
don't hear you know crickets nothing for

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:52,400
30 days then the it's a suspended

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,350
project for me to pick that back up they

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,460
pay the other half because I asked for

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,950
half up front on most projects really

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,790
big projects we do with 30 30 you know

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,310
33 33 34 but if I don't hear from them

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,780
they pay the other half before we pick

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,250
it back up because I want to make sure

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,170
I'm going to eventually get paid for

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,790
that project if they're going to go go

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:20,549
dark again if I don't hear from

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:22,320
in 120 days it's abandoned done over you

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:25,710
know do not pass go do not collect huh

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,740
it's basically a new job I talk about

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,720
development revisions you have the

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,280
people that never want the website to be

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,880
done because they have one more change

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,710
so I have two rounds of revisions after

00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,520
that we go live if you're on a care plan

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,470
we can do some tweaks for 30 days so

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:48,120
what's going to happen at launch okay

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:52,200
compatibility current current browser

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,990
versions so if the company happens to be

00:22:52,200 --> 00:23:00,030
running you know Internet Explorer 10

00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:02,669
and Windows XP you know we're we're

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,679
designing it for the latest you know the

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:09,600
latest version of PHP the latest version

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:12,210
of my sequel the latest browsers because

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,460
you might have a client that needs it to

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,980
be supported in an older browser it does

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,429
happen every once in a while what what

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,679
did they need changes after launch well

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:25,380
I give them a 30 day you kind of a 30

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:29,160
day grace period before the monthly care

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,850
plan kicks in that we do simple changes

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,059
things that take less than 30 minutes or

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,309
you can set it is 15 minutes it's not

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,799
you know well I want a membership system

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:43,020
yeah no that's not going to happen

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,360
that's not a that is not in the scope of

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,590
work we're going to make tweaks change

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,690
images tweet text things like that just

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,520
because it's not working the client the

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,750
way the client expected as far as a

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,100
system on there does not make it a bug

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,900
so I actually define what a bug is a bug

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,780
is when something is not working it's an

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,120
error in program a fatal error you get

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,000
you know something across the top my

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,919
head recently with muddy prints so that

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,130
isn't that as an error that needs to be

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,130
fixed

00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:21,880
you have issues after updates to

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,100
WordPress third-party

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,490
codes you know different things like

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,460
that now here's a big one use of

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,520
third-party images of photography if you

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,870
are not asking your clients where they

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,350
got the images that they sent you shame

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,060
on you

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,260
you need to ask them what the Providence

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,540
is where did you get this image and if

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,540
they start with it well I looked on

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,940
Google I did a search I did a search for

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,610
copyright free images on Google and I

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,780
got all these from here no I won't touch

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,940
him with a ten-foot pole

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:02,170
I actually offer stock photography as

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,510
part of my price of one image per page

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,530
because I have a subscription to I stock

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:10,150
and I get the credits on appSumo and the

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,690
different deals they have with deposit

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,790
photos so I have a wide selection plus

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,570
I've been doing this for 15 years so I

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,760
have quite a stock photography library

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,910
and I'd much rather use a stock

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,770
photography I don't know where they got

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,230
that image and that happened just this

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,900
week I had a client send me a picture of

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,900
a park where they wanted to have me use

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,630
it for anything it and I'm like oh and I

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,130
just happened because they're there us

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,750
retainer client where'd you get the

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,410
picture this is a great picture where

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:48,940
who took the picture we got it off their

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:52,950
website and I'm like I can't use it and

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:56,680
they sold well it's a public website and

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:59,110
I said well all websites are public if

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,770
you can get to them does it mean you can

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,330
use the picture well we really want to

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,970
use this picture I said well then get on

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,890
the phone and call call them it was a

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,260
local park get on the photo call them

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,640
and ask them for permission and get it

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,520
in writing and then I'll use it well you

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,760
know it's on their website they kept

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,440
like I am not going to do it if if you

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,570
really really really want me to put it

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,320
on there I'm going to send you a piece

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,480
of paper that says you acknowledge that

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,120
this picture was sniped off the internet

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,830
and that you know that there's possible

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,720
copyright infringement if you put it on

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,730
the website and I'm not holding a

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,940
creative group liable for that in any

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:45,720
way shape or form so when you get sued

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:49,920
or if you get sued it's all on you

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,840
it is not on me well you know don't just

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,430
tell us to take it down I said well not

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,750
if it's a Getty image they're gonna send

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:59,940
you a bill and they don't do a cease and

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,530
desist which is the normal train of

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,420
thing they just send you a bill from

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,040
some random random amount like two

00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,660
thousand ten thousand whatever and then

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,290
you get on the phone you're gonna pay

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:13,560
something I'm not gonna pay anything so

00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:16,740
why I said well it's like two miles from

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,680
where you are why at lunch do you not

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,340
just drive down to the park with your

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:28,620
iPhone and take a picture and then send

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,930
it to me well that's a great idea so I'm

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,550
like I'm not gonna deal with that so

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,080
that is probably one of the biggest

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,000
thing if you have not heard at the

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,040
getting letter Google that write a

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,430
little note Google the Getty letter

00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,010
because Gettys like ruthless when it

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:47,150
comes to people using their images and

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,230
not having which is iStockphoto

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:52,820
ironically which I have a subscription

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,820
to yes

00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:04,870
it's in there it's in there yes it's in

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,970
there but they're a very client they're

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,130
like my biggest retainer client but I

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,780
I'm after them all the time churches are

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,780
like the worst at stealing stuff

00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,510
I think there's a church in the middle

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,860
of nowhere that comes up with all these

00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,430
original ideas and all the other

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:24,130
churches copy it so I see it all the

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,630
time I'm a member of Facebook groups

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,540
with churches and I don't know at least

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,810
once a week I'm like you can't do that

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,790
well they go with my new word nonprofit

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,740
yeah it just means that they're just

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,300
gonna go after you and you can you

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,100
afford a hundred and fifty thousand

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,900
dollar fine per image no I actually even

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,460
I actually was the photographer on a

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:50,140
project of HOA in Florida hired me to

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,710
build them a website I built the website

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,930
it was done and then I waited well they

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:59,170
changed management companies like the

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:02,500
month I finished the website well I had

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,700
gone to their community and I took all

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,280
the pictures because they couldn't

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:10,630
provide me to have their logo so I

00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:14,830
recreated their logo I did all the

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,180
pictures well they decided that that

00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,320
they were just gonna let them use the

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,940
management company because they were

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,230
going to give them a free website like

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,960
what you still have to pay me and

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,170
they're like yeah well we'll pay it but

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,510
this gives us this and this and this and

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:34,330
and I'm like okay and they were like

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:37,960
well we want to use all your futures I'm

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,260
like well I took them so I just can't

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,570
give them to you I'll sell them to you

00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,650
because they actually and so I went

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,970
through this I actually gave them a

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,580
documentation that gave them the right

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,170
to use my pictures because I took them

00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,540
and that way I actually went on in red

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,580
right in so they're just like general

00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,200
Tsin general Florida pictures because if

00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,190
somebody else starts using them you know

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,070
they're my pictures I took them and then

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,320
you get into some terms of use and other

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:10,040
leap who owns it I mean WordPress is

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:15,170
general license so they don't own the

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:18,140
code plug-in license and updates okay I

00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:22,310
use a lot of premium plugins and this is

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,500
how I do it if it's if it's a unlimited

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:28,040
license for instance I have gravity

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,840
forms it goes on every side I build I do

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,880
not charge the clients for it because I

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,520
have a developer license I put it on

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,690
every site say with beaver builder but

00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,000
if it's a specific plug-in that has a

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,820
renewal of every year that's specific to

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,690
their website then if they're on a care

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,450
plan that is included I will pay it if

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,620
they choose not to they get to use that

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,840
for a year

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,260
that's part of the fee because I count

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,910
that in when I do the the amount but

00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,750
after a year they gotta get their own

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:04,490
license and I spell that out and I

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,800
actually tell them when it comes to

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,260
comes time I figured out which ones it's

00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,150
gonna be it might be a whoop-whoop

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,900
commerce plugins we know how affordable

00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:16,820
those are and/or it might be event

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,160
ticket plus or it might be something

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,580
that that is a fairly significant plugin

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,010
or a big membership plug-in then I don't

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,370
want to keep eating that cause if they

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,830
are not a care plan so if their care

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,930
plan then on the care plan even in 99

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:36,350
I'll pick up the cost because that's

00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:39,350
part of them working with me and then on

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,920
web site security you cannot guarantee

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,470
that a site isn't

00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:48,980
gonna get hacked I've had one site

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:51,960
hacked and that was the owners password

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,480
it was a very very simple password when

00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,420
he had me set up the password I told him

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,050
it's too simple well it's easy for me to

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,570
remember I'm like okay but when it gets

00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,570
hacked it's going to be extra for me to

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,550
clean this off and of course yeah it got

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,090
hacked it took about three years but it

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:15,090
got hacked and I knew right away because

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,640
where I was using wordfence and it it

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,960
immediately told me when in I changed

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,070
his password to something about that

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:28,980
long and cleaned it all off send him a

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:32,220
bill and then do reinforce the extra but

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,510
now he knows the importance of strong

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:40,530
passwords hosting I like to work with a

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:44,340
set of reliable hosts if you've got

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:46,950
Bob's hosting and I actually had a

00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,100
church I had a local hosting company who

00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:55,170
had absolutely no idea what they were

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,570
doing and they didn't have half the PHP

00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,400
libraries they had in there and it was

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,220
just a mess it was a pain to deal with

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,920
it's like dealing with uploading to

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:09,420
GoDaddy I always have issues when I try

00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:12,450
to put it on GoDaddy so I actually list

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,310
these are my recommended hosts if you're

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,290
using something I'm not familiar with

00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,940
I'm not going to guarantee that the

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:22,140
site's going to run the way it does in

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:25,770
development because I have no idea what

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,600
that host provides up set ups sign

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,960
updates and backups if you're not on

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,000
care plan it's up to you to be

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,710
responsible then I go into what is a

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,460
care plan here's my offer basic business

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,500
in priority care you know how do you pay

00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,160
for it

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,860
cancellation at any

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,030
I'm third-party services if you get some

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,500
marketing company to go in there and do

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,190
stuff to the website and they screw it

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,670
up I'm not responsible to fix that that

00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:04,050
is gonna that's beyond the care plan

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:07,020
email deliverability I'm not getting my

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:10,380
contact form information it's going to

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,630
my spam box my users aren't getting the

00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,429
information well one of the things I do

00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,790
for almost all my clients is I set up

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,260
mailgun I do a third party email service

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,020
and I work with them to set up an

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,940
account and that way when they get

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,580
somebody that says they're not receiving

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:30,660
the emails you can actually go on the

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,380
mail gun and I said well yeah they got

00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:38,429
it they opened it at 9:30 8:00 a.m. so

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,990
they did get it and they're like you can

00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,900
tell that on there I'm like here let me

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:44,730
show you how how you do that and it

00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,450
stops all the email deliverability

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,210
issues pretty easy to set up they have a

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,440
free level they're one of the few

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:56,250
third-party email services that still

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,440
have a free level yeah if you're in

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:02,550
trouble with the law I'm gonna give them

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,620
what they need domain names it's their

00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,500
responsibility if you don't renew their

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,350
domain name I always ask for them to

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,730
make me an admin on their domain --let

00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,530
if they have their own domain name I

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,800
prefer them to be responsible for their

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:19,590
domain name but I want to get emailed

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,050
when things are getting close to

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,970
renewing just a reminder that this is

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,610
coming up for renewal so when you get

00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:29,370
the bill from GoDaddy to pay it and this

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,350
also gives me a chance to say okay about

00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,150
six months out from your domain name

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,330
renewing you're gonna start getting eat

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,580
getting real snail mail from the domain

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,040
registry of America or one of those

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,660
other scammy things where they send you

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,490
a bill for a domain name they don't

00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,830
you're not registered with I actually

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,180
tell my clients about that so said

00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,610
whenever you get something that requires

00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,930
your attention about your

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,140
take two seconds to pick up the phone

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,790
call me and ask me if it's real and nine

00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,410
times out of ten if it came in the mail

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,420
it's not real

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,190
GoDaddy isn't if you're registered at

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,380
GoDaddy go deaf he's never gonna send

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,540
you snail mail to tell you that your

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,260
domain is expiring now they'll send you

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,330
ten thousand emails started six months

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:17,020
out but they're not gonna send you a

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:20,500
letter and even about the attribution

00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:23,410
link indentification if they're going to

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,620
sue me they're coming to noon in Georgia

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,250
I'm not going to Frederick Pennsylvania

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm not going to well I would go to

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,620
Hawaii avec la oeil

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm not going to Texas they're coming to

00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:42,930
me if they have a dispute and my

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,970
limitations of diet damages or liability

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:49,180
sir mobility headings I mean these are

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:52,990
all things that I got from my business

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,800
coach plus WP elevation that I put in

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:59,650
and you should always take what you do

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,200
go to a lawyer take what you've already

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,050
written to a lawyer don't go to a lawyer

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,400
and have them draw it up take something

00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,620
that's already written have them tweak

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:15,970
it for you that fits your business model

00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:21,090
and see this is kind of the dashboard of

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:24,220
better proposals you have you have it

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:27,550
outstanding accepted lost I don't really

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,530
deal with the lost part but you they

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,310
have a template marketplace which is

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:35,560
awesome so if you do multiple things

00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:37,420
like SEO and stuff they have a template

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,220
marketplace so you can just bring in any

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,530
kind of tip what they even have the WP

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,880
elevation template in here so you can

00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,240
use that as a starting point

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,100
copyright and consulting marketing it

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,730
gives you a great stop but I like about

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,280
these online systems is every

00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:57,010
I'm the client opens the proposal you

00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,599
get an email to let them know you get to

00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:03,130
see how much time they spend on each

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,560
section so if they only spent 37 seconds

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,290
on the contract part of it you know you

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,380
kind of need to go over that with them

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,960
I've had clients like read and reread

00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,980
and and then the ones that just click

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,349
through and sign and then let's say go

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,670
here and the next steps is where they

00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:26,230
can sign you can option of whether or

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,329
not you take payments online now

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,890
depending on the client I'll ask them do

00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,780
they want to pay online do they want to

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,339
send me a check so if they say they're

00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,320
gonna because they have to do paperwork

00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:38,290
and they have to send a check which is

00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,440
fine I just don't add the payment option

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,240
they sign it online and once I get that

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,740
then I give them their welcome I set up

00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,300
their welcome package send it to them

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:56,140
this is everything I need to start the

00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:59,349
project so let me go back to here now if

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,420
you're just starting out don't get all

00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:06,060
shiny object syndrome and start buying

00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:09,880
stuff okay I have a pdf version of this

00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:12,160
use that and just create PDF versions of

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,170
it until you've got enough reoccurring

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,390
income coming in monthly to pay for the

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,630
tools because you can go broke buying

00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:23,829
all these tools project management I use

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:26,050
Trello it's free but I love better

00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,849
proposals I don't know if I would use it

00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,800
if I had to pay the thirty nine dollars

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:32,020
every month I probably would now because

00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,010
I'm doing very well on the monthly

00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:38,859
income but you know that monthly paying

00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,470
things out don't like doing that so just

00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:43,869
use the PDFs and send it out you may

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,880
even want to split the the proposal out

00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:47,200
from the contract so they assign the

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,510
proposal then you send them to the

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,760
contract to sign the nice thing about a

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,710
PDF is you can put that in the corner

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,319
for them to initial every page that

00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:58,350
they've read it that has that's one of

00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:02,060
the things I've requested for

00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:06,240
proposals that they they do that tools

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:10,020
do it word better proposals there's a

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:14,190
link to that bid sketch is another one

00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,290
proposal 517 hats seventeen hats is kind

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,660
of neat they're pricey but they have

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:22,890
great deals that Black Friday

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,900
Pluto is one I bought on appSumo last

00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:28,200
year or probably even two years ago I'm

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,050
waiting they don't they've got their API

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,460
in beta right now but Pluto is actually

00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:38,670
like Trello and better proposals and a

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,700
CRM all rolled into one

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,680
and but I can't get it to integrate with

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,480
everything so I want something that I

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,670
can do something and send it to Trello

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,950
send it to this send it to that and

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,080
right now they didn't have an API so I'm

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,090
just kind of holding on to that but the

00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,770
API is in beta so they'll probably have

00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:00,120
another appSumo deal coming up in the

00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:03,060
next year guide the client get on the

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,100
phone go over the proposal with them so

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,420
you can answer their questions right

00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,770
right then and there if they have

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,930
anything and then get money before you

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:17,160
do any work you may be excited about the

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:21,780
project but get get the money before you

00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:25,500
do any work now stop stressing about

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,510
proposals if you have any questions I'll

00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,780
be glad to answer them next slide has

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,780
the links to everything any questions

00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:54,619
excellent suggestion I'm so gonna steal

00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,019
that what Dave said is what he does is

00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,180
he records a video of going through the

00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:01,579
proposal includes that of the proposal

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,779
so he doesn't it saves that step of

00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,650
having a phone call and that's an

00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:08,990
excellent idea

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:12,650
you loon use loom comm for recording the

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:24,769
videos I'm gonna like start doing that

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:27,319
this week yes no I paid the fee I'm

00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:31,700
connected to stripe yes it ends up being

00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:34,010
you know 20 30 some dollars but in the

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,440
grand scheme of things for an $8,000

00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,849
website you know now for a twenty three

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,170
thousand dollar website send me a check

00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:50,140
because I really don't want to pay that

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:50,140
two hundred and sons Clerke yep yep

00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:00,470
yeah I need to remove that because I

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,510
stopped doing that and that's like it

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,130
needs to be updated so thanks for

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,069
pointing that out because I didn't catch

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,940
it the last time I went through it any

00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:21,589
other questions

00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:23,660
Dave I have the I have the care plans I

00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:27,619
just say that any additional work is up

00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:35,049
my currently hourly rate which I've told

00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:35,049
them on verbally yeah yes yes

00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:47,630
well eventually you know my prices for

00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,300
care plans will go up but at that point

00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:53,630
it's just like any other client that

00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,010
it's going to increase like you would do

00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:04,220
for any legacy client when you're

00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:07,540
raising prices I don't have a timeline

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,540
but that's a good suggestion

00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,000
okay I'll ask that because I'm going to

00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:27,830
actually take this to the to the lawyer

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,480
here in Georgia cuz that's just kind of

00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,839
left over from Florida when I looked at

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,390
and I haven't been to those but I'll

00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:37,849
make a note of that I'll send you an

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:45,780
email let you know the answer any other

00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:51,030
questions awesome thank you very much

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,030
