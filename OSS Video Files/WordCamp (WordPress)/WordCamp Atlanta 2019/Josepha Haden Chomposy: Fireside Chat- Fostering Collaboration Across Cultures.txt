all right so thank you for joining us my

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,519
name is Jonathan Desrosiers I work at

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,460
Bluehost I am a full-time workers core

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,980
contributor and I'm here to moderate a

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,430
discussion with Josefa Hayden shahbazi

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,630
did you say jump OC okay so that's how

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,730
you say that fancy word that fancy name

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,670
I prefer this mic she prefers to hold

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,810
the mic and that's great so when you

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,160
tell us a little bit about what you do

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,399
day to day yes

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,800
well um I recently became the executive

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,920
director of the WordPress project which

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,430
is most of my day today right now your

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,730
project is gigantic there are like two

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,440
hundred thousand of you and 150 word

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,289
camps a year I don't go to all of them

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,449
although I wish I could but before I

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,160
started doing that what I did a lot of

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,710
and what I still do now is kind of help

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,410
people learn how to communicate better

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,210
and work together better and so I think

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,840
that I'm well suited to the WordPress

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,780
space because of that awesome all right

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,020
so the topic of this discussion is

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,549
fostering collaboration across cultures

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,040
has anybody read the blog post

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,619
anybody for chance a couple people okay

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,409
so we'll kind of get into it a little

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,590
bit what it's about and we are here to

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,890
take your questions as well so you open

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,290
up by describing how brains are our

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,009
prediction machines but they're

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,000
influenced by a lot of things such as

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:37,619
your stereotypes past experiences and

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,659
these things often end up being

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,150
communication barriers especially in a

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,060
global project like WordPress so talk

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,820
about that a little bit specifically

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,259
about stereotypes or about what your

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,670
that our brains are affected by

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,009
different things and yeah how that

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,960
affects how we community people so I

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,119
have found I've worked with a lot of

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,490
large teams and now that I'm working

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,409
with this global project and the teams

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,390
that I work with are also all over the

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,890
the planet I found that that all of the

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,440
experience that we've had with people

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,030
that are like you like everyone I've

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,560
ever met like Sheila and like I have an

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,360
idea of how this con

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,040
it's gonna go regardless of whether I

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,160
want to have that idea or not

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,600
because your brain is constantly

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,760
inundated with information you know and

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,440
so it as a coping mechanism it just

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
pulls together all the information it

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,040
knows about people who look like Birgit

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,840
or who look like angela or or have the

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,660
same experience that i understand of

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
them and just like define what that

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,510
patterns most likely going to be like

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,620
and and yeah I found that those

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,620
stereotypes for the most part are the

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,780
things that cause us to not meet people

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,750
where they are right there those are the

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,390
things that make us decide that we know

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,330
who those people are before we even hear

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,860
about their actual experiences or the

00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,910
struggles that they've had as they've

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,060
gone through the work that they're doing

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,100
with us and with each other and so yeah

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,510
brains are great and also like super

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,370
smart in some ways and super dumb in

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,959
other ways and so stereotypes is the

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,420
super dumb part of your brain it's the

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,550
dumb dumb part yeah get rid of that part

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,319
in case I've never talked to any of you

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,640
about what how I call the regions of the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,720
brain there's the dumb dumb part of the

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,980
brain that just tries to figure out

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,959
whether you're going to be killed or not

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,970
by the person next to you and then the

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,579
smart dumb smart part of the brain that

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,590
works a little slower and is like mhm

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,350
and then the smart smart brain that is

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,090
SuperDuper slow and handles language and

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,829
interactions and communication and stuff

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,329
and it is the last one to get there with

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,370
us all the time so the first thing that

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,260
your brain does is it's like Sheila are

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,930
you with me or against me

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,910
and then later it's like Sheila is not

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,109
gonna hurt you everything's fine I keep

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,359
pointing out people in the audience

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,950
they're like 10 of you and I know many

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:53,760
names we might get to all of you at some

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,519
point just making example well great and

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,390
and that's another part of what makes

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,859
all the different cultures and

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,480
backgrounds of that contribute to

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,190
WordPress great is that everybody has

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,140
different experiences that don't fit

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,739
into these stereotypes so it's important

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,910
to ignore those dumb dumb brain ignore

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,200
your dumb dumb brain but not really

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,519
because it actually does keep you alive

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,739
yes yes stay alive but ignore it so you

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,060
also talk about something called the

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,060
negotiation of meaning and

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,160
basically it's would you mind defining

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,540
that in your words not at all how many

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,360
of you are familiar with the concept of

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,970
the negotiation of meaning wonderful

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,060
love this okay so the negotiation of

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,360
meaning is a basic part of communication

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,460
practices where once you have gathered

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,470
all the information together the two

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,590
people or multiple people who are

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,620
participating in the conversation make

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,770
sure that they understand each other so

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,480
for instance if if I have arrived here

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,610
and I say to you Jonathan we're gonna

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,560
have a fireside chat today and your

00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,670
concept of fireside chat is like we're

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,990
going to go have individual

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,720
conversations with everybody at the

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,790
table but my concept is this we have to

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,800
do that part where it's like okay so

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,450
what is my role what is your role what

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,760
is the objective and just making sure

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,590
that everybody has the same pieces of

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,590
information and the same pieces of

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,790
language to communicate about the

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,700
process or the project that you're

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,410
taking on so that's a very broad concept

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,160
of the negotiation of meaning

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,930
now jargon complicate that things that

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,510
were comfortable saying that not

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,520
everybody understands yeah if any of you

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,860
have ever seen any of my talks about the

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,210
project or community or people or

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,040
working with people so literally

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,110
anything I ever talk about you've heard

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,460
me talk about jargon and how it's a bad

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,740
thing

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,210
even the WordPress project as a whole we

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,060
really try to stay away from jargon

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,130
where we can because for one since we're

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,170
a global project it makes it really hard

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,590
to translate stuff which you wouldn't

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,450
think would be real but it is but these

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,020
simple regular phrases are difficult

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,940
simple regular phrases so our designers

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,910
at the company that I work for I work

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,640
for automatic refer to like minor

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,580
changes and and icons and stuff as

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,990
sprinkles and every time they say that

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,120
to me I'm like I hear you speaking

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,530
English I'm also speaking English but

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,100
you're on a different planet

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:23,180
and so like jargon doesn't even just

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,950
adhere to like we're talking about

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,280
servers and cloud hosting like it's not

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,710
even just that it can be as basic as

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,090
your current definition based on what

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,800
we're talking about is not

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,900
my current definition sprinkles for me

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,060
are always on cupcakes sprinkles for our

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,000
designers are our minor changes that

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,030
make a delightful experience for users

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,350
you know rainbow or chocolate sprinkles

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,419
rainbow all the time Jimmy's we call him

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,130
Jimmy's and no English peas yeah I've

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,580
learned so much about New England by

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,820
West

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,540
hi everybody come visit minutes now so

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,120
when you're working with different

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,300
cultures and different languages that's

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,820
magnified how talked about you were

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,210
talking with me yesterday about colors

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,889
and how colors can are even simple

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,810
colors like we might think white is

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,490
white but another culture

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,720
white might be something different yeah

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,240
talk about that that was really

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,760
interesting more show of hands is anyone

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,490
familiar with the what is it global

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,450
color survey what world color survey

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:31,500
okay couple of people so in the 1970s

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:34,500
there was this survey which it the the

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,060
methodology was heavily flawed so it

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,150
would has been researched in in current

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,570
times but in the 1970s there was this

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,850
research that was done about colors and

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,580
how different cultures name them and how

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,550
they arrived at the names and in general

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,849
there are apparently 11 to 12 different

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,870
motifs where people derive the names for

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:03,750
colors that they have and there was a

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,889
theory and it's harder to track that all

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,080
colors are introduced in languages in

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,510
roughly the same order and that some

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,669
colors are not Universal concepts like

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,190
green blue is not a universal concept

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,979
and and as we were talking about

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,349
yesterday like white depending on your

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,229
concept of what creates a color is

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:27,780
either a subtractive or an additive

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:30,750
process and so even something as basic

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,880
as colors where we feel like you know

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,409
for the most part we understand it but

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,250
that whole thing with colorblindness

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,800
like I I love talking to people with

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,870
with differing abilities from mine about

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,820
their experiences because like I have

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,860
the luxury of the full depth of my

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,769
entire knowledge of being a human

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,300
who exists as I exist and so like when I

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,640
talk to people who are colorblind I'm

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,070
almost like I don't I do not understand

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,860
how like I can't even comprehend how

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,899
that looks and and so having those

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,079
interesting conversations with things

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,269
that seem super real and universal and

00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,120
integrated in our lives is always

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,040
interesting and I think that that's a

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,600
specific and really interesting example

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,060
of that yeah so the example I gave was

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,130
well white is the presence of all colors

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,670
but she said well if you're a painter

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,339
white is the absence of all other colors

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,839
and I've never thought of that because

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,040
he's in technology and so you add all

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,019
the colors together and boom you know

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,300
white but if you had all the colors

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,790
together as an artist you have murky

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:39,029
colors Browns and blacks and yeah yeah

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:40,950
yeah no not nice colors lovely colors so

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,930
another thing that your detail is and

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,390
we'll trade mother's trademark but the

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,970
Joseph's is five five and five four the

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,700
four five and five for fostering

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,959
collaborative culture yeah yeah so I

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,790
didn't actually trademarked the phrase

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,620
five and five but I have been using it

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,310
for 10 years in my presentations it's

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,990
practically yours so let's let's go

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,810
through each one real quick and we'll

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,089
kind of talk about what your your points

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,180
are on each so the first one is team

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,459
tension oh man this is my favorite thing

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,079
so I like to when giving advice to

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,820
people I like to offer my like

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,589
subversive advice that people are gonna

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,100
pretend isn't real

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:22,470
so when we talk about integrating teams

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,940
or working across cultures no matter

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,250
what your culture is defined as like if

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,320
you're talking about America's versus

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,510
Europe or versus Asia that's a type of

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,640
culture but also the example that I use

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,360
in that blog post is our designers

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,339
versus our developers when people are

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,529
talking about how to how to integrate

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,019
teams and make cultures work better

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:46,260
together there's sometimes this idea

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,820
that that means that everyone has to get

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,490
along perfectly and everything should be

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,430
fine and everyone needs to agree and I

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,410
don't think that's true I think that if

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,910
everyone agreed on everything all of the

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,670
time then diversity wouldn't be an

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,060
important thing that we have to work on

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,710
and when we find people who are visually

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,990
diverse from us but have the exact same

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,700
life experiences I think that we run

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,890
into the same problems as we would have

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,380
run into if we had all of the same

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,410
looking people you know and so my

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,750
subversive piece of advice is that

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:22,560
anytime that you want a diverse group

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,390
and interesting perspective perspectives

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,890
on things you have to be prepared to

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:30,030
have some tension and I don't think that

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:32,610
that's a bad thing I just was in so I'm

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,650
a singer and I was just in a rehearsal

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,580
on Monday where our conductor was like I

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,290
don't want to say tension because

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,540
tension is a bad word

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,050
and the thing that I say in that blog

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,840
post is it doesn't matter like tension

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,800
is needed if you're going to have

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,100
diversity it's just that you have to

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,850
find a way to take that and make it into

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,470
jazz as opposed to discordant noise that

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,990
resonates forward pressors because we

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,090
super love jazz if I ever find something

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,680
where I can like make a quotable nugget

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,050
about barbecue you all will be the first

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,700
to know but until then you have me with

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,700
jazz hopefully it comes with samples

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,920
music is is actually a very common

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,940
background for developers and designers

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,450
I find a lot of musicians and

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,370
WordPress's

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,190
yeah we do this I think it's similar

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,020
there's a lot of structure to both and

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,940
there's different methodologies and it

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,320
kind of translates well I'm gonna tell

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,000
you another subversive thing you'll get

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,970
to today most of the time people just

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,240
get one I think that development is a

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,780
creative process languages so science

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,310
and math and music I think is all in the

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,750
same basic part of the brain it's been

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,920
the language and processing part of the

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,410
brain because all of these things are

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,720
semantic like it's all trying to say

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,450
something but putting something together

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,340
in a in a particular language so that it

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,600
communicates the end product whatever

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,580
that end product might have infinite

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,590
possibilities with it yeah yeah so when

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,690
I hear that people like oh I'm a

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,640
musician I can't be in technology like I

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,650
don't agree with them at all Matt

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,450
Mullenweg the founder of the co-founder

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,950
of WordPress is a musician I'm a

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,780
musician we're just that wandering

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,310
around doing these things I think it's

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,070
totally normal to have a music

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,240
background here

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,990
yes okay the next one was respect and

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,310
accountability

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:23,500
oh so this this is for this was from the

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,199
team lead section you have to treat

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,660
others with respect but it hold yourself

00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,149
personally accountable I think it

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,949
totally makes sense to say retreat

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,620
others with respect but that other part

00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:38,110
for leaders sometimes is really hard I

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,029
don't believe in the concept of being

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,410
vulnerable for vulnerabilities sake but

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,420
I do believe that all of our leaders

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,630
should be vulnerable especially when it

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,459
comes to hey Micah I said this thing

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,990
that I assumed about you and I was wrong

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm really sorry about that I'll do

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,040
better in the future

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,720
like that's it if you identify that

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,089
you're because we're human beings and we

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,600
can't be perfect but I think that the

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:04,060
only way that leaders can can move

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,709
through that and create a sense of

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,380
belonging and safety with the people

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,399
that they're working with is to say I

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,410
offended you and I didn't realize it and

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,279
I'm sorry I'll do better and I don't

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,690
think there's anything wrong with

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,029
holding yourself personally accountable

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,779
for those things so I didn't offend

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:22,779
Micah he's I don't think no he's just

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,010
okay he didn't get up and leave so

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,010
that's good not today

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,190
the next one was having a North Star

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,360
what do you mean by that

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:36,160
yeah I talk about this a lot so for many

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,680
of you who did not know that I currently

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,269
am the executive director of things you

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,560
probably did not read my leadership post

00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,510
because it totally didn't matter to you

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,870
it was just like random news anyway okay

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,560
great but I talked about it there and I

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,399
talked about it in the last thing that I

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,740
did in London

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:58,029
so it comes up for me a lot and I think

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,060
it's important um I really feel like if

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,760
we don't know where we share our common

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,050
understanding understandings of things

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,819
for instance in the middle of

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,880
negotiation of meaning and you don't say

00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:10,930
and that's our end goal and here's why

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,149
what you end up doing is just like

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,060
micromanaging people all the way to some

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,649
unknown destination and you get tired

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,889
and fatigued and they get tired and

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,230
fatigued and like small iterative cycles

00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,540
like that makes sense in some spaces but

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,910
I think and anyone who's worked with me

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,280
close

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,740
knows but I'm always like that is our

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,990
end goal this is the general story arc

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,520
of how we're gonna get there as long as

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,230
you're kind of going that way

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,580
like I mostly don't care how you get

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,750
there except for like there's this thing

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,910
that's super wrong don't do that

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,680
everything else like figure it out that

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,740
way and I think that's really important

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,810
otherwise people don't know how to row

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,460
together and where they're rowing to I'm

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:54,140
just gonna use a lot of metaphors in

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:56,360
here let me kind of talk about this a

00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,830
little bit but jargon free is the way to

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:06,470
be where anything's adds that no okay

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:08,380
yes I do just it's just there are there

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,640
are things that when you speak

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,070
specifically in jargon you're trying to

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,290
accomplish one of the things that you

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,450
try to accomplish is to prove how much

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,790
smarter you are than other people and I

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,900
when I was a teenager definitely wanted

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,600
to be the smartest person in the room

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,300
all the time and thankfully I stopped

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,490
that because like it's great to be the

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,500
smartest person in the room I guess but

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,420
like if you're the smartest know-it-all

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,620
person and no one understands you and no

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,420
one wants to work with you then it

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,680
doesn't matter what you can do because

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,250
no one will do it with you

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,480
you know I learned from ya and it's more

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,550
of that meeting people where they are

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,900
like there's no point in trying to prove

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,340
that you're smarter than everybody and

00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,990
there's also no point in trying to

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,170
distance yourself and make it clear that

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,390
there's an us-versus-them like it's

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,520
really easy to get into into camps

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,650
because all people want to know that

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,960
they fit somewhere right we want to know

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,090
that we belong yeah and so that us

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,430
versus them a little bit turns into like

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,680
this is my us and I don't care who that

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,650
them is like this is my us and just

00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,570
making it super clear that you don't

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,400
want other people to belong with you

00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,080
doesn't make any sense to me and so

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,270
that's why I always fight for no jargon

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,100
and word breath space and I know that

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,750
people really want it and you know some

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,260
things we have to and so we're working

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,550
on a glossary for the wordpress.org site

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,780
so that everyone will know what we're

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,630
talking about all the time and I'm so

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,320
excited I love it

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:36,650
and then the last one proximity aides

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,130
familiarity yes how many of you are

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:42,880
familiar with the meme of the

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,250
a long shirt great another teach you

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,280
today so there's this meme out there or

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,860
these two children are there they're put

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,120
in a one giant shirt because they've

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
been fighting and so their parents

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,480
method for getting them to stop fighting

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,680
is to put them in one big shirt and they

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,410
have to cooperate on everything for the

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,670
whole day and it says get along on it so

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,380
that's that's terrible

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,170
don't recommend that to any I don't

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,590
recommend that to parents probably you

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,510
can find a nicer way to do it but I have

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,030
found over the course of my career

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,920
leading people and and helping to mentor

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,440
leaders that when you have people who

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,830
are saying I don't like working with

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,550
this person I don't like working with

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,850
designers I don't like working with

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,940
developers we don't get better at that

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,580
by just like wishing for it to change

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,590
like we all are people and we have to

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,300
practice those things and so I have

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,830
found the best way to get people to like

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,450
figure out that they actually don't hate

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,650
each other's be like hey I know you

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,690
don't quite get along but there's this

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,090
really important project and you unite

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,050
them around the process and around the

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,330
project and convince them to kind of put

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,690
their egos aside for a second and do

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:59,200
something that that is productive toward

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,120
the same space and I with some notable

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,950
exceptions found that that was really

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,270
helpful for them for me too the notable

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,730
exceptions were definitely not in

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,990
WordPress it's all fine okay

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,420
those are all the notes I had from

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:17,170
reading your blog post fantastic what

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,920
else would you like to add well um so we

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,340
want to get to everybody's questions

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,710
yeah I think we could open it up for

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,740
some questions I I know we're not

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,390
live-streaming but if you all want to

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,940
share with Twitter that people can share

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,800
their questions and I have a colleague

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,080
down here to help us get them from

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,680
Twitter in case they show up you can of

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,960
course tweet with the hashtag WC ATL but

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,060
also the hashtag sassy pickle so that we

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,130
can find you / I can find you later to

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,560
answer the questions on Twitter except I

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,330
was told yesterday that I didn't answer

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,770
one from Miami and I have to go back and

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,270
answer that totally gonna do it you

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,900
might have to find her in six months and

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,260
tell her it's

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,890
yeah Miami was like three months ago

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,390
okay

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:03,820
sassy pickle yes well let's take some

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,840
questions about about leader not

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,690
leadership what are we talking about

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,100
fostering mustering collaboration and

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:53,650
then I'll tell you about why I'm a sassy

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:55,660
pickle so is any questions okay I'll

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,080
explain both those things first off five

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,550
and five refers to just a structure of

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,520
my presentations that I give where I

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,410
give five pieces of advice on one side

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,180
of a coin and five pieces of advice on

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,620
another side of the coin and so the

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,330
sides of the coin in this case were

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,950
people who are leading from the front

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,950
versus people who are leading from

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,830
within and so that's all that that was

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,770
about so it's not like a product it's

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,410
just the thing I say so the question the

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,150
other question was about that first

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,520
piece of advice that I gave to leaders

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,610
where you have to expect some tension in

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,190
teams where you're where you're

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,870
fostering collaboration I wanted to call

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,660
to everyone's attention this fantastic

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:42,720
resource called the cultural atlas and

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:47,230
the URL is cultural atlas SBS comm a you

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,880
it was pulled together by SBS which is

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,470
an Australian basically public

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,380
broadcasting system like we have here

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,330
and it specifically is geared toward

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,980
their primary migrant cultures and they

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,350
did a lot of excellent research and it's

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,970
a kind of a living resource for them but

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,250
yeah so especially when you're working

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,330
in a global space and you have

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:13,720
all of these cultures the difficulty is

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:16,420
that we hardly know where those cross

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,360
cultures cross-cultural connections are

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,640
happening because at this point with

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,490
WordPress for sure but probably with

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,550
your group also like every collection of

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,160
my of majorities that you have is made

00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:35,730
up in any number of minority groups

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,730
right and so finding a way to

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,660
respectfully get people to give you the

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,180
information that you need is really

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,820
important finding out like if I'm

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,770
working with a primarily Dutch company

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,810
what is the best way for me to manage

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,600
the overall negotiation process and

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:56,320
their methods of communication and and

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,650
like how how funny you're allowed to be

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,420
or whatever it is and and doing your

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,450
best to meet people where they are it

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,950
doesn't work as far as like expect some

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,080
tension to just be like everyone get in

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,880
there and hope it all works out like

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,130
you've got to do some of the advance

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,900
work as a leader to say hey it sounds

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,750
like we have some miscommunication here

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,520
when you said this thing is this what

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,530
you meant over there and then you have

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,020
to facilitate that negotiation of

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,430
meaning sections sometimes it would be

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,730
wonderful if the negotiation of meaning

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,200
meeting meaning happened at the

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,340
beginning of things and lasted forever

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,860
but it's kind of a cycle you negotiate

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,540
the meaning and then you discover that

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,190
there's this new cross-cultural space

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,930
and then you have to negotiate some more

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,880
meaning in there just kind of over and

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:49,060
over as a cycle does that answer the

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,950
question of it yeah all right we had a

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,840
mic coming around I think we lost it I

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,510
am the mic we'll just try to repeat it

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,100
question for the for the people on the

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,210
video and I'll repeat it for the video

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,210
getting a thumbs-up

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:08,330
as a business trainer myself this

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:13,750
presentation was excellent vision we did

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,750
it so thank you

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:28,280
one of the things that I do when I've

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:32,350
started a new group developing mentors

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:36,380
to work with newbies I make the mentors

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:38,990
do an exercise in listening skill yes

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,630
and so they sit with chairs back-to-back

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,880
so they're facing opposite directions

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,920
and I give them interesting characters I

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,340
find online and when you are I used

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,970
Arabic letters because Americans don't

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,160
know Arabic letters and one person has

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,900
to describe it the other person has to

00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:04,280
draw it up and then the exercise is

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:08,190
reversed so they get both sides and then

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:11,970
that was and now what they said was not

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,520
translated into the dry heat and so I

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,580
think that the conversation about

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,890
starting an early is really part of my

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,409
commitment to doing that right from the

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:25,140
get-go you know that when the team comes

00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:27,900
together exercises like that could be a

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,950
great way for saying we've got to find

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,630
the common ground

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:35,070
we've got to use language that we all

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:42,000
agree to so I just think that today is

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:43,590
really priceless I'll put it in

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,990
recording this was a lovely compliment

00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:51,390
it's all up there I'm not very good at

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:56,010
pictionary for the record John Gorrie

00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:00,090
yeah getting people to guess it so so

00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:03,750
this was this was kind of a kind of

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,789
talking about team team connections and

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:09,450
team-building exercises a little bit

00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:13,530
yeah an interesting thing that I noticed

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:16,440
recently about team building I think by

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,919
the way that as as a collective group of

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,470
human beings we are about to move into a

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,630
newer more modern concept of leadership

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,490
that is not about like scare everyone

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,830
and hope they do what you need them to

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,080
do like them that's we're past that now

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,299
and I'm glad of it because I remember in

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,280
my first number of team-building

00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,320
experience as I ever had it basically

00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,539
was like put them in a dire situation so

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,289
they feel bonded by the fear like why

00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,640
would you do that

00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,880
they're like put them in a giant tree

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,240
and make them zipline down like that was

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,130
how we did team-building and hearing

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,929
about this exercise this was a listening

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:56,880
exercise for anyone who did not hear

00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:59,159
where you give to a pair one of them

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,059
describes in this case an Arabic

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,039
alphabet character and the other one has

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:06,690
to draw it and then they switch so that

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,760
everyone kind of has that shared

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,799
experience of we don't all communicate

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,360
the same way and we don't all visualize

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,370
things the same way

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,350
yeah absolutely I love hearing new

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,000
team-building exercises that are based

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,440
on like uncovering our basic

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,120
understandings as human beings as

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,400
opposed to our basic understandings as

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,580
things that want to not die in our

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,230
dum-dum brains yeah see it was really

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,640
useful I told him about my dum-dum brain

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,970
smart smart brain knew it would come in

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,929
handy

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:36,679
mm-hmm anybody else any other questions

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:36,679
yes

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,860
that is a fantastic question the

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,420
question is if you're getting to know

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,030
someone from a new culture what are like

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,680
the top three things you can ask to make

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,600
sure that you get to know them better in

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,340
a in an office setting you know working

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,530
together setting I think that the things

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:05,390
that are important in my mind to know

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:09,200
are one like how literal are you going

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:12,290
to take things how how much can I use

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,080
humor to soften the blow how direct do I

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,430
have to be or can I be the other thing

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:23,510
that I think is always important to know

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:25,370
is whether whether hmm whether they

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,650
primarily want the relationship to be

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,180
transactional or if they do want to have

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,030
the opportunity to get to know you as a

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,530
person there are varying scales of that

00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:38,000
like workspaces are by nature

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,820
transactional but if you're working in

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,650
distributed spaces like I do and like

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,880
most WordPress volunteers do at least

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,370
when they're volunteering you have to

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,750
know like do you want me to have small

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,440
talk before I have conversations with

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:55,580
you and then generally asking people how

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,500
they how they best take direction for

00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,120
themselves like they will know whether

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,320
it's best if you write it down ahead of

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,420
time and give it to them and then they

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,770
can ask questions or if you can just

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,450
show up to the meeting and be like hey

00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:08,300
I've got this new task here all the

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,710
things so they can ask questions then so

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,980
just asking them how they need the

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:17,480
information there is this thing that I

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:20,270
use with my teams it's called I call it

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,100
personal operating manual and so

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,300
everyone on my team and I don't I don't

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,330
have these anymore because I don't have

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,000
lots of direct reports like this now but

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,100
when I had when I was managing teams

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,250
every person had their own notebook

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,410
where I wrote down like what motivated

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,000
them and how they preferred to get

00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,590
information and how they preferred to

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,240
participate in meetings and if they

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,220
needed things ahead of time so that they

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,710
had time to like think through it and

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,930
research it and so like I knew for each

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,770
of my team my team members what it was

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:55,220
that that made them want to continue to

00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,680
come to work and how I could meet them

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,570
where they were as far as how they

00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,580
needed to be communicated with and how

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,620
they needed to take feedback and how I

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,090
could best set them up for personal

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,140
success with the work that I was asking

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,700
them to do so

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,800
personal operating manual that is a

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,860
thing that is is Google able everyone

00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,060
knows about it but I loved it so some of

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,370
those things are things you might have

00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,810
to find out through working with someone

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,220
you might not be able to directly say

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,410
how direct do you want me to be right

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,030
but you might have to experiment a

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,620
little bit and what's the best way for

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,840
you to figure that out for people

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,840
yeah for sure good point yeah

00:30:30,659 --> 00:31:01,830
I finally go to the embassy yes same

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,359
this this was a follow-on comment to a

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,239
couple of the last questions we had

00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,009
which was saying go to the resources

00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,720
that exist the consulate for the country

00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:22,019
if you're going to be doing a lot of

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:25,849
work in that space and foreign Chambers

00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,849
of Commerce yes excellent

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:41,370
Chinese professionals okay president of

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,500
inventors Association and they're

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:48,470
looking for people who want to do

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:51,330
business in China and you know so

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,940
they're going to have to get prepared if

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,260
they are an American person and now

00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,080
they're going to be interviewed by a

00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:13,220
panel of Chinese professionals to see

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:16,940
whether or not they qualify who we

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,940
forget we're back on the back

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:39,180
you say Kolby Kol be e-assessment

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,180
[Music]

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,660
yeah

00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,110
yeah yeah

00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:04,140
here's a print assessment is it what was

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:06,420
the second one a print assessment we

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,250
have about 15 minutes left that was that

00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:12,630
was a note that you can add additional

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,400
testing into your hiring process with

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,230
the Kolbe something and the print

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,600
assessment rating yeah to the personal

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,080
operating manual I think we have time

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,080
for one more

00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,499
[Music]

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,479
[Music]

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,949
[Music]

00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:43,490
okay so so I wish I had a clear answer

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,640
the question is how do you navigate how

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:49,520
do you navigate situations where the

00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,530
expectation around what you have done

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,400
are different so in this example it was

00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,590
a decision forever versus like I think

00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,440
this is the decision I think we should

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:03,590
explore this as our option like how how

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,240
concrete something is I wish I had an

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:09,080
answer for like how you manage it

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,180
because that would be excellent but I've

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,250
not actually explored how I got to the

00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:16,540
point where I am with that so I've been

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:20,810
working with global teams for gosh

00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:25,700
almost a decade now I don't feel old you

00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:27,230
feel and and I know that when I started

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,450
doing that I ran into problems like that

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,100
all the time where I would say something

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,740
confidently cuz like confidence is a

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,540
thing we value in America and the

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,400
confidence came across as oh well I

00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,600
guess we're doing that from this person

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,430
who's definitely not in a

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,350
decision-making capacity you know and

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,660
people would do things because I'd been

00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:47,210
so confident and then I was like ah no I

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,780
can't make final choices don't do that I

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:53,630
have learned over time how to manage

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,390
that better but I don't know if it's so

00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:00,170
much like this is how I learned how to

00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:05,300
do it as as much as it was at some point

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:08,630
I learned that the voice that I have is

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,720
not inconsequential and it hasn't been

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,310
in some inconsequential for a long time

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,690
and so learning to be more careful with

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:20,330
the way that I manage discussions and

00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:23,030
the way that I contextualize like this

00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,450
is something that I'm interested in

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,550
discuss

00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,010
saying I don't have the all the answers

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:31,220
yet help me figure out where I could be

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:33,830
wrong about it like learning to be aware

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:37,040
of the fact that that with a big voice

00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:39,980
comes to sound trite big

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,990
responsibilities you know like we have a

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,850
number of people in the WordPress

00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,880
community across our entire ecosystem

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,670
who are who people look to as like

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,680
trendsetters and sometimes when they are

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,690
not aware of that like they can make

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,910
offhanded remarks about something that's

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,130
happening or not happening and change

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:03,200
the course of an entire career on

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:07,970
accident and so I learned that in a

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:10,520
really not as as high-stakes space as as

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,750
the work that I do now and I'm glad that

00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,330
I did because I think that a lot of

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,400
people don't have the luxury of like the

00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,930
only error that I made was to make

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,960
someone make a set of charts that took

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:23,120
them 10 hours and now I feel like a jerk

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,090
that that was the biggest extent of of

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,910
my errors that helped me learn that but

00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:31,130
like if I think about had I tried to do

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,020
that learning from this stage you know

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,990
from this stage in my career like how

00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:39,050
awful I could have have made some

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,390
people's lives it's it's humbling and

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,610
also uh sometimes terrifying but I don't

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,950
have a quick answer other than like go

00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:49,460
make some non-consequential mistakes

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:51,470
which is not useful advice you kind of

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,930
see that a lot in workers corps to know

00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,690
I do when a ticket might get open and

00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:58,130
then I my brain dump into the ticket but

00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,080
someone will take it as direction and

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,030
then three hours later there's a patch

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,560
and it's a big patch you know like oh

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,200
wait we still have to think about things

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,030
before we write code so it's even a

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,460
problem with that it's very hard to

00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:13,010
communicate motion in text and in tennis

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,260
yeah and you'll notice that in in any

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:17,810
post that I put up where it's not a

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,090
final decision like I put it in the

00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,680
title I'm like discussion the first

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,540
thing so that's what comes up in

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,220
people's RSS feeds it comes up in their

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,540
emails it comes up as they're reading it

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,730
unless they don't read the title which

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,550
that's true for some people and I can't

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,620
make them people don't read the post but

00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,590
they still comment also that also that

00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,060
yeah contextualizing what you expect out

00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,300
of the car

00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,970
Station it feels cumbersome when you

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,070
start doing it it feels uncomfortable

00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:47,110
but I think it's really valuable to

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,760
avoid you know exactly things like that

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:57,000
people are like well Jonathan said it so

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:57,000
now we must do we have time for a quick

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,890
[Music]

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,660
okay so here we'll wrap up and we'll

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,550
Jonathan and I will be out there and you

00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,020
all can come and ask us additional

00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,450
questions thank you so much for having

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,450
