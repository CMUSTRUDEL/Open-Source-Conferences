Title: Alda VigdÃ­s: Make your Gutenberg blocks accessible
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Vienna 2019
Description: 
	Web accessibility can be tricky, especially as the main focus of many WordPress developers right now is to get into learning Gutenberg and React.
The heated discourse around the new WordPress editor during its release has been heavily concentrated on accessibility, underlining how important it is not to regress, even when new technologies are settling in.
Make your blocks more accessible and learn how to use correct semantic markup, use ARIA tags to tame it and get a crash course in accessibility as a term that encompasses best practices, inclusivity, regulation and SEO.

okay so I don't see many people moving

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,070
outside we are almost ready to start

00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:21,020
first I just want to mention a couple of

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,480
things that I didn't mention yet we have

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,189
a code of conduct it's available on our

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,840
website and I would like to ask all of

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,509
you to follow it if you're not a mirror

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,930
with it please open the website and take

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,860
at least a quick look if you see anybody

00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,410
causing kletzing any trouble please

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,570
report to somebody with the red shirts

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,190
like mine we're going to contact them

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,840
quietly also after this talk we're going

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,460
to give a short coffee break which is

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,039
going to happen in the lobby where you

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,920
have all the sponsors and there you can

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,570
also find some toilets if you have any

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,510
questions please don't hesitate to ask

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,839
me and without much further ado our next

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,390
speaker comes right now from Germany

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:05,120
she's going to talk about Guttenberg and

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,570
accessibility because right now she's a

00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,370
colleague of mine at automatic at the

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,890
moment she's working around integrating

00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,630
Guttenberg with jetpack but she's also

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,280
done a lot of accessibility work on the

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,050
new editor so I think the next talk is

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:30,080
going to be very interesting please

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:32,930
welcome all them yes so essentially yeah

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,500
I titled this make your Guttenberg box

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:39,710
accessible and also a possibility 101

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,460
sort of on inside brackets because it's

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,830
mostly about that so my name is Alta

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,050
weak this scarf appeared in storage and

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,270
for anybody who has like trouble

00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,120
pronouncing that name or like asks me

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,760
like how is it pronounced or what does

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,710
it mean like this is like the meaning of

00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,860
the name you don't call me that by the

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,520
way but you know this is usually you

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,330
know forgers that you know so pronouns

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,720
see her and I work as a coat Wrangler

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,550
act automatic you can find - alt

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,930
evictees on most social media so if you

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,870
want to give me feedback after the talk

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:22,200
then you know I'm on Twitter and my blog

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:28,340
is alt evictees dot wordpress.com

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,230
yeah so my first programming language

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,780
that I used for real aside from like

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,590
basic and loco and stuff like that in

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,830
school was PHP and I made a massive

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,370
social social network for my school with

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,280
all the security faults and terrible

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,990
injections that you can find back in

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:56,010
2002 and my first wordpress projects

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,440
were like way way back like 2005 2004

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:03,690
made a website for a music festival and

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,850
and as it became more useful I have had

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,430
started switching from through Paul and

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:15,990
other CMS's into WordPress especially as

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:18,540
custom post types came to be and like

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,030
you know way back you know we had to

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,970
hack the course to get things working

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:29,190
there were no plugins and and all sorts

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:31,320
of fun things and yes sort of six or

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,700
seven years ago switched or to Rails for

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,910
the most part mainly peak has not that I

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,470
didn't like WordPress anymore but I was

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,950
starting to feel arc WordPress work

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:47,100
especially good front-end services were

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,250
getting undervalued over time and I was

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,770
starting to get more auditing and

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,190
cleanup projects that I was sort of

00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,500
hoping for I was not the designers were

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,710
coming to me with masa master

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,210
HTML and markup and asking me to fix

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,750
them instead of working it from scratch

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,200
which costs the same pathway and now I'm

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,720
working full-time at automatic and my

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,230
test and trial projects at automatic

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,390
took on usually a long time so even if I

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,020
pen only working for automatic for the

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,880
past seven months or so I have been

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,610
involved with a company in one way or

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,460
another for about a year and a half

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,190
including everything

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,990
and like if anybody wants to get some

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,030
details about you know working in the

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,069
public sector or the United Nations or

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,229
at automatic land feel free to like hit

00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:47,960
me up after the talk and we can have a

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:49,580
conversation so these are yeah so my in

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,440
the past I've contributed to the

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,330
WordPress core and the I like the

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,020
Atlantic translation which has

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,729
unfortunately stagnated and I'm

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,550
currently on the working group for the

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:06,889
trans flag emoji proposal to the Unicode

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:09,259
consortium it's fun sort of zero which

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,680
during a combination it's a fun an

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,080
exciting project but if you want to get

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,830
to know like strange politics get the

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,440
silent treatment for 14 months general

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,560
ignorance then I really recommend doing

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,539
some work for Unicode it's it's a yeah

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,009
it's very interesting yeah so one of the

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,289
steps towards working full-time with

00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,419
automatic was a trial project that was

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,729
supposed to take about a month you know

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,009
they saw my resume hey you have you're

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:43,370
interested in accessibility like hey

00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:45,849
come work on the Gutenberg editor people

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,590
are complaining about accessibility and

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:51,259
yeah there was a lot of controversy

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,650
regarding accessibility and a new perk

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,289
editor and yeah and I ended up working

00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,830
on a trainee thing there for three

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:03,830
months and just to spend some time I

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,050
started expanding into other things so

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,280
the project was about fixing

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,310
accessibility issues in the publishing

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,080
workflow especially regarding replacing

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,300
the tape maker with something more

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,190
accessible and like adapting it to the

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:21,320
science and and the work Club and to be

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,440
frank like I switched over to the

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,270
community site very quickly like and

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,300
that's really where most of the work was

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,050
going on if it would not have been for

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,789
the WordPress accessibility group

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,909
especially people like Andrea fraca and

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:40,460
Ryan Reed wealth and all the valuable

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,450
input from the rest of the accessibility

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,150
group

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,050
I would not be here today that's that's

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,050
absolutely for sure

00:06:47,530 --> 00:07:00,220
so my most significant work at automatic

00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:02,960
has been Gutenberg integration in Jack

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,030
it's a project that we called wooden

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,660
pack internally and we started working

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,710
on it

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,630
very close to the release of Gutenberg

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,460
so for anybody out there who thinks that

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,580
you know we had all the advance

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,070
knowledge or that Gutenberg is only like

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,650
made to I mean I've heard these

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,890
conspiracy theories about Gutenberg

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:28,790
being like a way for automatic to be

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:33,680
ahead of the competition well we were

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:38,540
like just as frustrated and confused as

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,360
everybody else in essence we have been

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:46,190
developing poor based on many other

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,750
shortcuts that we have and and I decided

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,820
at least for the stuff that I was

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,600
working on for example the related posts

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,910
block to improve the marker and make

00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,920
things a bit more accessible without

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:03,800
trying to break things and in our case

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:11,090
the word clue is somewhat different than

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:14,090
for like classic wp-admin work as the ad

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,270
pack is extremely monolithic and the

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:21,250
workflow starts with calypso so we start

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:27,110
by making the admin side for calypso

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:30,490
with a JavaScript interface and then and

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,330
calypso as some should know is the

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:37,490
administrative interface we use on

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:42,290
wordpress.com and then we ported the

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:46,280
Gutenberg functionality over to WP admin

00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:50,720
and and at the same time all the pack

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,820
and rendered blocks were made with WP

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,860
admin in mind the whole time so it's

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,640
yeah so

00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:03,230
working with the monolith is can be a

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,600
bit complicated and but I've but I've

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,670
tried my best to sort of make that

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,110
experience applied to others so

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,970
essentially my gutenberg experience

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,850
comes from working on gutenberg

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:23,480
components as in the publishing workflow

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:26,030
and my work on chat so as this is a

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,420
world cam talk and not just a you know

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:31,250
short flash talk at at the local

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,380
WordPress media of where i can assume

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,540
everybody is like extremely

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,850
knowledgeable about WordPress and you

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,530
know app development in general I'm

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,040
expecting people with wide range of

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:47,090
skills to be here and no let's etcetera

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,250
and Scouten perky introduced new

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,210
accessibility challenges to say the

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,150
least

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,300
by replacing the classic editor that was

00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:00,890
based on you know more than a packet or

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,440
work an improvement over time so many of

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,260
us are faced with project management

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,990
prioritization especially if we work at

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,090
agencies and we need to be able to

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,300
justify accessibility work to our

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,280
co-workers and our clients so this is

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,800
not only going to be a technical talk

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,900
about how to make it blocks accessible

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:28,280
and I will concentrate largely on device

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:31,190
and then I would go into the house the

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,410
first part where I go into the basics of

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,230
accessibility is more extensive than I

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,380
originally intended and it's going to be

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,950
the particular talk to be honest and it

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,150
was written from the perspective of

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:48,530
consultancy projects and website

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:51,140
building in general so yeah I'm going to

00:10:48,530 --> 00:11:01,910
start with what I had chapter that I

00:10:51,140 --> 00:11:04,130
call web accessibility 101 so web back

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,400
working on accessibility work is the

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:12,590
practice of making websites work

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:15,250
for people who have a disability people

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:19,010
who can't use a browser in a regular way

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:23,120
people who have mobility vision hearing

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,550
company and cognitive impairments you

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,580
know have epilepsy which might be

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:34,100
photosensitive for instance have motor

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:37,150
and dexterity impairments so the common

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,780
perception here is that we make websites

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,820
accessible and that accessibility work

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,860
is for those who are blind or deaf

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,650
mostly but the fact of the matter is

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,630
that there is a much larger group that

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,570
has a long term disability or mobility

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,950
issues that you know most of us realize

00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:01,220
and it's very common that we just think

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,020
we if you're doing any sort of actions

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,240
will be work or accessibility audits

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:10,450
that we know go or things with a screen

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:13,580
reader and if it works then it works so

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,500
just to give a list of like some

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,530
accessibility technologies that we have

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,770
to account for screen magnifiers that

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:25,130
essentially you know programs that zoom

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,980
in where the mouse pointer is or any

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:32,450
other location on the screen so the user

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:36,500
can see an expanded image of what they

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:40,000
are supposed to be looking at so this is

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,730
used for instance by people who have

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,020
hard time seeing screen readers as well

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:51,380
they commonly used by the legally blind

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,530
jaws used to be common screen reader on

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,290
Windows and voiceover comes with your

00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:01,040
Mac so you can run it in Safari quite

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:05,300
easily and use you know tapping and it

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,250
will read for you what you see and there

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,940
is one thing that I find really cool and

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:14,150
that's reef refreshable Braille displays

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,180
so it's instead of having a Braille

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,540
printer which is like a pop-up printer

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,540
somehow

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,360
those are mainly used by those who are

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:30,510
deafblind to throughout both Poland and

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:34,089
death and yeah they use touch to

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:38,560
interact with with their computers and

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:43,240
their and websites mouth operated

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:48,370
devices for those who have mobility

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,080
issues below knack for instance this is

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,880
a common device like it's like a

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,580
joystick that you operate with your

00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,190
mouse essentially or you blow into a

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:05,160
tube to click etc etc and keyboard

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:09,480
navigation essentially a lot of

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:15,029
accessibility work just goes into making

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,779
websites accessible using the keyboard I

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:19,959
had an accident

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:24,130
two years ago where I lost my mouse arm

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:27,010
and it was the I ended up just having to

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:32,170
tap through a lot of sites and got to

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:37,000
know that feeling of or not being able

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:40,570
to you know use websites in many cases

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,899
or games even that in a way that was

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:47,829
originally intended by the way if you

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:50,020
want to see something this is this is a

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:53,950
Braille display so the you to

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,660
essentially touches the surface to read

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,660
what's going right or interact with

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,670
what's going on if you know about or if

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,420
you own or if you've seen one of these

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,450
things I have never seen one in person

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:12,610
even if I'm following guidelines to work

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:15,010
with these things so actually being able

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,649
to test one of these Braille displays

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,870
would be an absolutely amazing

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,560
experience for me

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,389
[Music]

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,240
and yeah there are things we need to

00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:29,899
consider other than just navigation and

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,410
different kinds of disabilities and for

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,420
example color contrast between text and

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,999
Packer tunnel elements and this is

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,879
something you can spot directly when

00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:44,329
your agency designer comes in and gives

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,910
you that you know one two gigabyte two

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,819
photos your file and says please make a

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,769
website out of this you can generally

00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:54,199
support called contrast issues or

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:55,730
potential color contrast issues let's

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,040
say you have image sliders with like

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:04,600
text on top you can usually see

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:07,579
potential contrast issues there and

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,670
there are things like user response

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:15,769
times time sensitive user interfaces

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:20,149
like typing in a two-factor

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:24,259
authentication codes session timing you

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,670
don't want the user session let's say

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,029
you're changing your passport or

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,220
passport passport or whatever and you

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,829
don't want that session to expire in

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,290
just a couple of minutes because those

00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:39,410
with mobility issues may take a much

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:42,410
longer time to type in or enter

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:47,470
information find the profile image or

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:52,910
whatever then most of us who are not

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:59,420
disabled also accessibility guidelines

00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:01,879
like we CAC indicate guidelines about

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:06,559
closed captioning and subtitles were

00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:08,929
with you and they specify that the

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,870
closed captioning should be on live meet

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:16,130
you as well to include accessibility for

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,470
the Deaf the problem here is yes there

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,589
is technology for that in English and

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:26,360
most sort of dominating languages German

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:30,460
Japanese etc but for a small language

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,350
area like from my country of origin

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,450
300,000 Icelandic speakers you know it

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,350
would not make sense to do it so

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,410
in the regulatory implementation of the

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,350
EU access web accessibility directive

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:50,450
this has been sort of quietly dropped

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,490
out in regards to live video and just to

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,220
give you some numbers I looked this up

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,420
last night and you know I'm not giving

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,870
any source but it's mainly like

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:04,430
government websites that indicate these

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:10,040
things so w80 says that there are 1.3

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:12,910
billion people with disability worldwide

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,650
or serve disabilities

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:19,430
this could be mental disorders this

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:21,590
could be weights yeah do you need to

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:27,050
account for in web accessibility as well

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:32,120
athd for instance and mobility issues

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:35,630
etc etc the German numbers indicate ten

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:39,250
point three million with if you include

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:43,760
both temporary and permanent disability

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:46,670
7.5 million who are deemed seriously

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,590
disabled according to the German

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:55,400
government here in Austria there was

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:58,190
palmate instead of using official

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,600
government numbers people were simply

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:05,000
asked a group of people who simply asked

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,300
do you have a physical impairment or

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,550
disability something like that and that

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,790
was one point seven you could basically

00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:17,680
calculate that over to 1.7 million

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:20,270
Austrians just about you know 20 percent

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,370
but there are only but at the same time

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,020
later only like given those numbers

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,050
there are three hundred sixty two

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:31,040
thousand three hundred and eight

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:36,230
registered disabled in 2013 or so just

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,830
about 4% of the population other and in

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:42,320
my country worked in Iceland one the

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,580
general rule has been like one of every

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,110
five has a physical impairment in any

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,220
way

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,919
so essentially

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:56,659
we don't consider accessibility in your

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:59,360
work then these are the numbers of lost

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:02,000
customers these are the numbers of the

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,080
people you were pushing out that you

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,030
have to consider and it's not like these

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,330
people can do much about their

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,980
disability it's not like those people

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,900
who are still stuck with an old worst

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,760
you know went on an explorer and you

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,840
know could simply update their computer

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:25,280
or updated browser you know you don't

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,010
just upgrade your disability and those

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,330
with disabilities especially mobility

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:34,280
issues are likely to more likely to do

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,280
their business online or to or use

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,600
e-commerce sites especially if they can

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:45,710
do it easily without Matt's input it is

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,740
not always the case so the proportion of

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,380
the population that is disabled may of

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,740
course be different from the number of

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:58,309
customers who are on your let's say on

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:02,600
your online store then who are actually

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:04,659
disabled in a society so you may have

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,530
more or less depending on how you

00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:12,110
accommodate to them so essentially not

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:18,169
supporting users with permanent or

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:21,679
temporary disability issues is in fact a

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:23,090
moral decision just as much as it is a

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,490
business decision here you lose these

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,370
customers you could possibly write off

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,559
you know five to ten percent of your

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,980
potassium potential customers by not

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:38,240
making your site accessible but this is

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:41,360
also exclusion and there's also a key

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,440
element I mean this is common in in UI

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,710
testing you know sure if you do actual

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,780
UI testing with people then they will

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,230
give you feedback publish your website

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,940
ask people to come by or advertise it

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,510
you will not necessarily get the same

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,200
feedback people will just leave go with

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,409
it a competitor

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:11,539
and they will not you know waste their

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:13,830
you know days writing emails about how

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,389
inaccessible your website is it's a

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,369
waste of time because you can always go

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:20,279
somewhere else

00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:22,970
now a little very boring part we are

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:28,100
going to start arts and legality and

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:32,100
regulations and web accessibility so

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,629
especially in Europe any organization on

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,779
the national level in Europe

00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:39,239
accessibility regulations are generally

00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,669
based on the accessibility guidelines

00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:45,570
from the World Wide Web Consortium

00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:49,169
cultivate CAC they have mostly remained

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:52,559
unchanged since 2008 but did receive

00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:55,619
pattern update last year so I recommend

00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:03,600
checking out the way CAC 2.1 if you're

00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:07,159
already familiar with 2.0 so the

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,559
guidelines are essentially a list of

00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,169
minimal fulfillment criteria there is

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,409
needed to receive arrange a rating

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:19,529
ranging from well no rating and then you

00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:22,350
have single a double a or triple and you

00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:26,909
need to fulfill certain criteria to get

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,460
that for example you know having good

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:32,269
enough keyboard navigation having

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,190
alternative content to something that is

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:41,369
inaccessible for example good aim its

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:43,799
alt texts and when like I said before

00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:47,009
when regulated on a national level the

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:51,629
regulations may skip things from the

00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:54,960
original guidelines as an example the

00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:59,820
already you know has a heart requirement

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,619
for closed captioning which may be

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,179
possible in English or if you're a large

00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:09,690
broadcast organization but it really

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:12,710
doesn't work in all languages or all

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,710
regions or countries

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:21,060
and like Icelandic or Far East Greenland

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,360
eget would just never work out and while

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,560
we cake is not a new thing

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,670
recent developments especially with

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,410
JavaScript frameworks being under rapid

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:35,280
development in the past years

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,080
like I guess everybody here who has been

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,130
working with JavaScript for the past say

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,400
nine years I mean it's really hard to

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,730
keep up with the development just there

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,400
so this has led to the attention

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,130
switching really over to these new

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,660
frameworks and those new work methods

00:24:52,130 --> 00:25:01,140
from the attention that accessibility

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:02,820
was getting in the mid-2000s so but at

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,990
the same time there are all the things

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,760
like wai-aria that step in when it comes

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:15,900
to what we call grits internet

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:18,450
applications and this means we have both

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:22,380
new technologies to deal with with more

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,170
interactivity as and we also have those

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,230
regulate increased regulatory remarks

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,890
from the EU for instance to deal with at

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:35,040
the same time so if the organization or

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,540
if your client works for the government

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,220
in any context it could be the

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,050
municipality it could be a

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,630
non-government organisation then your

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:48,690
website needs to have minimal

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:51,030
accessibility and the legal liability in

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,150
question is not only moral but it can

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,520
also have financial consequences

00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,570
national authorities may issue fines and

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,280
even if it is not the case it can also

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,980
be dangerous waters to threat for

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,280
agencies and consultants that work for

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,340
public sector organisations if you run

00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,610
an agency and end-user and an end user

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:18,950
files legal action against your client

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:21,720
it may have a cascading effect on you so

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,680
you may become liable towards your

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,160
client if you did not fulfill or advise

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,800
on the legal requirements yourself it's

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,300
not necessarily common that I mean I've

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,430
worked in the public sector and you know

00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,020
public officials don't necessarily know

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,400
about all the rules they're supposed to

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:47,310
follow this is why you're hired as a

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:50,820
consultant and you may have clients that

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:53,700
say you know I just want a website but I

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,990
hope you're better than that and it's

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,520
very often just thrown out the window

00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:01,860
maybe an SEO consultant comes in and you

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,320
know replaces the accessibility work

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:09,150
with SEO but it should really hold at

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,860
the hand and but really like the

00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,050
technical tab that you collect by

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,540
ignoring accessibility is the sort of

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,830
it's closer to pouring ten thousand

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:21,210
dollars from from Tony Soprano then

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:26,070
getting an old trap from your bank and

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:28,320
Tony Soprano is not a nice guy so

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:32,370
pitfalls and misconceptions about

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,040
accessibility work one of the things

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:38,670
that I've seen on on websites that are

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,180
not in English is that labels are not

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,950
translated into the original language so

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,100
you may have let's say a date picker or

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,770
something at an airline the website is

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,040
in German but all of a sudden the screen

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:55,050
reader starts pronouncing English words

00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,960
with German accent and we can't

00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:02,580
understand anything and and one of the

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,640
things is that if you use one technology

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:10,110
like screamingly to check a website it

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,180
doesn't guarantee its accessibility in

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,550
any different context let's say contrast

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,870
or closed captioning for instance I mean

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:20,160
there are all of the months that you

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:22,400
have to follow and using a lighthouse

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,080
which is now included in Google Chrome

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,500
and it's a really good accessibility

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,420
auditing test it's an indicator it's not

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:35,490
an approval there are some things you

00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:39,480
may need to review manually

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:43,140
and delivering an accessible website to

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,070
a client does not guarantee the site

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,590
owner is going to keep it that way and

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:53,070
this means that while maintaining a site

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,340
it's important to make sure that the

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:58,679
content that is added later on and if

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,020
your client is you know takes over the

00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,480
technical maintenance of the site and

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,990
its tax IB enough to install plugins or

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,450
in short of doing some advanced editing

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:15,390
then the accessibility may recess in

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:18,960
fact yeah so essentially we should make

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:20,940
accessibility a part of our process from

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,289
the design phase to the development

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,720
phase and to throughout the whole

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:29,490
lifetime of the site and I saw this on

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,260
the street here in Vienna yesterday and

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,710
this is it like yeah this is an

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:37,230
accessible device next to a zebra

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,130
crossing only for blind people please

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,010
yes

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,779
but in fact good accessibility improves

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:46,320
things that are not necessarily related

00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:49,620
to disabled users shirts and chains and

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,010
web spiders may improve its crawling and

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,260
prioritize your website so you may have

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:59,789
get better rankings by having a very

00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:02,520
accessible site and X ability work may

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,149
not be the same s SEO but SEO and

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,500
accessibility halt hand-in-hand

00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:10,529
if you already have a code review

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,350
process then do include accessibility as

00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:17,220
a vital part of it and make sure not to

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:20,520
dismiss or you know make it consider

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,409
consider the nuisance at all stages as

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,039
an example in the Gutenberg Project

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:28,370
itself there was like a confirmation

00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,679
checkbox when you made a full request

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:35,279
about having taken accessibility into

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,240
account in your pull request but it was

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,820
usually just you know brushed off as a

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,820
formality especially as things were

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,800
getting rushed and everybody was like

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,380
rushing towards a release

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,420
and as a general rule the sooner you

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,020
discover issues with accessibility in

00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,490
any project easier it is to fix them

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,340
seeing and fixing them right at the

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,190
design phase is far less expensive and

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,320
problematical and then later in the

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,910
development stage even if the designer

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,220
you work with you know can't be annoyed

00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:14,040
or the project manager may get you know

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,010
sweaty palms when you talk about any

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:22,380
delay in work and listen to feedback

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:24,270
from users like sometimes accessibility

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,340
degrades over time and I've seen you

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,010
know important submit buttons just

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,980
disappearing from screen readers because

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:36,150
somebody wanted to remove it from the

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,470
tapping so in essence you are trusted by

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,250
your peers and co-workers and your

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:44,010
clients you were hired because you're a

00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,800
specialist in your field and your input

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:50,160
matters it doesn't matter how much you

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,110
know how much you know now if you're

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:56,240
interested in maintaining accessible

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:59,280
accessible sites then it does matter so

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,220
just give you a list of useful tools and

00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,800
information lighthouse is now pasted

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,750
into Google Chrome I'm a firefox person

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,640
myself but if I to accessibility other

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:14,400
things then I switched over to Chrome if

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:19,790
you go to accessible colors calm then

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:23,100
you can do this contrast checking and

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:25,920
there is playlists from Google on

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,679
YouTube called Ally cast which goes into

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,809
the details of accessibility work and of

00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,820
course just reading the specs you can

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:36,000
basically like it's the first thing that

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,760
pops up on Google this is lighthouse

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,340
there is now built into into Google

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,230
Chrome and this is like the last website

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,390
I worked on before at you automatic and

00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,880
it's basically saying you know there are

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,540
things to check out there things missing

00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,880
and things to check out manually but hey

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,790
wasn't this technical talk about how to

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,790
make Guttenberg blocks accessible yeah

00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:08,580
so in essence there is really this is

00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:11,640
all there is to know about keeping any

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,410
online content accessible if you are

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,510
careful enough not dealing with a

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,840
massive monolithic code base and

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:21,510
backwards compatibility issues so shirts

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,210
and chains and screen readers will be

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,370
your friends if your same ad if you use

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,900
somatic markup and if you're using

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,270
technologies like wai-aria

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,270
may cause you more issues than you think

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:36,210
you're fixing things like reinventing

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:38,790
the pattern using it is not really

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,059
something you want to do unless you've

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,700
really painted yourself in the corner I

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,190
do however recommend using the labeled

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,830
by Aria attribute if you need to place a

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,960
heading inside your block because as of

00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:54,750
now it's not easy for blocks to know

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,020
which heading level they're under so if

00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,900
there is like it's 2 or 8 3 above the

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,990
block then that block doesn't really

00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,370
know it's heading level at this in

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:09,919
therefore you can't really determine the

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:13,409
heading level inside the block however

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,290
blocks gave us an opportunity to read to

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,780
marker and other code especially with

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:23,909
the Goldenberg editor and compatible

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:25,260
themes in mind in case of pack and

00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,139
wordpress.com we have millions of users

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,179
and sites with lots of functionality and

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,490
hundreds of themes and we don't want to

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,369
break them even if we want to improve

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:38,730
things with potentially breaking changes

00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,550
so it's an opportunity to pay back this

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:44,070
technical tab to Tony saw problem

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:46,320
especially for the accessibility issues

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:50,369
that have been talking about and you can

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,790
keep legacy sides backwards compatible

00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,470
by simply not changing the output of

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,940
your short codes that you already have

00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:02,520
so I've seen this in some plugins now

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,820
there are claiming to support Gutenberg

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,160
and it's basically saying yeah I'm

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,070
rendering a block but it's actually a

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,770
shortcode and like I say you're painting

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:19,040
yourself in the corner by doing this

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:22,370
because you want to stay backwards

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,460
compatible with your old shortcuts but

00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:29,600
you do want to improve things in the

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:33,140
long run with the block editor one of

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:38,330
the things that we need to consider in

00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:41,690
the blocks is unique IDs so attributes

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:47,360
like Aria label by they you know depend

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:49,520
on things having unique IDs and it's

00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,850
basically common techniques for

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,300
accessible HTML in general like you both

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:58,760
for and IT so if we have multiple

00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:02,810
elements with the same ID attribute we

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,180
enter in a bit of a mess as I t's are

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,940
supposed to be unique so the reference

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,060
will always be towards the first element

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:13,400
in your code with that I t so even if

00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,440
it's a sibling that is referring to

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,200
another sibling it'll always just go to

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,820
top of the HTML and find the first I T

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,580
[Music]

00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:29,030
for instance like this is you know just

00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:34,190
a an example of a div that I made last

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:41,020
night where where the tabe itself is

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:43,790
referring to the name as the title for

00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,160
the tip so this is what you can use in

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:50,510
your blocks for instance instead of

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:53,840
specifying or inserting automatically

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:57,320
correct heading you can specify a span

00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,660
or a paragraph as a heading using Aria

00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:07,190
labels but what if we have multiple

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:09,080
blocks like this that we need to find

00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,330
the solution and that that means we need

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:16,190
you a unique ID for the block itself for

00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:21,860
that instance all the block and PHP be

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:24,890
use unique ID and it outputs a random

00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,210
string based on the current microsecond

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:29,270
time step so

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:32,570
it's not cryptographically secure it

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,540
happens during runtime but it seems to

00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,120
be good enough for you know what I've

00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,280
used it for until now and on the

00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,530
JavaScript and Gutenberg site on the

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,310
JavaScript side you can use with

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:51,650
instanceid which is the object class so

00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:56,420
here is the PHP site in related posts in

00:37:51,650 --> 00:38:01,250
Japan as you can see I'm using unique ID

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:03,380
to indicate the unique ID for that

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,090
specific instance all related for sure

00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,360
if you have a list outpost and you have

00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:14,420
this block in it then it will generate a

00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:17,650
unique ID on the JavaScript side it's a

00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,270
bit more complicated but you essentially

00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,340
well there is an error this is

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,530
essentially a screenshot from the

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,730
documentation in the Gutenberg code

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:32,120
paste but you're supposed to import

00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:37,610
compose as well this is how we get a

00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:42,020
unique ID for that specific block that

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:45,320
you are working with at any given time

00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:48,620
so you don't have to end like a in both

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,620
these cases you don't have to worry

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:55,990
about conflicting IDs in your blocks and

00:38:51,620 --> 00:39:00,470
this is essentially the basics of how

00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:04,910
you may make your blocks accessible

00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:07,550
without breaking everything yeah so

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:10,090
that's the end of the slides any

00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,090
questions

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,619
so I see that you kept a lot of links in

00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,869
the slides where can people find them

00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:27,359
after the talk you can go to Alta big

00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:33,569
distort wordpress.com I will scroll up

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:35,819
here so yeah great so after the talk a

00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:38,640
lot a lot lot of strides over slides

00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:42,390
over here and you should be able to find

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,950
them on my wordpress.com block okay so

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:53,520
does anybody have any questions for

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:56,190
alder right I would like to know if the

00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,660
WordPress dashboard is also accessible

00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:03,720
or is going to be accessible the - per

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,089
the back office of the WordPress yeah

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,960
exactly I mean that's just as important

00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:11,970
as having the website itself or the

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,910
front end itself to keep it accessible

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:20,819
and the WordPress WP admin CMS we're all

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:24,119
using has you know 15 years of history

00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:26,130
of accessibility work to it and this is

00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,260
really what created this massive debate

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,250
last year around the release of

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,339
Guttenberg was that we were losing a lot

00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,829
of this work in the new editor so there

00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:41,790
are accessibility improvements going on

00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:48,260
in a new editor in the classic WP admin

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:50,579
you will have a 15-year backlog of

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:58,619
really good community action ability

00:40:50,579 --> 00:41:01,240
work so any other questions come on with

00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:12,130
your time ask something

00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:17,850
right I've heard that it's important for

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:21,550
users in in the backend like also to

00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:25,930
that they are presented the blocks in

00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:29,820
the way they can easily find and use

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:33,730
them and I've also had been in the new

00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:38,140
WordPress version there will be the

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:41,820
possibility to to arrange the order of

00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:45,490
blocks is that right yeah so basically

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,500
Gutenberg is coming in to what we

00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:51,610
historically call the sidebar widgets

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:55,050
though so this is also providing an

00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:57,880
opportunity to rework them as well so

00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:01,350
that's really work that we can still

00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:08,050
copy from the legacy code in any case so

00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:10,600
yeah this is already being done okay so

00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:13,480
if we have no further questions I have

00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,760
last one tomorrow the contributor they

00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,470
are going to be around in case anybody

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,420
wants to contribute to accessibility in

00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,520
Gutenberg absolutely I'll be there at

00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,850
least in the morning and in the early

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,160
afternoon so if you want to ask anything

00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,500
else or try to contribute to

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,270
accessibility in WordPress I guess you

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,900
can contact no later

00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,900
