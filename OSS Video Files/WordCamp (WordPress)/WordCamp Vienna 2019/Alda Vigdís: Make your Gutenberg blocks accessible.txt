Description: 
	Web accessibility can be tricky, especially as the main focus of many WordPress developers right now is to get into learning Gutenberg and React.

Make your blocks more accessible and learn how to use correct semantic markup, use ARIA tags to tame it and get a crash course in accessibility as a term that encompasses best practices, inclusivity, regulation and SEO.
