Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Vienna 2019
Description: 
	To democratize publishing, internationalization is just one of many barriers that WordPress needs to overcome. That’s why for 2020 and beyond, the goal is to find an official way to build multilingual websites. Up until now, this was considered to be plugin territory. But what is needed to make WordPress a true polyglot?
This talk covers the status quo of multilingual WordPress websites and shares some ideas — both from a technical and a user perspective — on how WordPress could evolve in this area over the next few years.
