Title: Pascal Birchler: Multilingual WordPress - An Exploration
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Vienna 2019
Description: 
	To democratize publishing, internationalization is just one of many barriers that WordPress needs to overcome. That’s why for 2020 and beyond, the goal is to find an official way to build multilingual websites. Up until now, this was considered to be plugin territory. But what is needed to make WordPress a true polyglot?
This talk covers the status quo of multilingual WordPress websites and shares some ideas — both from a technical and a user perspective — on how WordPress could evolve in this area over the next few years.

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,080
Hey hello

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,270
thanks for having me today and I was the

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,190
last talk of the day please don't fall

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,920
asleep so this talk is for everyone who

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,910
speaks more than one language which is

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,510
probably everyone in here today I want

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,560
to explore some of the available options

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,750
out there to create multilingual

00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,490
WordPress websites and what it would

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,480
take to build these capabilities right

00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,730
into WordPress core so for those who

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,890
don't know me yet my name is Pascal and

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,760
I somehow ended up doing lots of

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,559
internationalization stuff in WordPress

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
my wordpress core committer and as you

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,980
mentioned I'm currently working on

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,420
Google's basically the googles WordPress

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,160
team and you can find me on twitter at

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:08,980
swiss speedy or swiss body where i will

00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,630
share the link to my slides later

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,940
so before we jump right into this topic

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,060
i first want to talk about the backstory

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,640
of this so as I mentioned I've been very

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,420
active in the intelligence Asian area

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,310
and WordPress for quite some time now

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,140
but why I am am I giving this

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,049
presentation about multilingual websites

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,540
now it's not I'm not here just because I

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:37,040
like Vienna it's because something

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,490
happens during last year's state of the

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,409
world

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,720
keynote by WordPress co-founder Matt

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,430
Mullenweg he announced that the next

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,640
phase or one of the next phases phase

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,060
four of Guttenberg would focus on

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,520
developing an official way for WordPress

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,100
to support multilingual websites and

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,920
there was a big announcement as no such

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,689
plans existed in the past and even now

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,570
there are no technical details we opted

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:05,560
for what approach of what approach core

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,390
will take is still a long way off

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,180
Tania's keynote actually Matt mentioned

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,530
that Gutenberg phase 4 is targeted for

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,600
the year 2020 and beyond and given that

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,880
we are still in phase 2 of Gutenberg

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,940
where witches are slowly being converted

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,100
to blocks 2020 is probably a bit too

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,220
optimistic for that

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,470
but still people already started to

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,230
speculate about the impact of core

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,630
offering its own standardized solution

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,210
for multilingual sites and what that

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:43,700
solution might look like and today we

00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:47,300
are going to speculate as well so this

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,130
new commitment to multilingual sites can

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,980
make sense for WordPress when you think

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,960
about it almost every CMS are open

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,350
source CMS or platform out there already

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,930
has multilingual capabilities WordPress

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,520
is the only one without and if WordPress

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,710
doesn't fall it doesn't want to fall

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,780
behind the competition and reach more

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,800
users around the globe it needs to do

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,320
something about it the good thing is

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,350
WordPress actually is already marginal

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,990
at least in some way it has not

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,040
completely fallen behind or anything

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,040
WordPress is a strong international

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,720
community and some powerful multilingual

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,790
features so let's have a closer look at

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,670
WordPress internalization for a little

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:35,870
bit first of all I'd like to point out

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,660
WordPress has been caring about other

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,510
languages than just American English for

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,700
a long time already so in version 1.2

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,920
WordPress added support for

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,100
international localization so that was

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,170
15 years ago and despite their not being

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,170
that many international contributors to

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,700
our process at that point - mostly

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,610
english-speaking people there recognized

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,010
the importance of such a feature and I

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,550
was translating WordPress into any

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:08,270
language one wants to so currently

00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:12,290
WordPress can be translated into over

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:15,800
100 or like even 200 locales and many of

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,180
these translations are complete orders

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,910
need more contributors so if you

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,830
download the translation for Africa some

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,780
of my favorite language to romance an

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,760
official Swiss language it's like 30

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,870
percent complete but you can translate

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,520
it

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm not aware of any other open source

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,790
CMS that has that many active

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,470
translations Plus these are not only

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,800
translations for WordPress itself but

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,420
also for plugins themes even the mobile

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,940
apps of WordPress can be translated into

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:50,610
these languages this is also reflected

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,920
in the statistics available on web

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,880
rhetoric and is sure that the majority

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,230
of WordPress sites are not in US English

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,490
so that's a lot of sites if you think

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,870
about it of workers like powering

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,990
millions of web sites around the globe

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,600
and that's why we're always trying to

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:12,420
improve English sorry trying to prove

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:14,070
WordPress for non-english speakers one

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,590
example a rather recent one in that

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,760
history we added a feature to WordPress

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,230
that allows every user on your website

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,350
to choose their own preferred language

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,060
when working with WordPress so it's not

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,040
just one language anymore that workers

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,040
can be used in but actually many

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,420
languages at the same time but this of

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,790
course only effects of our procedure

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:40,260
interface and not the content of your

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:43,800
website but what about multilingual

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,110
content well every time this has been

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
brought up in the past one will be told

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,060
that it's not something that is of

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,060
importance at the moment it's not needed

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,850
by most users or it's not is easy to do

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,830
because WordPress is so complex and most

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,560
famously you have been told that it's

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:06,390
plug-in territory just install a plug-in

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,550
for that the idea behind that is quite

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,490
simple that WordPress core itself should

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:15,180
be small and lean and everything else

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,740
should be handled by plugins and that's

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,840
what the plugin ecosystem is there for

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,840
and at least that's the thinking

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:31,290
nevertheless there have been some

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,100
efforts in the past to make WordPress a

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:38,120
true multilingual CMS I'm briefly going

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,820
to highlight some of them

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,949
first there was babble not to be

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,110
confused with the JavaScript runs for

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,150
the pilot called babble babble was a

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,729
wordpress plugin developed by an agency

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,669
called code for the people like six or

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,490
seven years ago its main selling point

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,979
was that it's using built-in

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,050
functionality and at the time it was the

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:05,039
only working at the only one working

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:08,280
well on wordpress.com VIP which caught

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,169
the interest of automatic so the agency

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,139
has been acquired by automatic around

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,050
five years ago and the plugin was

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:21,389
discontinued after that so it's no

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,400
longer an option next there was this

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,340
proposal by fellow were present easiest

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Casper who Binger from Germany he

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,660
figured that if a complete multilingual

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,760
website solution would be too big of a

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,650
task for our too big of an undertaking

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,349
for wordpress there should be at least

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,419
like the absolute minimum a field where

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,280
he can just declare the language a post

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,280
has been written in just a simple select

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,410
box and this proposal actually gained

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,720
some momentum among core contributors

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:57,570
and inspired more people to look at

00:07:48,720 --> 00:08:00,270
multilingual WordPress again so this was

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,400
like four years ago and it led to some

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,669
very active discussions to work in

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,099
Europe 2015 in Seville and a working

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,360
group has been formed to look into the

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:13,680
requirements and hurdles for

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,240
multilingual support in WordPress as you

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,270
might be able to see on the screenshot

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,240
here the last post on that block was

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,250
from November 2015 so unfortunately that

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,690
momentum didn't last long

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,970
but there were certainly some

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,920
interesting ideas being shared there

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,080
which might be picked up again in the

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,130
future so one of the suggestion was to

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,750
add new columns to the database tables

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,700
she's bad if specify the language for a

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,830
poser term just for better performance

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:48,750
and like actual built-in multilingual

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:50,850
capability let's take a step back real

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,370
quick and ask ourselves like what would

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,870
multilingual support and workers look

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,870
like if we could build it from scratch

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,850
um after all WordPress is a massive

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,250
project and there's a lot of things to

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,410
consider when when doing that but if you

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:10,050
have a like blank canvas there would be

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:12,050
no limits so what's needed first and

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,940
foremost we start with the most

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,680
important piece of content to post one

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,170
needs to be able to translate posts and

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,870
pages and and other content types in

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,150
whatever language they like there are

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,490
also needs to be an easy way to edit the

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,900
current post in another language and are

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,920
like a connection between the

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,380
translation and the same goes for

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,390
categories and tags and any other

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,050
content type editable in WordPress

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,940
really next you perhaps want to

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,280
translate some posts with lots of visual

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,560
elements but you don't want to upload

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,630
all the images twice so there would be

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,810
like some intelligent functionality to

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,250
kind of share the same images between

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,580
posts but you still need to like have

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,280
translated to image captions for example

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,650
and with the new block editor everything

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,620
WordPress is going to be a block in the

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,860
future so newsletter widget a block

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,960
custom navigation menu a block and this

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,500
will be translatable as well so this

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,480
needs to be accounted for too

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,930
then of course you need to like waiter

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,069
like different URLs for each translation

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,879
so that your websites gonna be like

00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:26,790
example that calm slash de slash

00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:29,910
whatever and that's like for SEO and

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,379
usability reasons and they need to be

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,079
linked to each other so that you can

00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,300
easily navigate to another language

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,600
after another translation of the current

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,730
post and of course this all is to be

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,730
first activating multilingual support

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,199
should not suddenly slow down your site

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,230
de Stael despite there being added

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,170
complexity and optimizing for that

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,939
already starts at a database layer and

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:57,649
continues through to the presentation

00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,649
layer for websites like your theme

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,540
usability multilingual support should

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,089
not negatively infect the content

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:11,610
writing experience and ideally it's

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:14,399
barely noticeable what if you want to

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,439
hire in an external agency that

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,059
translates your content like actual

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,009
professionals that know a language that

00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:22,589
you don't so there should be some kind

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:25,290
of API that they can I get existing

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:27,600
content from your site and ideally

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,639
directly publish translations from their

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,889
own systems and in the end you just have

00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,449
to put all the pieces together

00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:39,540
connecting the dots so you will end up

00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:41,550
with a multilingual solution that it's

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,620
not just fast but also very easy to use

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,680
and basically leaves no questions

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,779
unanswered so no matter if you're like a

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,699
personal blogger like small business or

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,189
like a huge corporation with offices

00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:57,899
around the world you can just use

00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:59,699
WordPress just works now you might have

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,360
realized that sounds a bit unrealistic

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:06,029
can a utopic we cannot build WordPress

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,569
from scratch but instead we have to work

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,250
with what we've already got so let's

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:14,420
have a look at what we can actually do

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,420
at this very moment

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,480
before so for this I picked five

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,370
different WordPress plugins that allow

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,320
you to turn your site into a

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:34,589
multilingual one one of them is a cute

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,120
translate or cute translate X it is one

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,300
of the oldest oldest plugins out there

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,080
for multilingual WordPress sites

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,930
unfortunately it has been pretty much

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,080
abandoned by its developer so with no

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,140
updates in over three years however it

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,060
is a successor called cute translate XT

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,060
I think it's like a community project

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,670
that aims to revive the original project

00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,330
and maintain it competitively with the

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,820
latest updates of WordPress the problem

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,680
with huge translate is is that all the

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,140
translated content is stored in the same

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,140
post like the same text field basically

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:13,140
and that doesn't scale and it doesn't

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,880
scale with blocks at all so it's not

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,410
compatible with the new block editor so

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,020
you still have to use the old editor if

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,850
you want to use huge site so my

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:25,290
recommendation is like please look at

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,750
other options one such option is called

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,089
poly lang it is one of my personal

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,770
favorites and other one of the most

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,460
popular multilingual plugins out there

00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:37,470
with over 400,000 active installs poly

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,350
Lang uses separate posts for

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,540
translations and uses taxonomies to link

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,130
these translations together which i

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,990
think is a really neat way of doing that

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,080
with it within the boundaries of

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,210
WordPress and compared to queue

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,460
translate the UI of polar lang is much

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,890
cleaner you can see the regular block

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,720
editor here and only in the sidebar in

00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,339
the corner there you have a small box

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,080
where you can manage two translations

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,140
and change the language of the current

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,450
post that's the kind of usability you'd

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,200
want to see in WordPress for

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,490
multilingual stuff besides probably lang

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,430
and Q translate

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:17,580
there's also wpml it's a paid solution

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,160
it tries to cover almost every aspect of

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,370
dealing with languages within WordPress

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,650
and is probably as old as Q translate

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,470
so that means it grew a lot over time

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,390
and it's now quite happy waited I use a

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,250
lot of custom database tables and

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:36,810
workarounds for core limitations

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,490
multilingual press is another contender

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,800
in the field and it just recently

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,320
published a new completely refactored

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,780
version and while previous versions have

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,900
been partially free this one is a paid

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:52,080
solution as well interestingly

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,300
multilingual press users to multi-site

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,000
capabilities of WordPress to turn your

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,030
site into a multilingual one this is a

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,380
very neat approach because multi-site

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,200
gives you a lot of additional powers

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,180
within WordPress and it might be a bit

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,530
overwhelming though because like could

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,110
be too much if you just want to have

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,720
like um just want to translate a few

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,540
posts here there but in case you are

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,760
building websites on wordpress.com VIP

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,560
for example this is their actually

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,860
recommended solution and at the moment

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,480
the last one I want to mention is we got

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,210
there actually sponsor of this very work

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,680
up here they haven't been around for

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,780
that long yet they already have like

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,870
20,000 active installs on workers

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,560
targeting what makes me clot so

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,150
different from from all the others its

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,640
software as a service that aims to

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,160
translate all your content automatically

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,220
or using professional translation

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,260
services and and because it's a software

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,320
as a service it's not just for WordPress

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,150
is for other platforms as well and

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,620
because it's an external service if you

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,950
install the plugin all you need to do is

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,820
basically enter your api key and set the

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:08,190
languages that you want to support but

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,620
because everything else happens on their

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,660
servers it's not really a solution that

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:20,600
could be implemented or like integrated

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:22,279
into WordPress core so if you try to

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,589
these are everyone compare these five

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,899
plugins we can broadly use four terms to

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:30,829
categorize them first we have the

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,509
customized approach and WordPress way we

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,940
got is far away from using the WordPress

00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,440
functionality as all the translation

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,750
stuff is being handled on an external

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,329
platform and the other hand we have poly

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,130
bang and multilingual press as examples

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:47,149
of using native for press functionality

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,980
like taxonomies and multi-site and

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:53,600
second we have like the automated way

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,399
like we lot unless we are like unless

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,069
you hire professional translators for

00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,100
you and the other plugins also allow you

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:02,540
to hire external translators but their

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:10,429
whole selling point is that they enable

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:13,189
you to translate your content so having

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,510
explored these existing solutions and

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,480
the things we want to see an ideal

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:22,630
solution let's slow down and think about

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,630
what's really or was actually realistic

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,419
given the sheer amount of requirements

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,059
for a multilingual solution and seeing

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,289
the differences of the existing plugins

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,270
it has become clear that there's no

00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,270
one-size-fits-all solution

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,059
there's no multilingual Swiss Army knife

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,760
for WordPress so whatever we end up

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:46,010
adding to WordPress needs to be small

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,620
and flexible enough that it works for

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,289
many users out of the box but for any

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,870
extra wishes you should be able to

00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:56,740
extend it and maybe like install another

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,090
plugin that builds on top of that

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,880
another thing to be considered is

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,740
backward compatibility we cannot risk

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,679
adding multilingual functional to

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,289
WordPress and breaking lots of fights by

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,169
doing that so we need to do it in a way

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:14,000
that is both backward and compatible and

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:18,080
also future proof in case we want to

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,640
iterate on that later and for anyone who

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,580
knows the codebase of WordPress and how

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,020
all it is you know that this is not

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,020
going to be a trivial undertaking

00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:36,710
so because WordPress cannot have a

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,210
one-size-fits-all solution it needs to

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,170
implement in such a way that seams and

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,100
plugins can easily interact with it

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,410
years ago that would just mean like

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,270
adding some hooks and filters in the

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,550
codebase for developers to extend

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,950
solutions but nowadays this WordPress is

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,260
way more complex we have a REST API now

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,320
we have a block editor everything is

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,750
going to be a block and it means any

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,640
extensibility needs to way more thorough

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:08,540
thinking than just adding some filters

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:12,290
here care so at this point we're left

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,990
wondering what's next when is this

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,059
coming when can you have multiple

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,929
WordPress websites out-of-the-box how

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,960
can I help how can I get involved so the

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,429
short answer is the time hasn't come yet

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,860
as I mentioned before phase four of

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,300
Guttenberg has been planned for 2020 and

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,280
beyond

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,290
before that the focus is fully on site

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,080
customization and further improving

00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:39,260
Guttenberg no work has yet begun on

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,780
multilingual support however it is

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,000
important to keep in mind with the

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,040
current to like to keep and keep it in

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,960
mind with the current development so

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,470
just keep it like in the back of your

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,510
head and as the things we built today

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:59,330
affect what we what and how we can build

00:19:53,510 --> 00:20:01,400
things tomorrow many people including of

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,170
course the folks behind multilingual

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,360
press has mentioned that they see

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:08,570
WordPress multi-site as the ideal

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,160
solution for this endeavor and since

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,410
motor side is already powerful part of

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,570
WordPress that is supported with both

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,790
themes and plugins it might be worth

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,559
looking into how we can how it could be

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,290
utilized for multilingual sites by

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,360
default but with like hiding all the

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,290
complexity that is associated with

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,340
multi-site so we need to find a way to

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:35,169
utilize it for translations

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,760
it's gonna be very interesting so if

00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,340
you're interested in this exciting new

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,620
chapter of Webber's I highly recommend

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,440
you to get involved in making your voice

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,929
heard today even though work hasn't yet

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,029
as yet to start now's a great time to

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:51,330
get involved with the community and get

00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,770
yourself familiar with the code and

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,830
contributing to WordPress core and the

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,090
current phases of Gutenberg development

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,130
all the current multilingual plug-in

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,230
developers out there are already looking

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,789
forward to this as well as it means they

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,010
will be able to greatly simplify their

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:11,169
code bases and they can offer a much

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:13,510
improved experience for their users if

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,370
there's any progress and multilingual

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,700
WordPress you will likely hear it first

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,440
on make that work result org or and

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,120
especially make that WordPress org slash

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,950
core and also on WordPress slack you can

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,120
also be pretty sure that I will tweet

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:33,480
about any developments in that area

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,480
thank you very much

00:21:40,320 --> 00:22:13,539
so thank you Pascal any questions hi um

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:16,450
I live really like it's a fallback right

00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:18,610
oh if German too is a fallback for the

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,950
Germans see because otherwise your ways

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:24,039
end up with a mixed english and german

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,350
version is this something you would

00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,289
consider in the future

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,570
very good point charm is a very complex

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,710
language that regards with the formal

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,960
and informal stuff the good thing is I'm

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:41,049
developing a plugin that allows you to

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,080
set different fallbacks for your

00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:46,240
language so you can have like formal

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,549
German as the default and whenever that

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,520
is not available it'll pick the informal

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,760
one and you could even have like Spanish

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,770
as another fallback if you want so this

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,980
is currently in development and should

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:06,580
be in core at some point that you can do

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:08,380
this like right out of out of the box so

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,960
that multi-site approach you were

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,150
talking about I think that's a really

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,880
good idea the question I have is how

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:19,059
well do those multi site plugins that

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,860
use that approach work when you have an

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:28,059
actual multi site that you want to

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:30,610
translate good question so the good

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:31,900
thing is or like with everything made

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,929
but it makes everything a bit more

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,419
complex you can have a multi site with

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,030
different sites and each side can be a

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,100
multi site on its own again

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,640
so you can have like a multi-sided has

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:49,170
translated and they can still be like

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,170
like networks of networks kind of thing

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,190
depending of actual implementation of

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,550
how that's going to look like it's like

00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:01,030
still open and how good the support is

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:02,830
going to be you'll see and you don't

00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,860
know how that works with the plugins

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,990
that are currently out there yeah well

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,300
the problem like I would say many

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,120
plugins would just work but there's just

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:16,300
too many plugins and not all of them are

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:21,850
really well written so there's always

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:34,180
going to be some breakage awesome

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:37,450
any more questions oh there thanks for a

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:40,590
great presentation just a quickie and

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,860
maybe I missed it from the talk but

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:47,080
Europe developer what would you

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,470
personally at this moment think would be

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,740
the best approach or at least a starting

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,750
point for doing this so if you want to

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:01,060
build a multilingual website today with

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:03,880
WordPress or know it took like creating

00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:12,400
multilingual WordPress in a core like

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:15,130
how would you approach it multilingual

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,200
web well the front end should not be

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,180
like that big of a difference should

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,970
look the same as always it just have

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,310
like a language navigation mostly

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,900
effects like the content writing like

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,900
the back in part of workers

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:53,700
right should I go back to so for example

00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:58,769
this is how editing in in Poland looks

00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:01,289
like um so ideally really if you added

00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:02,909
content I would plug in just set the

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:04,739
translate like the language of your post

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:07,499
and on the front end there should be no

00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:09,779
difference at all the only thing that is

00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,909
important is that in the code it's

00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,369
highlighted that this is like written in

00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:16,619
Spanish or something that browsers and

00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:18,119
search engines understand but on the

00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:24,389
front end it like should have no impact

00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:26,429
at all can we yeah sorry but what I

00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,200
meant is like how would you approach it

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,450
would you look you you personally like

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,889
use multi-site would you use additional

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:37,649
tables columns this is what I meant well

00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:39,929
as I said is like a trader like ideally

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,539
will have like changing the database

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:45,629
tables in WordPress but it's gonna be

00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,950
hard to not break anything so the boot

00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:48,139
side approach is really like worth

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,059
looking into

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,739
but also I like the way how poliwag does

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,440
it with the taxonomies because it's also

00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:57,599
wordpress functionality and the plugin

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,330
is proven that it works by not breaking

00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,940
too many other plugins um it really

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,889
depends on your use case multi-site is

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,159
also really interesting when you have

00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:10,950
like websites for like different

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,889
countries where it not only effects the

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,109
content but also like you have like

00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:18,599
other content that is only specific to

00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:21,320
that country which is way easier for

00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:24,989
multi-site and you can also just say

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,629
user a only has access for the chairman

00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:29,629
Germany website and not everything else

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,970
Thank You Pascal do you have any

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,489
experience in dealing multiple languages

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,450
left to right and right to left in the

00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:45,350
mean time

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:47,360
you mean in the content editing for well

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,560
my website is for example is playing

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,560
English and Ebru

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:59,120
okay so there's for right-to-left

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,540
languages like Hebrew there's a lot of

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,540
things to consider

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:08,900
obviously like everything is flip I I

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,280
know that Gutenberg has some support for

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,800
right-to-left languages but it's not

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,140
perfect yet and especially you I can be

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,120
a bit tricky if you're a developer and

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,570
once you have like a theme that fully

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,290
supports right to left language is one

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,780
thing I really like it's called RTL CSS

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:28,580
so that it's like a script or like

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,600
something that you can integrate in your

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,030
process and basically takes your CSS and

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,130
wherever there's like float:left it

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,730
turns it into float:right so it's like

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:43,130
the opposite for these languages that is

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:49,400
really cool so it takes a lot of work

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:53,890
off your shoulders as a developer more

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,890
questions one last question maybe

00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:06,350
everyone's looking forward to the after

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:08,330
party already awesome well oh so at this

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,330
moment of time from a user point of view

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:14,140
which of the tools or plugins that you

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,520
mentioned would you actually recommend

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,800
well I can say we closed because they're

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,920
here

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,100
so I used I think most of times and past

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,600
I used polyline because it's very simple

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,740
in the user for an interface is super

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,210
easy

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:35,420
multilingual press not that much because

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,010
like a was a paid solution and might be

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,150
too much if you're just like I have a

00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,090
small website that needs to be

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,920
translated but as soon there's like more

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,410
complexity you should be looking into

00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,770
something like that really depends on a

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,770
use case

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,510
okay last one relate the last last last

00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,980
one okay thank you

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:03,039
[Applause]
