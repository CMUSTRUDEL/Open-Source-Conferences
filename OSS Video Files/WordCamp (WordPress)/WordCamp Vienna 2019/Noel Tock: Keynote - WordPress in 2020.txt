no talk cool yeah

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,260
thanks so much for that can you guys

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
hear me all right at the back of the

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,789
room

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,460
great cool so before we get talking

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,340
about the the future of WordPress and

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,829
where we need to keep an eye on for next

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,739
year I think it's worth maybe going back

00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:57,280
a bit in time I built my first web site

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,050
in 1995 which was quite a while ago but

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,410
I only made the jump from hobby to

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,740
professional much later on and WordPress

00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,410
was a really big contributor to that

00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:11,979
this was the wordpress.org website back

00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:15,130
in 2010 and even though I began with

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,979
playing with WordPress around 2008 I'd

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,650
say I think 2010 was the big year for me

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,000
because that was that was a turning

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,530
point when custom post types were

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,720
introduced and and to me that was like

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,130
the future at that point because I

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,420
wasn't interested in blogging but I was

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,909
interested in WoW because some post

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,560
types I can do anything I want which is

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,140
really cool so that feature probably at

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,090
the single largest impact on I don't

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,119
know my career in WordPress maybe back

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,509
then which is quite cool but you can see

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,369
that the pitch back then was WordPress

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:47,950
is a state of the art publishing

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:52,240
platform with a focus on aesthetics web

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,299
standards and usability so the scope was

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,189
also limited to blogging it wasn't you

00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,630
know necessarily about websites if you

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,250
look at the WordPress website today it

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,850
says hey this is for blogging this is

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,590
for websites and even applications which

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,020
is pretty crazy in terms of how broad

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,390
this has all become and keep in mind

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,080
WordPress was already 11% of the web at

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:17,530
the time now I've dug this out of the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,930
archives this is my website at the time

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,459
almost ten years ago and some thing

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,109
we'll give away the age almost

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,959
immediately I think the the green

00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:29,599
checkmarks with the gradient are pretty

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,230
dead giveaway of probably terrible

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,640
design I'm showing this here I didn't

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,400
even realize this this was a slider

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,359
until like yesterday when I noticed the

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,269
three circles at the top so great user

00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:46,129
experience there um the lighting in the

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,040
shadow is the shadows and everything are

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,659
all completely different I mean all in

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,909
all I'm quite happy but that wasn't the

00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:54,760
largest shock factor I think that the

00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,349
largest shock for me was the language

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,680
all right and so I was looking at this

00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:02,959
and I used words like stunning and look

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,599
great similar to how wordpress.org talks

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,469
about being aesthetic right there was

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,510
this large focus on the visual and that

00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,939
makes a lot of sense back then SEO and

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,010
marketing was quite easy you know like

00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,900
you'd publish a page it would get ranked

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,950
you get traffic and everything was okay

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:27,049
but different story done nowadays and to

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,889
me that era the goal was to in many ways

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:35,569
was to exist right it was to have a

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:39,109
website online to go from 0 to 1 and so

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:41,989
if the restaurant down the street had a

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,189
website and the other restaurants around

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,709
it did not have a website

00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:49,669
it was winning you know that was kind of

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,290
the name of the game back then so that

00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,209
was that was very interesting at the

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,970
time because there was no competition so

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:59,709
going online was both the process and

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:03,069
the goal and the end result and in one

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:06,790
and we'll come back to this topic after

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:11,930
so today as Martin already mentioned

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:15,560
WordPress is already 33% of the web oh

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,750
cool thanks so WordPress is ready 33% of

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,750
the web and taken you know at face value

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,180
that's an incredible number you know

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,949
there's there's no CMS other CMS or

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,400
other tool or application with that kind

00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,330
of brand that even comes close and

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,889
looking over that looking at that

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,849
journey over the past decade you know

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:37,249
custom post types thousands of plugins

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,779
an easy easy theming engine which

00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:41,479
connects the back end to the front end

00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,639
all help to really fuel that growth

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,439
which we've seen and that's why many of

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,419
us are here today we had this easy

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,830
ability to just go online and produce

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:57,979
something but you know like I'd argue

00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:00,080
that that is 33% that we see today you

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,029
know it isn't just more of the same it

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,189
isn't just that hey there's more plugins

00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,719
there's more themes and we're going to

00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,659
more work camps that's why the number

00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:10,249
went from 11 to 22 to 33%

00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:12,019
I don't think that's the case at all or

00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:15,469
rather that it's just not as simple as

00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:18,860
that so to help us with that I've made a

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:21,409
little chart and this chart shows us on

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,999
the left side at Google Trends data I

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,249
think most of you are familiar with

00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:27,349
Google Trends it shows you interest for

00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:30,949
a particular topic and that's that's

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:33,139
wide wide-ranging interest so in the

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,869
case of Google it's mostly search volume

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,749
and how interested the population at

00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:41,779
large is and we can see that you know a

00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:43,309
number hundred in this case is most

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:46,279
interest that WordPress what I've ever

00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:49,219
gotten at a certain point in time so if

00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,769
we look at let's say 2012 we can see

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,869
that from then on the market share has

00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:57,050
doubled you know so we've gone from 17

00:05:53,869 --> 00:06:00,019
to 33 percent but this this consumer

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,289
interest around this global brand called

00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:06,229
WordPress has halved which is very

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,959
interesting and I'd like to be able to

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,269
dig you know quite a bit deeper in that

00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,699
today to help understand you know how

00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:17,990
that's come to be and what that means

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:20,959
for us going forward so the first thing

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,629
I'd like to talk about is the greater

00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:27,349
you know web ecosystem that WordPress is

00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:29,559
a part of when the goal for when a goal

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,110
for for a website was simply to exist

00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:36,259
you know you used to be able to build an

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,269
entire website and WordPress that hasn't

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,669
changed you can still build an entire

00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:44,479
website in WordPress it's just not as

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:48,560
competitive as it used to be right

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,919
and that's because you know the people

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,099
you might not be able to engage people

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,110
as frequently as you used to you might

00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,819
might mean you're not able to discover

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,400
new people to come to your website as

00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,349
you used to so you have to grow beyond

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,710
WordPress and acquire other tools and be

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:08,900
part of a larger ecosystem and together

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,509
those various tools then form the new

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,880
solution and a great way of

00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,610
understanding this is by I think looking

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,220
at some of the core features or main

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,900
plugins that we used to use or sometimes

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,310
still use today but are slowly

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,919
transitioning out to third-party

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,199
solutions so let's look at a few

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,409
examples mmm

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,710
I've searched who uses WordPress search

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,300
on their website anybody okay of a few

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,550
of you okay cool

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,970
Martin I'm surprised I'll have to talk

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,800
about this later but search is one of

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,630
these interesting things because if you

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,669
have a small website and you have great

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,620
content architecture you don't really

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,729
need to have search all right there's

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,169
there's there's not a large point

00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,780
because otherwise you're trying to make

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,969
up for a deficiency if you have a very

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,690
large website you probably do need

00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:01,870
search but the problem is that oh no no

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,030
it's a good problem to have but search

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,889
nowadays the expectations from the

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,840
consumer have become much much larger

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,400
right we've been using Google for I

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,259
don't know how many years all of us in

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,110
this room

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:17,599
99% I'd assume have been using Google to

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,490
a certain extent so weeks we expect that

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,580
kind of search experience to occur on

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,569
large websites that we visit we expect

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,250
to be able to type in something like

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,919
electronic vehicle and then also see

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:35,029
results for Tesla we expect to be able

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,620
to make a typo or a mistake and for the

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,490
search engine to automatically kind of

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,990
assume what we were looking for we also

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,849
assume that the website will make

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,540
prioritized rankings and weightings

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:50,959
based on what is generally most looked

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,060
after and in that case basic search from

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,740
WordPress just doesn't really cut it in

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,050
that regard anymore you know so a lot of

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,500
people back in a day moved over to

00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,720
elastic

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,450
search when I had a larger website and

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,520
then from there all the learnings that

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,350
happen in an elastic search were then

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,330
you know productizing companies like

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,040
algo lia where you just connect your

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,810
WordPress site and also you have you

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,030
know search which is I'd say a lot

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,670
smarter or intelligent than the default

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,280
search and search in that regard is not

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,190
a core competency of WordPress

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,370
another example is conversation right we

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:31,760
have WordPress comments comments have

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,860
become a lot more elaborate than they

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,670
used to be and comments in some way are

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,960
this this extension of guest books did

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,440
anybody ever have a guest book on their

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,770
website I did yeah cool it's like three

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,030
people we should bring guest books back

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:51,530
but conversation nowadays again is

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,590
hitting this wall because we have

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,750
discussed we have live fire we have you

00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,270
know WordPress comments and none of them

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,520
are really being none of them are really

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,410
able to hit that next level of

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,510
conversation and engagement you know

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,090
I've been using discussed for a while

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,510
but I'm already sensing like where is

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,730
this going

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,920
you know I'm happy that there's you know

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,290
that there's automated moderation I'm

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,240
happy that there's there's there's new

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,710
ways of commenting like inline

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,470
commenting which might you know come to

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,270
Guttenberg this or an extent but a lot

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,040
of these things generally don't long

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,620
inside of WordPress because they again

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,200
need intelligent systems around them in

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,580
terms of social logins in terms of

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,290
moderation and things like that

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,700
I know noteworthy one here is the coral

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,760
project if I have mentioned it from

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,490
Mozilla analytics again

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,200
who had a dashboard inside their

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,330
WordPress site that just showed how much

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,190
traffic they were getting day to day

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,200
yeah basically like all of you that's at

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,790
some point I'm pretty sure and knows

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,090
those analytics to us you know like

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,470
number went up good number went down bad

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,720
and that's that's how simple analytics

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,030
cause but this has become so much more

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,100
complicated over time it's just not that

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,160
simple anymore you can have you can

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,140
receive little traffic from a great

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,580
audience or a lot of buyers which is

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,300
very valuable or you can get a lot of

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,180
traffic

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,520
a lot of people who are not relevant so

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,650
again we're trying to figure out through

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,720
lots of different tools what is the best

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,550
way to do things so we had a lot of

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
analytics plugins inside of WordPress

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,730
these are kind of dying because they're

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,120
being replaced with Google Analytics

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:31,270
integrations they're being replaced with

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,940
hot jar decibel integrations

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,890
god-knows-what same with email you know

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,910
my first small business customers that I

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:43,520
had in 2010 2011 I'd set up their

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,820
newsletter inside of WordPress it didn't

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,350
mean that I was sending automatically

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,880
blog posts every week or something like

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,560
that that were being published it was a

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,130
separate newsletter tool inside

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,530
WordPress and if we were sending out

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,270
1,000 or 2,000 people the emails would

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,950
send out every two or three seconds

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,050
right like goes on the cron job just

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,200
kind of running like that and again here

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,570
we see that you know these kind of tools

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,890
are living somewhere else now like

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,110
MailChimp SendGrid

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,400
campaign monitor because they're

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,020
intelligent because they have lots of

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,250
data because they're able to say hey you

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,090
know this person's in this geographic

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,130
region based on past behavior they will

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,540
be online around these hours so for that

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,430
particular person we'll send at that

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,140
time that's just not something that you

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,790
know we can figure out for our own

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,760
little site so the growing ecosystem is

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,080
is an important one I think you you're

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,240
sort of understanding the point I'm

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,270
trying to make in that there's a lot of

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,970
core features or larger plugins inside

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,160
of WordPress that are now you know

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,080
slowly moving outside of WordPress and

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,960
becoming part of sass solutions or

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,410
third-party solutions the nice thing

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,420
about that for for the economy or for

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,880
organizations for clients for businesses

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,520
for whoever is that a lot of these

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,870
solutions are very user friendly right

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,090
there they're there for non-technical

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,190
people so a client doesn't have to come

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,270
to you and say hey I need to send a

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:13,070
newsletter or you know I like to tweak

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,260
the search weightings or something like

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,520
that day as a business power user can go

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,520
in and law and do that themselves

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,100
and last but not least we're seeing a

00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,069
lot of these different solutions really

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,610
focus on actual business value so if we

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:33,420
look at the a few of these examples

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:34,889
discuss says-- express yourself hot jar

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,639
essay is the fast and visual way to

00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:41,220
understand your users and MailChimp says

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,420
put your people front and center none of

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,179
them actually talk about the solution

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,949
they just talk about people you know

00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,019
this is this is the the new game in

00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:51,059
terms of trying to focus on the actual

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:55,470
outcomes as opposed to the technical

00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:58,050
implementations so along with the

00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,670
replacement of these these core features

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,790
that we're seeing or these you know

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,100
larger plugins that used to exist we're

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,589
also seeing you know the the entrance or

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,929
emergence of completely new technologies

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:13,350
as if the the web wasn't complicated

00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:16,230
enough so technologies like artificial

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,910
intelligence machine learning or the

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,499
latest JavaScript framework I'm sure

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,089
like three new frameworks came out this

00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,579
morning that we haven't even heard of

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,309
yet they're all very exciting they're

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:29,279
all here to stay but they do come with a

00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:32,790
lot of implementation challenges and I

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,220
wanted to well I mean this kind of sums

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,660
up a lot of what we tend to see nowadays

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,279
there's a lot of hype around things like

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,049
artificial intelligence and machine

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,549
learning but at the end of the day when

00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:48,660
it's actually implemented it's a lot

00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:52,319
simpler and it's a lot more I don't know

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,049
a lot more human in that regard there's

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,759
no big machine running around but

00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,309
nonetheless there's a couple examples I

00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:04,410
wanted to run through for you guys

00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:07,019
I guess all of you know said was yes ok

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:10,439
good so weird a WordPress partner for

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:14,220
Red Bull media house in Salzburg and

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:16,379
they've now gone with Gutenberg across

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,220
multiple properties so how many of you

00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,150
ever have already started using

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,360
Gutenberg

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,010
yeah very cool that's great it's it's a

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,890
daunting task and it's really cool but

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,470
it's yeah it's really amazing and you

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,670
know in cases like this with redbull and

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,110
service like these are large

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,390
organizations that are trying to do

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,520
they're trying to centralize things and

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,490
are trying to think more in terms of

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,440
blocks rather than pages right the

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,540
concept of pages to a certain extent is

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,910
even becoming outdated that's the the

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,560
kind of time we live in contents lives

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,900
in fragments and is then distributed

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,880
through various channels it's kind of a

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,400
scary thought but that's that's the new

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,230
world we live in and in this case you

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,240
know Gutenberg is scaled across multiple

00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,650
different properties so the same block

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,480
and have different styling on different

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:04,930
pages but essentially we use the same

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,839
custom block another example is

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,310
TechCrunch which we helped rebuild from

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,100
scratch so the TechCrunch that you see

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,350
online today is completely headless

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,510
which means that it has WordPress on the

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,800
backend and then users react on the

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,430
front-end how many people have used

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,180
react or view or angular okay fair few

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:27,279
Wow cool so you'll know like you know

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,000
this is it's great technology we talk

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,709
about it a lot you see it a lot in in

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,790
you know web design news and conferences

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,440
and things like that but there's a lot

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,089
of implementation challenges you know

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,910
like I'm rebuilding my own personal

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,550
website and reacting them I'm wondering

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,470
why why I started down this path now

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,770
because there's there's not much value

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,570
on a very personal level to go down that

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,930
path but for large organizations there

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,580
certainly is in the case of TechCrunch

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,410
there's there's no more page switching

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,330
so you don't click on the link and then

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,120
you know have a blank page that loads up

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,430
you just seamlessly transition from one

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,550
page and tune in to the next and for

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,679
them that's increased engagement by the

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,079
upper sort of double digits in terms of

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,560
percentage which is quite an impact for

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,569
a business that has this much traffic

00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,480
[Music]

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,520
and lastly lastly I want to talk about

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,850
or an example I want to provide was

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,970
Siemens so we've we've been working with

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,160
Siemens and in this case we've ripped

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,990
out Guttenberg from the back end and

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,670
we've put it on the front end and then

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,870
we've connected connected it to a bunch

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:40,080
of artificial intelligence api's which

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,580
is quite fun but that is really like the

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,920
forefront you know and in a case like

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,120
this what it's doing is it's doing

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,860
simple things like checking for

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,130
grammatical mistakes and then making

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:53,850
suggestions but it's also helping find

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,920
more SEO friendly synonyms you know so

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,620
if you have something like digital city

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,330
it might say hey smarter City is a term

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,450
that's more looked for maybe consider

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,040
using this instead and even makes

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,470
headline suggestions in that regard so

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,880
it's even engaging not only in natural

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,510
language processing but then also

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,280
natural language generation and this

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,810
happens all the way to the hashtag

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,610
recommendations

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,910
it makes based on trends that are

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,920
happening more or less in real time so

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,960
in this case you can see the header in

00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,480
the back which is how can digitalization

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,480
relieve pressure on cities and the first

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,200
hashtag recommendation is Expo 2020

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,750
Dubai which is pretty much the you know

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,660
a perfect fit in terms of hashtags you

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:43,200
use and that's all coming from places

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,880
such as Twitter medium com reddit that's

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,490
how the headlines are being generated or

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,860
how to sample is being created that's

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,440
how data and topics are being brought

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,470
together it's quite advanced you know

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,960
and this is this is a tool that you know

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,970
for an industrial company or a history

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,590
of being very industrial it's quite

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,890
ambitious in that regard you know these

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:09,090
do these sort of initiatives so this is

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,340
the interesting thing about a lot of

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,650
this and you know before I talked about

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,630
how some wordpress features are being

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,200
replaced by third parties but at the

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,450
same time we're also seeing you know

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,750
does this increase in what WordPress is

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,510
truly known for which is content and you

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,610
know publishing online I

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,960
to focus it's not necessarily having a

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,610
search functionality it's not

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,680
necessarily you know having a templating

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,740
engine necessarily you know publishing

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,020
online and and the sort of core of

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,210
actually creating content it's probably

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,210
the the biggest sort of focus point of

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,910
WordPress which is why Gutenberg is such

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,460
a massive project right Gutenberg alone

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,880
has had more commits in the last year

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,430
than Drupal has as a whole project which

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,560
is crazy Gutenberg in that in that sense

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,320
is its own application it's its own sort

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,600
of project and it's it is very heavy

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,990
because of the user experience that's

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,250
required to elevate something like that

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:15,290
to a standard that helps all of us

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:18,520
actually feel like it's a tool that's we

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:21,860
can put in front of users and

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,960
technologies in that regard tried you

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,570
know like it makes more sense to try and

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,300
do one thing well as opposed to many

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,090
things poorly and WordPress was great in

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,680
that regard ten years ago it was you

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,150
know let's let's try to do everything

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,010
because none of these tools are

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,410
available so let's use all the plugins

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,330
and create everything on WordPress and

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,850
now that a lot of these best ideas these

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,440
these best sort of lessons learned have

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,510
come out and have been built into SAS

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,030
solutions there's not necessarily a

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,610
massive need for that to all occur

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,910
inside of WordPress so being able to to

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:59,450
be part of this this larger ecosystem is

00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,960
so important nowadays and it's it is a

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,610
real thing

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,320
you know like I for a lot of years was

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,750
more or less stuck inside this kind of

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,400
WordPress bubble in terms of hey you

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,230
know like I always use plugins always do

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,140
this and not at some point you know you

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,820
you realize hey to be able to compete we

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,250
really have to use the best of both

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,550
worlds and in all the cases I mentioned

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:22,910
before you know in a case of Red Bull

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,830
it's it's mixing Gutenberg with Red

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,950
Bulls incredible sort of video power so

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,300
their own api's and and their way of

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,700
doing things in their technology behind

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,490
that that's proprietary in the case of

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,650
TechCrunch that's mixing WordPress with

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:40,220
react in the case of Siemens that's

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,750
mixing Gutenberg and AI and by a

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,879
combining these different technologies

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,740
you often unlock these sort of new

00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:49,669
sources of value for businesses and as

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,009
I've mentioned before like

00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,450
implementation is a big challenge so we

00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,950
might see a lot of hype around AI

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,860
machine learning and all these things

00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,590
but what you're seeing here is is you

00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,039
know I'd say it's part of forefront of

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,120
these kind of projects mostly because

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
there's a big difference between what

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,500
you can build as a proof of concept and

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,690
you know as build in terms of theory and

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:17,659
as a demo and what you can actually put

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:18,799
into production for many many users so I

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,730
feel like we've been talking a lot about

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,570
you know fragmentation and

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,549
specialization in that regard but it's

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,419
also important to consider how our own

00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:31,639
roles play into it so ten years ago I

00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:33,980
feel like anybody could have been mildly

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:36,169
successful if they just put the hours

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,629
into being a web designer it didn't

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:39,830
really matter you know the skill didn't

00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:41,899
matter all too much and I guess that's

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,139
also because just getting a website out

00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:46,879
there was the the biggest goal and I

00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:49,909
certainly you know describe myself back

00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:51,139
then as as a web designer but you know

00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:54,470
does anybody still describe themselves

00:22:51,139 --> 00:23:01,429
as a web designer today in this room on

00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:03,379
the actual LinkedIn profile no exactly

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,210
so that's I guess the part of the point

00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,220
but you know like I've I certainly do

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,389
some certain sometimes meet people who

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,090
you know still have the web designer

00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:13,190
title and generally they're a sole

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,059
proprietor so they said he worked alone

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,889
so their SAP standing and they you know

00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,769
probably work with small to medium sized

00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:23,269
businesses and lastly they're probably

00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:26,019
coming at this more from the marketing

00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:28,549
angle than the development angle and

00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:32,600
this is also you know reflected when we

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,429
again look at Google Trends it's kind of

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,289
crazy when you look at it now that web

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,720
designer as a term has come all the way

00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,049
down to the point that it's matching in

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,120
terms of popularity with UX designer I

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,470
mean 10 15 years ago when you said UX

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,309
designer no one was ready to pay any

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,799
money for that and here we are it's kind

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:53,179
of crazy the funny one too is a product

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,840
designer because you see it was a bit

00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,520
more popular in

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,010
2004 but then I had a dip and kind of

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,169
came back I do wonder if-if and this is

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,360
kind of reaching but I do wonder if a

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:04,909
product designer back then was more

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,529
about physical objects and then that

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,909
sort of died down with the advance of

00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,130
the Internet and that has kind of come

00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:12,860
back with product development online and

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,120
product design so it's it's very

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,090
interesting to see how these you know

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,669
titles are being broken down but again

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,620
you know like here we're seeing these

00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:24,860
these challenges also in the WordPress

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:28,159
space so if you're in WordPress today

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,890
and you build websites for customers

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,860
chances are you'll have to specialize

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,440
more in the future you'll have to decide

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,059
on the path so to speak some people go

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,770
more into development so that could be

00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:42,200
you know JavaScript the front-end

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,330
frameworks like react you on on the

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,909
development side and I building API is

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,200
graph QL whatever or on the other side

00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:49,789
you could be on the product and

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,860
marketing side you can say hey you know

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,630
like I'm someone who's who's bringing

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,730
all these different tools together to

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,880
drive the actual you know business

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,020
outcome or values that we're looking for

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,510
what is the business trying to achieve

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,399
and that's where I'm going to push for

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:07,130
but I I generally feel like that one

00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:11,870
person in the middle will slowly you

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:14,149
know cease to exist in that regard so

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,580
where does that all leave us in the end

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:18,590
well if we come back to the beginning

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,630
where I talked about the purpose of many

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,929
websites back then in terms of just

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,220
simply being there to exist then I think

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:27,110
that we have to understand and gain an

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,299
appreciation for a purpose we serve

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,520
today you know do we develop for the

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,950
sake of developing do we design just a

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,169
design we build websites just so that

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,029
there's a website online or these all

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:43,279
like zero to one switches of course not

00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:46,340
building a website today is is implicit

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,919
right it's a commodity anybody can do so

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,140
by going on on Wix or a Squarespace to

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,960
build a website that's not hard the

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,330
focus in today in that regard is still

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,399
all over the place though right

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,370
many web sites exist but they don't

00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:03,140
deliver results many websites have

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,169
analytics but they don't really have

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,549
meaningful insights coming out of them

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:11,899
many websites do a beat

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:13,220
but nothing changes as a result and my

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:15,289
favorite is you know many companies

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,269
decide to do a full redesign but never

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,309
look at past data or lessons learned to

00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,549
this determine what's the new thing is

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:26,259
that they're gonna build so in this day

00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:28,580
and age as digital becomes part of

00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:31,639
everyone's lives results and outcomes

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,600
are becoming or are being talked about a

00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:36,919
lot more and this will become

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,129
increasingly important as we go into a

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:45,340
new decade and this also shapes you know

00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:45,340
how you and I use and perceive WordPress

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:51,019
so most of the conversations I have with

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:53,659
clients nowadays you know revolve around

00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:57,559
these sort of topics but not necessarily

00:26:53,659 --> 00:27:00,109
about design or development or you know

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,350
a particular sort of tactical strategy

00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:05,899
there's there's there's a digital has

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,309
permeated in all our lives it's it's

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:11,899
part of all our roles it's part of our

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:13,909
jobs so there's this real hunger or sort

00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:16,249
of truth seeking for what is actually

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:18,679
driving results from my website you know

00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:20,749
what is what is the what is the outcome

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,409
for my brand and in terms of long term

00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:26,299
strategy how am I actually getting there

00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,809
so you know as you move forward with

00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:30,739
this year

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,749
ask yourself how WordPress and you know

00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:35,840
other tools ideas and experiments

00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:39,080
together help drive real value for the

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,149
projects you work on and today is packed

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,649

sessions right after this there's

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:53,539
there's a session on SAS there's a

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:55,549
session on subscriber models there's all

00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,499
the basics in terms of SEO content

00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:00,950
strategy and so on and so on so it is

00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:03,049
really a great sort of diversity of

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,629
sessions today that helps try to push

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,690
you forward so I hope you'll learn a lot

00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:11,149
from it and more importantly meet a lot

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,540
of new people and in that regard thank

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,020
you

00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,240
[Music]

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,740
[Applause]

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,740
[Music]

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,030
so we also kept a couple of minutes for

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,010
questions or anybody has any crazy raise

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,910
your hand and somebody would come with a

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:32,050
microphone to you

00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:38,110
and if not we're going to switch turn

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:40,900
okay just seconds hello thank you for

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,150
the talk could you please go a little

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,970
bit deeper into the question of pages

00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,880
are obsolete and we now have to start to

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,620
think in blocks of content yeah for sure

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,950
that's a great question so just to

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,870
reiterate um this is about pages

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,810
becoming somewhat obsolete

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,780
I think right now they're not like

00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,960
obviously pages exist they have a very

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,840
important role in terms of SEO because

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,560
there's a link in terms of content being

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,180
archived to a certain address on the web

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,190
the concept I'm talking about is is

00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,350
probably more on the back end so you'll

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,270
always have a page that is generated on

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:23,590
the front end but when you look at

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:26,290
marketing nowadays with the advance of

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,420
AI machine learning marketing is trying

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,090
to pursue personalization right so you

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,140
go on a website or use Spotify or some

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,940
you know most of you probably use

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,620
Spotify to some extent you have discover

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,080
weekly you have other playlists that are

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,360
made for you in that same way pages are

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,830
being made for you right so they take

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,690
content from different places and say

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,200
hey based on his behavior or her

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,870
behavior

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,600
you know whoever's behavior this this is

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,700
the content we're gonna show this person

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,770
and that is the aggregation of blocks

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,290
which then make up the page so you're

00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,700
not designing a page necessarily but

00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,200
you're designing the content and you're

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,590
having a content architecture and

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,450
strategy around fragments or blocks of

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,520
content that are not only delivered

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,110
through an API to let's say like a web

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,240
front-end but they might also go to a

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,240
watch they might go to a phone they

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,860
might go to voice who knows what so

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,200
there's that's that's the the sort of

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,770
fragmentation in terms of we're not

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,260
necessarily starting with hey I need you

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,610
know six pages for my website you know

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,770
in the future that's that's the

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,050
difference I'm talking about

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,830
where it's much more content-driven does

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:33,210
that answer your question

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:36,210
cool okay any more questions we've got a

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:39,180
couple more minutes all right then

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,280
a +4 note I think you'll be able to find

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,150
him around yeah after this session go

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,260
somewhere the hip thanks so much

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,390
[Applause]

00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,390
