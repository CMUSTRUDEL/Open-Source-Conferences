[Music]

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,200
that was a really you know turning it on

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,270
is always helpful so um my name is

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,070
Tiffany I'll be the room host for this

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,840
morning um before lunch and we just have

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,540
a few announcements to start out with

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,040
before we introduce the speakers oh the

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,660
first thing is um if everyone could

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,950
please silence their cell phones and

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,580
anything else that might make noise

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,880
during the presentations and also if you

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,740
can move to the center or make room for

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,660
people to come in who are coming in late

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,370
even just raise your hand if there's an

00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,790
empty space right now we have plenty of

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,920
space if anyone has any accessibility

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,350
needs that they need help with please

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,350
approach any of us as volunteers and

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,120
we'll be happy to help after the session

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,390
there will after each session we'll have

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,480
a Q&A and microphones will be passed

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:52,870
around so if you can speak into the mic

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,430
it will help for recordings and if you

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,710
could hold the questions until the end

00:28:54,430 --> 00:29:00,130
of the session there will be time to

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,470
answer those also just a reminder that

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:06,630
there is a contributor day on Sunday and

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:10,120
we'd love to have all of you come and

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,380
and then I think we'll just go ahead and

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,070
introduce our first speaker

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,730
Naomi Bush she's presenting on working

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,110
with WordPress and external api's

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,930
Naomi's been working with WordPress as a

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,000
professional developer since 2005 and

00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,130
you can currently find her over at

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,020
gravity plus Pro where she specializes

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,400
in using WordPress form builders to

00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,860
quickly deliver custom business

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,900
functionality at a fraction of the cost

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,370
she contributes back to the WordPress

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,760
project through the core code

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,760
documentation free plugins organizing

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,730

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,960
[Applause]

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:06,169
good morning good morning there we go

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:22,669
all right I think we need to turn this

00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:27,100
off there we go all right okay so I see

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:27,100
we still have some some feedback here

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:37,820
all right excuse me

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:39,110
okay thank you all right all right so I

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,630
am indeed

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,030
Naomi C Bush and I will be your

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,610
facilitator for this morning's story

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:50,540
time all right

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:54,740
so as I mentioned I do work with with

00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:57,890
external api's basically connecting

00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,929
WordPress with the outside world helping

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,790
businesses make sure that their data can

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:05,720
get to and from their systems and that

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:10,070
they don't have any silos specifically

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,799
my company gravity plus I build external

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,540
integrations for a little form builder

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,080
you may have heard of called gravity

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,030
forms all right all right so since the

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,549
connection is always coming from

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,260
WordPress that's how I like to think

00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,390
about it the connection comes from

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,410
WordPress then the first thing that I

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,480
always do is I make sure that I am

00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:36,080
making my H I'm sorry making my API

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,970
calls through the WordPress HTTP API is

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,679
there anyone here that is not familiar

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:44,780
with the HTTP API anyone okay

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,450
don't be afraid you can raise your hand

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,900
I really can't see much okay there we go

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:54,230
all right so basically the WordPress

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,929
HTTP API is a way for you to make X

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,450
ternal api calls what it does is it

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:03,110
takes your data it does a little

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,390
validation some formatting and it will

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,600
send the request it will choose the

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:12,020
correct transport method based on the

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,230
server that the code resides on so there

00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,910
are multiple ways to send a request and

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,919
HTH excuse me

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:22,549
there are multiple ways to send a

00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,250
request in PHP the wordpress api will

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:28,070
choose the correct method and then when

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,350
it gets the response back it will do it

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,510
will do some light formatting ok so

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:36,559
that's that's basically it it's a

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:40,070
wrapper around sending API calls so I

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,500
make sure that all of my API calls use

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,660
that API a lot of people when they're

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,980
working with external API is they will

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:51,169
go and just grab you know if the API has

00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,540
a PHP library they'll go and grab that

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,340
and make the calls directly through that

00:32:53,540 --> 00:33:02,570
but I'll get into a little bit about why

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:04,820
I don't do that ok alright ok and also

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,280
if you are building integrations for

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,809
public consumption that is absolutely

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,820
the best way to go

00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:13,850
again because that code is going to be

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,090
residing on many different servers that

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:21,679
you do not have control over ok all

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:24,190
right so stripe stripe was my very first

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,320
teacher alright almost eight years ago

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,780
that is where I cut my teeth that is

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,090
where I learned a lot of my lessons and

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,309
I am still learning lessons through

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,290
strike and it's almost like who would

00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:39,110
have thunk it because stripe was just so

00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,270
simple alright if anyone here has worked

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,549
for stripe you remember stripe from the

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:46,220
from the very beginning beautiful

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:47,870
beautiful beautiful API alright that's

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,640
how it started out I mean it was it was

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:54,320
a developer's dream that particular API

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,700
caused me to say you know what life is

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,480
too short to work with difficult api's

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:05,750
ok so back when I was doing client work

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,760
there was an organization that used

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,220
WordPress and that's how they process

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,970
their membership dues every year ok so

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,290
we were using PayPal at that time and we

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,609
were looking for something a little less

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,840
error-prone

00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:22,970
ok at that time and so I'd heard about

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,940
this new payment solution called stripe

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,080
I checked it out it was for developers I

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,250
said wow this is great

00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,050
we're gonna use this it looks great so

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,909
we were using gravity forms and I

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,950
contacted the makers of gravity forms

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,720
rocket genius you might be familiar with

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,119
them and I said hey will you build this

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:47,929
integration for us and their response

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:51,440
was oh yeah maybe at some point not at

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,149
this time and so I'm like well I kind of

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,300
need this so what did I do

00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:58,850
and anybody guess what did I do there

00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,410
you go I wrote it myself you know I just

00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:05,990
said ok

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:09,020
and so the stripe API like I said at

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:11,600
that time was beautiful life was good

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:17,210
right I mean the documentation it was

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:20,810
just simple beautiful easy to read for

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,760
one they also use their own API and what

00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,770
you find is that when a developer uses

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,020
their own stuff it tends to be a little

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,820
bit better ok so everything that they

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:33,080
had built was built on top of their own

00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:36,890
API they had a PHP library right which

00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,930
was perfect API documentation very clear

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,400
very easy to read alright so those are

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,160
kind of hitting some of those spots that

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,960
you're looking for they also and this

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,540
was the plus right they who here

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,550
remembers campfire he might hear you

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,109
so they had a developer campfire where

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,060
all of their developers would hang out

00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:55,520
all right and answer questions and

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,170
that's how I got it got the chance to to

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,450
meet some of them and I ended up

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,240
actually working for stripe for a little

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:06,530
bit and so life was good all right

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:11,030
life was good and then right of course I

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:14,570
ran into my first issue excuse me you

00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,910
guys are not seeing any slides there we

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:21,230
go all right

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,790
all right so ran into my first issue so

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,710
what happened was they became popular

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,140
all right and as more and more people

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,130
started building integrations for

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,490
WordPress what do you think happened

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,440
let's see

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,440
can anybody anybody guess what happened

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:43,280
okay so if we're all using the same PHP

00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,260
library alright we're just pulling it in

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,340
from stripe using that PHP library then

00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,900
we're gonna have collisions right

00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,840
because it wasn't namespaced

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,490
at that time all right so my plugin here

00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,230
it is it's been sailing it's been

00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,360
working for so long and then all of a

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,700
sudden I get these supporting emails

00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,150
saying that your plug-in is causing my

00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:08,060
site to a fatal error and I'm like what

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,860
and I'm looking and I'm like okay and so

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,050
that's when you start you know looking

00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,210
at the environment and what do I see I

00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,670
see other stripe plugins and we're all

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,080
just pulling in the same library all

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,690
right and so whoever gets there first

00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,580
all right they get priority and then if

00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,450
my plugin is being loaded second well

00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,090
there it is

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,740
fatal error because of Naomi's plugin

00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,590
all right and it's the other way around

00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:33,560
if if theirs is loaded after mine all

00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:36,500
right and so you may say okay that is

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,420
very simple to fix all right you'll just

00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,800
check and see if the library already

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:46,010
exists right can anybody tell me why

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,350
that did not work there you go

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:52,040
versioning all right so a lot of people

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,480
at that time they weren't updating they

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,190
weren't updating the stripe library

00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,810
right they weren't even up it was just

00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,820
an add-on you know to whatever other

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:01,370
product that they had so they weren't

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:04,490
keeping it updated so if I simply

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,830
checked for you know to see whether that

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,630
library already existed well if they

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,640
were on an older version of the library

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,620
and the features in my plugin we're

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,160
using a newer version well then we would

00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:18,020
get in error all right so I simply

00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,900
namespaced it okay and so that's

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,140
something that I I still do with a lot

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,630
of the API libraries that I work with I

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,450
have to go in and namespace them and

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,830
sometimes I'll do it even you know just

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,570
to make sure

00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,060
that in the future if someone else is

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:40,580
building something you know that there

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:43,640
are no no collisions there okay so the

00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:46,370
next issue that that I ran into was

00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,070
stripe actually stopped updating their

00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:52,540
PHP library right so they had all these

00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:55,640
newer features in their API and then I

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,980
wasn't able to use them in their library

00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,140
right so I would have to create you know

00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:04,130
my own custom functions there of course

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,570
using the HTTP API alright and this is

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,690
actually something that you will run

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:12,010
into frequently enough okay in my next

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:15,050
case study I'm going to show you exactly

00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,630
exactly how I ran into that again all

00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,910
right so there's nothing like beating

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,620
yourself in the head over an error you

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,900
know when you're like what what is going

00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,280
on here and you come to find out that

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,940
the library just hasn't been updated

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,110
okay all right so now whenever I'm

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,950
working with an API

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:36,770
I always check to make sure that you

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,940
know it covers the latest API calls you

00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,310
know I'm looking at the commit history

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,670
seeing if it's updated looking at the

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:45,470
bugs the issues on github to see you

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,590
know our people reporting bugs and

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:54,140
they're not being merged in things like

00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:56,300
that all right so the good news is just

00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,610
to clear their name after about a couple

00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,740
of years they did put a dedicated

00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:04,130
resource on that and they do keep that

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:06,800
that library updated okay so as I

00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,570
started building more and more stripe

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,250
integrations for other platforms

00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,470
I found myself writing the same code

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,210
over and over and over again all right

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,370
so I wanted a way to standardize that

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,860
and so I ended up building my first

00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,190
middleware okay anybody here not

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:24,260
familiar with that terminology

00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:27,350
middleware okay it's basically just a

00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,320
wrapper around around the API calls and

00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:32,480
again I'm basically taking their API

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,570
calls and I'm running them through the

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,690
WordPress HTTP API but something

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,450
actually happened is that it this was

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,210
actually a surprisingly educational

00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:46,640
exercise that I learned help deepen my

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,920
understanding of the API alright so I

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,869
kind of stumbled upon that and now it's

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,060
something that I do for every API that I

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:55,190
encounter the first thing I do is I

00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,770
start out by writing middleware why

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:01,190
because it makes me intimately familiar

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:05,150
with the calls the parameters and the

00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:06,339
responses ok so then when you know when

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,690
I'm writing the integration between

00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,570
WordPress or gravity forms then I

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:14,960
already understand what what my calls

00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,490
and my responses will be ok

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,190
it's kind of like in computer science

00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,170
school anybody here had to exercise to

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,359
write a compiler in order to understand

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,430
you know how things work

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,260
anybody know nobody else where the

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,220
compiler okay yeah all right

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,990
so here was the next thing that I

00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:39,680
learned I also learned that these api's

00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:44,030
guess what they can have bugs I mean to

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,990
think developers make mistakes you know

00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:50,540
so ran into a bug with the API alright

00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,010
and once I found that out that was

00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,349
actually a little bit dangerous for me

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,119
all right because then I stopped testing

00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:57,770
my points of failure and I'm like oh

00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,780
this isn't working you're right you must

00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,580
be a bug with the API and I report a bug

00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,920
and they're like no it's working fine

00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:07,210
for us so that was a good reminder for

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,250
me to always test your points of failure

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,780
okay with your API and so the first

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,339
thing that I normally do because in

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,920
WordPress there are going to be multiple

00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:18,800
points of failure all right so the first

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,410
thing I normally do is test just the API

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,930
call and the parameters no WordPress

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:27,020
nothing else just the API calling the

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,240
parameters the way that I started out

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,670
doing that was just you know basic curl

00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,740
call on the command line just to make

00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,960
sure that the API does what it says that

00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,970
it does ok because that's another thing

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,190
you'll run into is that sometimes the

00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:44,300
documentation is just it's not correct

00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:46,670
okay and so I used to just use curl on

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:50,180
now I use postman it's pretty you know

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:52,609
why not and so once I know that I've got

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,830
the API call correct and what type of

00:42:52,609 --> 00:43:00,210
response I'm looking for that's when I

00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:01,740
move to WordPress okay and it's funny

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,080
because that's actually the biggest

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,380
weakness that I see and a lot of the API

00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,780
documentation is responses okay I'll

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,420
tell you this do not trust the responses

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,970
and the API documentation many times

00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,670
they are just wrong apparently it's very

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,400
difficult to keep up with and to keep

00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,280
updated in the documentation responses I

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,130
don't know why but all right so then I

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,100
said I'm sorry so then I test the API

00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:33,240
call in in WordPress so remember I said

00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:36,000
that I use the HTTP API and the HTTP API

00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,970
will do some validation and some

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,390
formatting okay and that is another

00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,680
instance where I have beat myself in the

00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,260
head all right

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,840
over what is going on I know this API

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,660
call is correct what is happening and it

00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,370
will be something you know it will be

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,770
something that WordPress is doing some

00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,990
formatting that I need to that I need to

00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:01,050
adjust for okay something that they're

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:03,710
that they're formatting there I actually

00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:07,740
recently had an issue with stripe where

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:10,200
one of my API calls specific API calls

00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,660
for a stripe connect was being rejected

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,640
and a customer actually found this it

00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,140
was only that API call for stripe

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,910
connect and we're like what is going on

00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,490
and it was because of the WordPress

00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,520
header all right so the default header

00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:25,980
that the HTTP API sends I think it says

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,620
like WordPress slash you know whatever

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,570
the version is something that stripe was

00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:34,080
doing on their side they were rejecting

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:36,780
the call and the error message was you

00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,450
know unintuitive you know didn't explain

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,880
that so that is something to look out

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,020
for and that's why I always test the API

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,650
call first

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:51,230
outside of WordPress and then and then I

00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:53,580
test in WordPress with with the API okay

00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:58,250
another thing that I learned with stripe

00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,250
is that services that use their own API

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,180
going through their dashboard all right

00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,500
with the inspector on can actually be a

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,150
great way to find undocumented features

00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,720
okay a lot of times you'll find with

00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,010
these

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,140
guys is that searching is one thing that

00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:17,609
you know they're they're vague on if you

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,990
look at their documentation they won't

00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,420
tell you all of the search parameters

00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,580
and you'll be looking to search on one

00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,410
specific thing and you're like gosh you

00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,050
have to be able to search by email

00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,090
you know just simple things and so if

00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,830
you look at their dashboard and you look

00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,440
at the inspector you'll actually find a

00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:37,109
lot of undocumented things in there and

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:41,790
there are some that I still use years

00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:44,580
years later and you know I love it okay

00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:48,050
so if you notice in the beginning I said

00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:51,599
that strike was simple

00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:55,380
all right well over the years that has

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:59,280
changed we are in the dark ages

00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,230
all right of stripe basically you know

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,720
they've added so many more features

00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:07,890
things are not as simple the payments

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,940
the payments industry has changed

00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:15,599
basically Europe has GDP ardh payments

00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:18,390
okay and so things are things are a lot

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,250
more difficult and message all right

00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,260
that no longer exists if you're good

00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,470
enough you can build it yourself but a

00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,450
simple way is just a set a reminder set

00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:30,480
a reminder to look for changes in the

00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:35,070
API documentation another thing that you

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,730
can do is sign up for their email lists

00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,290
okay if they don't have one ask for one

00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,570
years ago I was famous for that if I

00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:44,130
went to an API they didn't have any kind

00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,839
of email list they weren't you know

00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,330
letting developers know what was going

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,550
on I would ask okay it doesn't mean

00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:53,760
you'll get it it might take some years

00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,440
to get it but eventually you know if

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,960
there's enough traction they will come

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,450
around okay and another thing that I

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,420
want to say when it comes to changes if

00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,690
there is anything that is you know

00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:09,210
backwards incompatible migrate okay

00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,640
migrate your customers and this will be

00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,440
people you know who are building these

00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,150
things for public consumption you know

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,320
if it's just your internal company you

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,820
know you may be able to get away with

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,710
that but if you're working with

00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,349
customers make sure that you migrate

00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,990
them okay it's not that hard

00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:26,170
it's

00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:28,839
that difficult honestly migration

00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,740
routines are probably one of my favorite

00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:34,330
things to build

00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:37,740
okay so migration migration migration

00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:40,540
okay that is one thing that will

00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,070
engender you much goodwill all right

00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:48,190
with those that are that are using your

00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:50,680
products okay alright so this next one

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:53,230
alright podio anybody here familiar with

00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:56,859
PO do anybody here heard of podium okay

00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:00,220
so PO do is it's significant for me

00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:03,820
because I spent a lot of my time banging

00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,650
my head with this particular API okay

00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,770
you know from the outside the

00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:10,869
documentation is deceptively simple and

00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,609
you're like oh yeah this will just work

00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:15,910
perfectly and then you get in there and

00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:18,490
you realize that the API is incorrect

00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,950
the documentation I'll say the

00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,570
documentation is incorrect and you're

00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:25,300
making these calls and you're like what

00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,710
is going on and then you just start you

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,330
know you get into that phase where you

00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,550
just start throwing things against the

00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:32,320
wall to see what will work and you

00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,830
happen upon something and you're like

00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:42,010
okay like what what is going on

00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:46,109
so with PO do PO do is the one where

00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:48,849
they're documentation as well as their

00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:51,310
PHP library was out of date

00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:53,619
okay so I had just pulled it into my

00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:56,080
project all right oh this is easy just

00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,940
pull in you know their their PHP library

00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,190
I pulled it in we're using it and then

00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,880
we're getting bugs and I'm like okay

00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:06,010
what is going on here and so I go I look

00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,920
at the github and I see that some people

00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:11,320
have reported some issues something like

00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,260
okay so I go in and I you know pull in

00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,580
the pulling the changes myself and we're

00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:22,720
going good and then lo and behold let me

00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:26,290
tell you what happened they discontinued

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,990
their PHP library how did you do that

00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:30,130
who does that

00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,920
you know it'd be different if it was

00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:35,500
some you know arcane language but PHP I

00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,220
mean come on now they discontinued their

00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,170
PHP

00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,030
I mean it had a no it has a notice on

00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,450
there on github and everything that it

00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:46,089
is discontinued and they are going to

00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:50,890
keep updating their other libraries but

00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:53,800
they are no longer servicing PHP so that

00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,660
is one of the reasons why when I was

00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,940
talking about middleware that I always

00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:01,270
recommend that you just go ahead and

00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:04,900
build your own wrappers okay not only

00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:09,310
are you are you using the internal

00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,160
WordPress API but you're also insured

00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:15,520
against people doing things like

00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:26,220
discontinuing their PHP library oh gosh

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:26,220
all right all right so Salesforce

00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:35,210
all right so Salesforce is an incredibly

00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:40,460
popular CRM who here has not heard of

00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:42,620
Salesforce no okay maybe just one or two

00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:45,940
okay all right so Salesforce is an

00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:50,060
incredibly popular CRM they are huge I

00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:51,230
like to think of them as Medusa you cut

00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,800
off one head

00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:57,260
I mean others spawn okay

00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,370
i-i've counted at least ten of what they

00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:03,140
call clouds which are their product

00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,450
divisions and I know that there are more

00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:09,500
and I'll just tell you that I found this

00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:11,510
out after I got into Salesforce so

00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,370
basically they grow by acquiring other

00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,550
companies and then they figure out later

00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,500
how they're gonna graft them in so when

00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,350
someone asks you you know do you work

00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,790
with Salesforce I say well which one

00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:26,240
right because there there are just

00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:29,690
there's so many of them and then you

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,210
have for some of them you have to API so

00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,490
you have an older SOAP API you have the

00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,440
newer REST API that you that they want

00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,900
you to transition to however their

00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,910
kicker is is that their soap API isn't

00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,220
completely transitioned to rest and so

00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:48,080
you have some calls and soap and some

00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:50,720
calls and rest right boy all right

00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,760
and then sometimes when you go in the

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,610
REST API Doc's will point you back to

00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:59,930
the soap API Docs for figuring things

00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:01,610
out so it sounds like fun right all

00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,980
right and so I would say that after this

00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:07,130
experience I came to the conclusion that

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:09,110
most API Doc's are simply mediocre okay

00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,480
live with it that's what it is

00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:14,000
most API Doc's are just going to be

00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:19,070
mediocre all right so you're going to

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,620
learn to bang your head a little bit all

00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,300
right we'll try to do it as little as

00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,210
possible but you're going to learn to

00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,670
bang your head a little bit and I'll get

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:31,880
to my last case study we'll talk about

00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:33,980
some other ways to to mitigate that all

00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,160
right so a Salesforce I've worked with

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,560
four different four different API so far

00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,440
and I expect that number to rise all

00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,440
right and each API

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,640
has a different method of authentication

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,250
has a different way of even getting

00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,100
access to the API because some products

00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:54,550
they just will not provide you access to

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,680
okay so if you know Salesforce can get

00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,450
to be very pricey okay we're talking

00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:02,200
about thousands of dollars per month and

00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:04,000
so and then even with that sometimes

00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:08,140
they will not provide you with access to

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,080
the API unless you pay even more okay so

00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:14,800
let's talk a little bit about about this

00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:17,740
so I found all of this out after I took

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,750
over the gravity forum Salesforce add-on

00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,250
alright so here it had been sitting

00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:26,110
there for about two years

00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:29,050
unmaintained and I came in I took it it

00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:31,990
was still using the old soap API I mean

00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:35,140
it was really out of date so I cleaned

00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:38,110
that up gave it a little love and now

00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:40,420
I'm a Salesforce person

00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:43,990
so the first API that I work with is

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,090
their simple web to lead okay and

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:48,040
basically that's just where they give

00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,620
you a form that you can embed on your

00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,980
site and so what I did is I just took

00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,480
the endpoint and we post the data from

00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:00,610
gravity forms to that particular

00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:03,900
endpoint however since it's not you know

00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:06,550
not any kind of you know official API

00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,460
what they have is they have a feature

00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:12,460
where something goes wrong you can get

00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:17,200
debugging emails okay which is great

00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:19,780
which is awesome except it's not because

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,630
those debugging emails provides you know

00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:26,470
useful information I mean I have gotten

00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:28,930
back emails that simply say this this

00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:32,010
lead could not be created and you know

00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:37,840
what it says in there for the reason no

00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:40,960
no so you know I try to steer people

00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:43,690
away from that API as much as possible

00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,520
from web to lead because I'm like I

00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,380
there's just no way for me to help you

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,780
if anything goes wrong all right because

00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,970
I gave no no information you know you

00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,800
can try to contact your Salesforce

00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:57,560
support person but

00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:01,400
you know they you know sometimes they're

00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,650
just not not that helpful okay so then

00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,530
the next one which I found out is their

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,750
main products okay this is after years

00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:11,210
you know when you get into Salesforce

00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:13,850
we're talking years of commitment to

00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,010
learning all right and then you still

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,050
will never ever learn everything that

00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,990
there is to know because they acquire

00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:24,320
these companies at such a rapid pace all

00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:26,480
right and so the next one is the their

00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,730
sales cloud okay

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,340
and so we're using their REST API for

00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,960
that one all right and one of the things

00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,720
that I found with Salesforce

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,570
integrations and other integrations is

00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:41,530
that some people like to use usernames

00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:44,780
and passwords for authentication okay I

00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:48,710
will recommend as much as possible do

00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,960
not use usernames and passwords okay if

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:55,130
they have it available always use OAuth

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,990
okay always use OAuth it's much more

00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,050
secure all right because they are

00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:02,750
connecting directly to to an application

00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:05,180
on their account they can revoke those

00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:09,950
things there are tokens and keys that

00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:11,300
will refresh okay so you know so that

00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,870
you're not storing usernames and

00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:16,880
passwords in WordPress okay all right

00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:19,820
and so then the third product that I

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,310
work with for Salesforce is marketing

00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,290
cloud and how I found out about this one

00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:26,090
was through a customer so a customer

00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:27,890
came in and said hey you know does this

00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:32,120
integrate with marketing cloud and I'm

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:34,070
like well does it have a REST API yeah I

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,980
think so and so I go and look it up and

00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:40,910
I find out that the marketing cloud API

00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:43,850
is different than the sales cloud API so

00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,920
no we did not integrate with marketing

00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:48,740
cloud at that time it was completely

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,270
different and that was one of the

00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,940
solutions that they are really really

00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:56,060
tight on giving people access to there

00:56:52,940 --> 00:57:00,200
are no sand boxes you know so you can

00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,160
only test with the actual data okay and

00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:07,350
then the fourth one is

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:10,650
the Salesforce part dot if anybody

00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:12,750
remembers par dot it was another

00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:15,180
acquisition of Salesforce it was just

00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:19,380
part out and so now it's Salesforce par

00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,010
dot and you know their API is completely

00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,720
different

00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,250
alright completely different website

00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,260
completely different set of

00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:30,210
documentation completely different way

00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:32,250
of authenticating ok so that's what

00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:36,920
we've done with Salesforce Salesforce

00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,920
has taught me a lot a lot a lot a lot

00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:48,980
alright so the next one is I had the

00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:51,240
bright idea you know I came across this

00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,130
system here it's an open source

00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,670
marketing automation system called

00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:58,770
modoch and I said oh ok open source

00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:02,520
I love open source let's integrate the

00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:04,950
two alright very bright idea except it

00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,520
wasn't ok and here's why

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:11,700
ok and by the way mark just got bought

00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:14,580
by Drupal's parent company I mean if

00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,820
anyone is its familiar with that all

00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,820
right

00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:21,660
so open source - open source PHP - PHP

00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:24,180
what could go wrong well open source -

00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:28,530
open source that's what could go wrong

00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:30,690
PHP - PHP that's what could go wrong and

00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:33,300
so what happens is when you have two

00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:36,780
open source systems that means that you

00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:39,360
basically have control of nothing okay

00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,490
and when you have control of nothing the

00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,070
number of errors and things that can go

00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,630
wrong just it's just exponentially

00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:48,150
through the roof and then when you're

00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:49,620
trying to support that that is an even

00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,200
bigger nightmare because you have to

00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:54,300
determine okay is it on the the

00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,980
WordPress side all demotic side because

00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,280
people install their own WordPress

00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,690
people also install their own modoch as

00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,420
a matter of fact more people are going

00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:06,930
to install their own modak software than

00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,720
they are WordPress and mark mark is not

00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:12,840
the most intuitive and the easiest thing

00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:15,869
to get installed and up and running okay

00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:19,829
and so if they have an issue with modoch

00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:22,049
is built on Symphony and the errors that

00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:24,779
you receive from there a lot of it is

00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:27,779
caching that's probably the biggest

00:59:24,779 --> 00:59:29,759
issue that I see with Manik is caching

00:59:27,779 --> 00:59:32,490
alright and so they're like it doesn't

00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:37,319
work your plugin sucks it's broke you

00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:41,640
know go away and then I'm like well and

00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:43,109
so moderate used to have a free tier for

00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,640
their hosting and so I would go on to

00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:46,470
host it and I would put the plug-in on

00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,230
there and I would say ok look it's

00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:51,059
working here on the host it so it must

00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,789
be something with your with your

00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:55,619
moderate install so that's something to

00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:59,690
look out for when you are integrating to

00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:02,819
open-source systems ok now here is the

00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:05,670
here was I'll say the the bright lining

01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:07,589
in that and that was because it was

01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:10,799
another open source system it allowed me

01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:12,779
the opportunity to contribute alright to

01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,910
another open source system outside of

01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:17,400
WordPress so the things that I found

01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:19,019
wrong I was able to actually fix all

01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,440
right so I was able to go in and fix the

01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:24,690
API Doc's I was able to go in and

01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,239
contribute to to any bugs that I found

01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:33,749
and so that's what that's what made it

01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:36,210
that's what made it good ok ok

01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:38,309
and so then finally after working with

01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:39,869
enough of these API is you know after

01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:40,890
you work with enough you know there's

01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,720
only you know two or three

01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,880
authentication methods that you're going

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:49,380
to run into everything else is pretty

01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:52,859
much standard for using the HTTP API you

01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,329
know there's just a standard you know

01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:56,009
standard calls that you're going to make

01:00:54,329 --> 01:01:00,390
with that the only thing that differs

01:00:56,009 --> 01:01:02,130
really is the responses and so I started

01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:04,769
writing the same code over and over

01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:07,890
again I said you know what I can kind of

01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:12,989
standardize this Here I am I'm using the

01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:15,749
gravity forms API their UI for this and

01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:18,630
as you can see people can go in choose

01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:22,410
their method their API URL so basically

01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:27,509
I just you know built in a UI around the

01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:29,550
WordPress HTTP calls ok and so basically

01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:30,960
it's just so that people

01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,880
you no longer have to wait for a

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,210
developer right to build them an

01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,670
integration just about any API they can

01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:40,140
connect through here if they don't want

01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:43,680
to they don't have to pay for zapier

01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:45,680
right so here it is right here and so

01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,430
that's another one of my recommendations

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:52,950
I get to use a lot of a lot of

01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,720
integrations I try not to fall into the

01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:56,460
developer trap you know that if I didn't

01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,060
build it you know it's no good so I try

01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,530
to use other people's solutions and some

01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,440
of them and I run into the UI is

01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:08,190
probably one of the biggest issues okay

01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,680
so I always recommend use use the built

01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:13,020
in WordPress UI as much as possible if

01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,060
you're integrating with something like a

01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:20,490
form builder or gravity forms that also

01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:23,540
provides a UI you know use that use that

01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:26,480
as well and so with this particular one

01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:29,040
so you can add your URL your

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,950
authentication method any of your

01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,530
headers and then you can use a standard

01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:36,480
format or you can you can choose your

01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:39,210
own right so there's a raw format so

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,550
it's kind of like kind of like a postman

01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:48,660
if you think about it a postman for

01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:50,010
gravity forms yeah okay all right and so

01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,770
one of the things that we did with this

01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,630
is if anybody remembers before modern

01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:58,200
tribe integrated with the WordPress REST

01:02:54,630 --> 01:03:01,290
API you know a lot of people wanted to

01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,630
be able to submit posts and things from

01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:09,780
gravity forms and so that's what we use

01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:13,890
there in order to do that all right well

01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:16,740
thank you very much I appreciate your

01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,600
time and you coming to my story time I

01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,130
hope that was helpful

01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,830
and that you got some good information

01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:25,560
and some things to watch out for when

01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:29,450
you are working with with external API

01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,450
so I think now is question time

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:47,140
[Applause]

01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:51,069
okay any questions hi excellent talk

01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:55,650
right here I'm surprising me oh there

01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:59,619
you are okay so explain the value of

01:03:55,650 --> 01:04:04,869
directly addressing an API as opposed to

01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:07,660
a plug-in um through WordPress yes okay

01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:09,910
so if you're addressing an API through

01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:12,150
WordPress it's gonna be in the context

01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:16,900
of a plugin okay

01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:19,780
so so you're talking about api's to

01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,549
plugin not other open available API

01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,809
yes so I mean if you're integrating with

01:04:21,549 --> 01:04:25,750
WordPress it's going to be in the

01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:30,250
context of you know some type of plug-in

01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:32,530
or theme but probably plug-in so you

01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:36,460
know any external integration for

01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:39,640
WordPress is always a plug-in right so

01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:41,650
are you saying can you clarify that a

01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,690
little bit can you address other api's

01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,960
that aren't plugins I guess another way

01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:49,750
to ask the question okay so if we define

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,790
API basically I'm talking about these

01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:57,609
external systems so like I mentioned

01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:59,290
Salesforce modoch Podio Marketo a lot of

01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:01,839
these other systems so they all have

01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:04,390
api's that allow you to pull the data or

01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:07,000
you know send to interact with the data

01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:08,170
in their system inside of WordPress now

01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,680
in order to do that you're going to

01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:14,770
build a plugin okay so you build your

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:18,910
plug-in to make the calls to that API

01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:21,430
and you build a plug-in to make the

01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:24,700
calls to the API and you can interact

01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:28,500
with any any service that has that has

01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,500
an API okay

01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,320
so you talked about kind of brute

01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,890
forcing your way through an API an

01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:46,680
undocumented API it's by inspecting and

01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:48,750
kind of looking at the UI of an app do

01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:51,630
you run into any situations where you're

01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,070
you're using those those things that

01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,900
you've discovered but then they

01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,190
disappear because that's that's why they

01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:02,490
weren't documented they weren't intended

01:05:56,190 --> 01:06:05,850
to be used that way yes yes I have now

01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:08,970
some of them most of them that i that i

01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:11,220
use i did get directly from from the

01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,570
developers but what you'll find is that

01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,369
if they're using it

01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:16,200
you know for example in their dashboard

01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:18,300
then it will still be there if it

01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,960
disappears i would just write in and let

01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,220
them know hey we were using this and

01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,710
sometimes they will put it back or they

01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:29,910
will tell you a different way to do it

01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:31,110
so so yeah that is one of the one of the

01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:34,140
things that you run into if it's

01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:36,630
undocumented then that gives them that

01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:39,000
gives them leeway to to pull it right

01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:41,190
but i try to try to use it as much as

01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,070
possible so that when they see that i'm

01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:49,320
using it then they think twice about

01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:50,700
pulling it over here yes sir first thank

01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,040
you for this talk as an integration

01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:56,940
developer it was incredibly refreshing

01:06:53,040 --> 01:07:01,230
to hear about the mmm aspirational

01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:05,400
documentation and responses that can

01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:09,030
come back i was curious to ask for how

01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:14,070
exactly you go about using the wordpress

01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:17,390
HTTP libraries to use a as an OAuth

01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:20,609
client last time I was doing an OAuth

01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:23,100
integration I found that most of the

01:07:20,609 --> 01:07:25,970
available libraries and frameworks out

01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:29,100
there were oriented more towards

01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:31,920
authorization rather than connecting

01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:34,920
into an API and handling the Refresh

01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:38,010
tokens and all that so I actually wound

01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:40,560
up not wanting to use the the WordPress

01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:41,880
API directly and having to implement all

01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,790
that from scratch

01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,500
I'm just curious if you have some middle

01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:50,430
infrastructure library that handles that

01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:51,750
heavy lifting sure yeah so you know I

01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,400
think I'm a little bit different than

01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,320
what I've seen I don't know if there are

01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,520
others out there but when it comes to

01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,930
OAuth I do not use a library I don't

01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,630
really understand why people think that

01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:06,390
Oh auth is so difficult to to implement

01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:09,630
and they always look for a library to

01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:11,340
use with that but you know it's I find

01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:14,550
it fairly simple after working with it

01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:19,320
so much now in terms of the WordPress

01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:23,100
HTTP API there really isn't anything in

01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:25,740
that particular API for for OAuth so

01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:28,350
with that I'm just using it to make to

01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,570
make the calls so instead of curl or

01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:33,660
something else I'll use you know WP

01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:36,660
Remote get WP Remote post or WP Remote

01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:38,310
request and that's that's that's

01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,200
basically it and then when it comes back

01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:44,750
you know you can do your WP Remote

01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:48,960
retrieve body you know retrieve response

01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:51,480
but but yeah so so off yeah I you know I

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,430
I have one that I've that I've built

01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:57,480
that I use now and it mostly works

01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:59,370
you'll find some api's that some of the

01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,350
OAuth implementations are slightly

01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:03,150
different alright so when the response

01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:04,500
comes back the parameters will be a

01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:07,110
little bit different and I actually

01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,450
found that with Salesforce so I started

01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:11,430
out with sales cloud I built you know

01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:13,230
the OAuth library in the middle that

01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:16,890
like you said handle the refresh tokens

01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:19,590
and all of that handled getting the you

01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:22,260
know getting the the authentication keys

01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:23,880
back and I said oh great you know when

01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,110
it came time to plug it into marketing

01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,030
cloud yeah I'll just plug it into

01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:29,400
marketing cloud but it was actually

01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:32,520
slightly different there was a parameter

01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:36,480
or two that were different and so what I

01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:38,490
did was I ended up kind of extracting

01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,640
that just a little bit more so that I

01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:43,530
could pass in exactly what I needed so

01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,170
that I could still use the same thing

01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:48,650
but then account for some of the

01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,650
differences

01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:56,510
more questions for you as one who writes

01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,010
API documentation and you expressed

01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:01,370
certain amount of frustration with that

01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:04,280
yes setting aside that accurate and up

01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:05,810
to date is assumed but what would you

01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,690
like to see and technical documentation

01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:12,020
on API is that maybe isn't missing or

01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:13,580
something that you found that an idea of

01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:16,489
you've had that you haven't seen out

01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:19,310
there already sure so a clear and

01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:21,730
updated list of parameters that's one of

01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:25,700
that's one of the big things and then

01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:28,520
errors right that's a big thing for me

01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:30,080
is is errors when you get an error back

01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,550
and you don't quite understand when

01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,280
something is very clear if you get this

01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:37,100
error this is what this means that

01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:40,670
that's very very helpful and eliminates

01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:44,030
the amount of head-banging time another

01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:48,500
thing is like I mentioned responses you

01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:51,400
know clear responses you know I don't

01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:54,140
know it just seems to be difficult for

01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,880
you know for people to to give clear

01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:58,970
responses these are the responses that

01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,860
you can expect this is the format of the

01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,210
response I've seen things and this is

01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,320
why I always have to do the calls

01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:08,000
outside of WordPress first because you

01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,410
know the parameters will be slightly

01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,300
different like somebody changed

01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:14,870
something and then didn't didn't update

01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:16,280
the documentation so those are those are

01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,200
the big things you know I think if you

01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,770
have those then you know it's it's

01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:25,010
smooth sailing you know what the call is

01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:28,730
you know what you know what method to

01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:32,860
you so whether it's a git or a post and

01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:35,090
even standardized excuse me standardized

01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:37,730
standardization around that would be

01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,470
great you know some calls or gates some

01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:46,930
calls or posts and it just doesn't make

01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:46,930
sense yeah so thank you

01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,170
yes good morning good morning great talk

01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:54,210
thank you thank you my question is a

01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,800
little bit higher level but um I just

01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:58,770
wanted to get your opinion on your

01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:00,540
thoughts regarding a downloadable plugin

01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:02,430
versus a hosted plugin and whether

01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:05,370
you've had experienced opportunity to

01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:08,670
actually host plugins as well and maybe

01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:10,800
it's resolved some of the you know pains

01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,570
associated with migrations or or

01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,500
versioning and things of that nature

01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:20,340
sure so so I have to say I've never

01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:24,180
really heard the hosted plug-in on

01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:26,580
terminology so if if I can clarify do

01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,200
you just mean a sass where you're

01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:33,450
hosting the functionality on your server

01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:35,160
okay so that was actually as a developer

01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:37,380
you definitely prefer that you know you

01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,970
prefer as much control as possible but

01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,130
then the customer prefers as much

01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:42,930
control as possible and so when you're

01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,870
talking about things like Salesforce

01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:48,450
where we're in the enterprise you know

01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:50,660
they want control over their data a lot

01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:54,480
of things are sensitive so the original

01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:56,370
Salesforce ad on the first versions the

01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,920
original gravity form Salesforce ad on

01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:01,950
the first versions of that actually sent

01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:04,920
all of the OAuth calls to to the

01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:06,900
author's server alright so all of the

01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:11,340
OAuth calls went to the author's server

01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:13,440
and then from there you know he took and

01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:16,050
he went and got all of the

01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,250
authentication information well what

01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,080
happened was he was no longer

01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:21,180
maintaining the plugin and there was

01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,890
failure at that server and so people

01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,260
that were connected to Salesforce they

01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:29,550
weren't able to they weren't able to

01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:31,110
authenticate properly so you know I

01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:34,890
think where it makes where it makes

01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:37,320
sense and you can get away with it you

01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:38,820
know a sass is definitely preferable you

01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,670
know hosting you know some of the

01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:44,340
difficult functionality for you but I

01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:47,190
always try to protect the customer as

01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,540
well so that they know that they know

01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,070
that they own this they own their data

01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,460
I'm not going to be looking at their

01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:55,130
data I don't have access to their data

01:13:52,460 --> 01:14:00,390
ok yes

01:13:55,130 --> 01:14:03,810
sorry when you're working with an SDK

01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:06,960
that they eventually just abandoned and

01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:08,400
do you find it better to shim the pieces

01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,140
that you need or to just go ahead and

01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,270
write your own library for the parts

01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,820
that you need to interact with their

01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:17,040
their service yeah I just go ahead and I

01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:19,470
look at the I look at the API calls

01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,690
directly and then I just just mapped

01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:25,230
those in WordPress rather than trying to

01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:29,600
take from theirs because yeah that's

01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:29,600
just for me me personally Thanks

01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:45,490
I think you were a very interesting talk

01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:48,280
my question is a little bit more

01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:50,440
philosophical from your experience with

01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,760
working with so many different api's

01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:59,170
like Salesforce Drive and all other

01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:02,650
others which one of those were most

01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:04,810
pleasant to work with and and why what

01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,300
developers behind that API did

01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,700
differently than developers behind other

01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:13,120
guys this is the first part of the

01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:17,170
question and the second part is how do

01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:21,310
we as developers avoid building things

01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:23,230
that like so hard to maintain and then

01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,430
age like for example that you mentioned

01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:29,350
Salesforce that had has two api's and

01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:32,080
it's basically a nightmare to work with

01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:36,190
if you need some portions of one and

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:39,040
some portions of the other okay so I

01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:42,010
would say stripe will always forever be

01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,390
my shining example stripe in the early

01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:46,960
days and there were several things that

01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,460
they did right so the simplicity and I

01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,500
think a lot of that came from because

01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,610
they were very hands-on in the beginning

01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,160
so when they were trying to gain

01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:55,990
traction for their service tax rate they

01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:58,900
would hunt people down and say hey meet

01:15:55,990 --> 01:16:00,940
me in a coffee shop all right and I'll

01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:05,110
and get stripe installed for you right

01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:09,310
there so it had to be very simple the

01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:11,110
documentation was was very clear there's

01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:13,270
some documentation that looks like it

01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:16,360
was written by developers and so I would

01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:18,520
recommend always getting another eye on

01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:21,820
it always having someone from outside of

01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:24,370
your company tried to use try to use

01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,950
your API try to use your user

01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:28,840
documentation so getting you know an

01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,850
outside look at it and then the third

01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:34,000
thing that I believe that they did very

01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:37,150
very well was the developer experience

01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,100
and that was with that chat room the

01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:41,170
chat room was was awesome and I have

01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,150
seen some other companies do that so for

01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:47,870
example Marketo they host a

01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:50,510
they host an API developer where they

01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,200
call it webinar or something Q&A session

01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,790
every week

01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,530
alright so every week you have some

01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:56,210
place where you can go and ask questions

01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:58,810
I think that is that's one of the

01:16:56,210 --> 01:17:01,340
biggest things that a lot of people miss

01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:03,170
because you can get really good feedback

01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:05,000
and see where people are confused and

01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:07,460
then be able to address that in your

01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,990
documentation so in terms of developer

01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:14,780
experience you know I think those are

01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:16,070
the things that were done very well what

01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:22,190
was the second part of your question I'm

01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:25,130
sorry okay all right so that you you

01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,050
think that covers that okay great I have

01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:29,000
a question on the flip side so you don't

01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:30,890
have to name names but how have you

01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,510
developed a threshold for when - nope

01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,310
out and back away if you have that

01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:36,470
option to say you've done a great job

01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,850
when to get creative but when to say no

01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:40,040
this isn't gonna happen

01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:43,010
do you have any reflections on that sure

01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:46,520
so I mean one very clear thing is if

01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:49,010
they don't have a REST API I I back away

01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:57,080
so I'm not really not going to work with

01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:59,600
anything else and I think there is one

01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:03,350
one particular API that eyes just simply

01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:06,320
refused to work with sandboxes is a big

01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:09,410
thing if you can get a sandbox and I

01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:14,180
would say the complexity of how to get a

01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:19,160
sandbox and how how to log in to those

01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:20,600
sand boxes but yeah you know you you can

01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,820
kind of look at the documentation if

01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,440
they don't have documentation you know

01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,240
that's kind of a red flag sometimes

01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,770
they'll keep it you know behind lock and

01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:31,220
key you'll have to ask and they'll send

01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:35,150
it out you know so but it's just you

01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:39,550
know something to to consider but but

01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:45,070
yeah the rest really rest is kind of the

01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:45,070
you know kind of my my threshold there

01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:54,690
that's it okay thank you so much

01:18:50,750 --> 01:19:04,689

01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:28,220
all right Shannon get started if you

01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:31,370
could just make sure all of your cell

01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:33,890
phones are turned off and possibly move

01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:35,030
to the middle of the room or just make

01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:38,270
sure that there's room for people who

01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:42,470
are coming in a little bit late and if

01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:45,050
anyone needs any accessibility that they

01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,260
if you need anything at all just let us

01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:47,920
know

01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:51,860
just contact someone in a red shirt

01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,970
there will be a QA after the session so

01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,710
if you could hold your questions until

01:26:52,970 --> 01:27:00,440
then we'll have someone come around with

01:26:54,710 --> 01:27:02,450
a mic and also just a reminders that

01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:04,240
there's a contributor day on Sunday and

01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:06,680
we'd love to have you come to that and

01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,960
also if you haven't picked up your

01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:11,240
t-shirt yet they will be at the swag

01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:15,830
table in the sponsor room downstairs on

01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:19,430

hi everyone um welcome to just enough

01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:09,150
word react for WordPress I'm really

01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:12,000
excited to be here and thank you for

01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:15,000
coming this is me like Mike was just

01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,139
mentioned I work at wordpress.com VIP

01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,179
and my job is to health support

01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:23,639
developers and how they're using

01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:26,820
WordPress generally and the new block

01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:29,190
editor as well and just help them use it

01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,929
better um but I also have a background

01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:34,199
doing a lot of freelance work which is

01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:35,639
what I did before so and I've been

01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:37,739
involved in the WordPress community for

01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:39,929
a really long time and one of the things

01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:43,110
I really like about WordPress is that it

01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:44,520
has a really nice on-ramp you can get

01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:46,520
started with just a little bit of

01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:52,170
knowledge and ramp it up really easily

01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:53,310
and so one of the things about WordPress

01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:55,020
and I just started out is you didn't

01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:57,060
really need to know a lot of PHP

01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,460
although of course it helps you just

01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,790
needed to know enough and that would

01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:04,679
help you start off maybe just getting

01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:07,020
your theme started and then maybe you

01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,670
would write a couple of functions in a

01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:11,429
theme and then maybe you'd write a

01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:13,409
simple plugin and then maybe a more

01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:16,739
complicated one and then that could be

01:29:13,409 --> 01:29:20,030
an on-ramp to contributing to the core

01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:23,579
part the code part of WordPress core and

01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:25,230
and so it was really nice strategy to

01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:27,270
get started with something really easy

01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:29,460
and so what I wanted to do with this

01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:32,520
talk is do the same thing with reaction

01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,960
because I think when Gutenberg or what

01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,320
we call the blog header now was first

01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,730
announced a lot of developers were

01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,380
worried that they'd have to learn a lot

01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:43,619
of new technology and they might be

01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:46,409
behind and really it's not quite some

01:29:43,619 --> 01:29:48,300
tire and so this talk is intended for

01:29:46,409 --> 01:29:49,949
people who haven't used the blog header

01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:53,460
too that much but really want to get

01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:57,179
started right away without doing a whole

01:29:53,460 --> 01:30:00,570
bunch of course work and and get their

01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:02,219
hands wet you know get started and so

01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:04,560
this is the beginning of the on-ramp for

01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:07,500
react that's what this talk is intended

01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,599
to be um a couple notes about this

01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,869
presentation I will make all the slides

01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:12,550
available

01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:15,550
so you can you don't have to take too

01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:18,189
many notes and on each one I've put

01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:19,510
little references and links out so that

01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:23,050
when these slides are available you can

01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:24,429
use this as a learning resource and you

01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:27,189
know in the spirit of good attribution

01:30:24,429 --> 01:30:30,010
but also as a way to learn more so if

01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:31,329
anything really appeals to you you'll

01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:37,929
have all that information at your

01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:40,179
fingertips so the new block editor it

01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:43,139
was originally presented as Gutenberg

01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:45,789
but now that Gutenberg has just been

01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:47,320
added into WordPress core we're just

01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:51,010
talking about it the block editor

01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:52,630
because it's just right there and it's a

01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:54,579
new post and page editing experience

01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:57,249
that makes it easy to create rich posted

01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:58,539
layouts and using blocks and it's sort

01:30:57,249 --> 01:31:01,389
of like the newest evolution of

01:30:58,539 --> 01:31:03,099
WordPress because it's not such a big

01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,780
difference but especially from the user

01:31:03,099 --> 01:31:08,769
point of view and it just makes

01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:11,590
everything really a lot easier and I

01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:14,280
like it it's a lot of fun I use it on my

01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:19,630
own blog of course as well as that work

01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:22,119
and so just a couple of really nice

01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:24,909
features is that you can use it to guide

01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:27,519
content creation and you can use it sort

01:31:24,909 --> 01:31:30,789
of in the place of or in addition to

01:31:27,519 --> 01:31:33,429
some of the features that we've all used

01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:36,539
in WordPress up until now so a custom

01:31:33,429 --> 01:31:39,820
post type shortcodes meta boxes

01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:41,739
sometimes widgets as well all these

01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:44,499
little features that have allowed you to

01:31:41,739 --> 01:31:46,389
add content in special ways for special

01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,309
sites you can now use the block editor

01:31:46,389 --> 01:31:50,019
to do that and it gives the user a lot

01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:51,760
of control but it still allows you to

01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:56,709
have a really uniform professional

01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:59,829
experience so it helps me WordPress like

01:31:56,709 --> 01:32:04,510
a really vibrant easy to use really

01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:06,610
performant tool and I mean I hope you've

01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:09,789
all seen the block editor but just to

01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:11,979
illustrate the concept I just have a

01:32:09,789 --> 01:32:14,590
couple of slides of how pretty it looks

01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:17,889
because what it's allowing people to do

01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:20,979
now is do a really beautiful magazine

01:32:17,889 --> 01:32:23,170
style layout without a lot of code so

01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:24,699
the user really has a lot of control

01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:27,070
they can really produce something really

01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:29,739
beautiful and they don't need to know a

01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:34,030
lot to be able to do that so we get nice

01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:37,559
images we get beautiful galleries one of

01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:39,760
my pet peeves before was pull quotes

01:32:37,559 --> 01:32:41,969
full coats were always hard to sort of

01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,499
organize they always looked a little bit

01:32:41,969 --> 01:32:45,999
off in certain conditions and now you

01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:47,920
can just sort of move them around in

01:32:45,999 --> 01:32:53,349
editor and just have a really seamless

01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:56,710
experience which I love but how does it

01:32:53,349 --> 01:32:58,989
all work and how it all works is with

01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:02,610
react so I'm just gonna give you sort of

01:32:58,989 --> 01:33:06,519
a basic introduction to act for Pianist

01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:08,050
react is that very core a JavaScript

01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:10,900
library so it's just a bunch of files

01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:13,480
that allow you to do things with

01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:16,960
JavaScript but also it's a tool for

01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:20,769
building user interfaces so it's what

01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:25,300
powers the back end editing experience

01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:26,670
and react is an open source product it's

01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,659
built by the people at Facebook

01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:31,119
originally but of course it's a

01:33:28,659 --> 01:33:34,150
community project now so anyone can

01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:38,219
contribute to it and what it does is it

01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:42,760
creates an in an in-memory data cache

01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:44,889
and computes the differences and then

01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:47,619
puts them into the Dom for easy access

01:33:44,889 --> 01:33:48,219
and it uses JavaScript or maybe uses a

01:33:47,619 --> 01:33:53,139
JSX

01:33:48,219 --> 01:33:57,670
and so that's sort of a very simple

01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:59,429
overview and I think it was 2015 at the

01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:01,719
state of the world that matt said

01:33:59,429 --> 01:34:03,789
everyone should learn JavaScript deeply

01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:06,190
but sometimes it's hard to get started

01:34:03,789 --> 01:34:07,840
so I think when when I look at all that

01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:11,800
online courses sometimes it's hard to

01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:13,719
see you know what is less than number 15

01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,820
gonna bring me because it's hard to see

01:34:13,719 --> 01:34:17,230
the final product but when you look at

01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,269
blocks and you want to use them right

01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:21,699
now you can see the finished product

01:34:19,269 --> 01:34:24,400
right away so one of the examples I like

01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:27,760
to use is if you're using blocks for

01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,989
example for a recipe site you can see

01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,820
each block is a different type of

01:34:28,989 --> 01:34:33,280
content you could have a block or say

01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:36,309
ingredients another one for directions

01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,040
one for the main photo and then another

01:34:36,309 --> 01:34:40,340
one

01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,590
um you know just a description of your

01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,820
experience cooking for example and all

01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:51,860
of these pieces of content can be

01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:54,740
different blocks so you can use you can

01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:56,780
get started building blocks to do each

01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:59,330
of those components a little bit easier

01:34:56,780 --> 01:35:00,530
than you can learning how to use react

01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:02,060
use in one of these online courses

01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:04,790
because you can fin that see the

01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:07,340
finished product you know what an

01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:08,990
ingredients block is supposed to look

01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,670
like on your finished blog and that

01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,710
makes it easier to build it it makes it

01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:15,850
easier to design all the steps that you

01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:18,050
can use to get there in the first place

01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:21,170
so blocks can be seen sort of like

01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:23,870
plugins you can put core behavior into

01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:26,930
blocks or you can put sort of custom

01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:29,330
behavior plugins into blocks and what it

01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,490
does is it separates all of what you're

01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:34,370
doing into two layers an editorial layer

01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:38,650
and a data layer and the way it's done

01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:42,080
is that what the block editor is is

01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:44,300
effectively an abstraction layer between

01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:47,150
react and the WordPress we all know and

01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:49,580
love so that's what we built as the

01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:51,860
community when we built Gutenberg or the

01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:55,970
block editor we built an abstraction

01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:57,770
layer that makes it easy to use the

01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:59,810
block editor with what we already know

01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:00,950
and I was really impressed when I first

01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,780
started playing around with it because

01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:07,400
it's it's pretty intuitive

01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:11,540
it uses the same sort of coding I don't

01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:15,200
know um strategies that I'm used to as a

01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:16,550
wordpress developer and it's very

01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,650
intuitive so I think it was really well

01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:23,360
done and what it does is it divides

01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,320
these and sort of two components so this

01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,680
is just sort of a diagram that

01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,350
illustrates that in one sort of column

01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:32,690
is all the processing involved in react

01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:35,150
but the front-end is completely separate

01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:36,710
so you don't have a performance hit when

01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,210
you're using the block editor it's

01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:40,880
completely independent it's really in

01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:44,530
the backend but also even if you're

01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,630
using Gutenberg with really large teams

01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:49,960
on WordPress VIP we work with people who

01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:51,280
are using a Guttenberg in an editorial

01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,840
environment for example and they might

01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,210
have hundreds or thousands of editors

01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:57,730
editing content on a single site at any

01:36:55,210 --> 01:37:02,260
given time and they're still able to use

01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:03,700
this a still performance system so I'm

01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:05,100
going to show you some code bits and but

01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:07,450
I'm not gonna go through it line by line

01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,280
the the point of this is just to

01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:12,070
illustrate that it doesn't take a lot to

01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,600
get started so this is how you would

01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:15,730
declare a block type and this is a

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,320
really simple one this is just a hello

01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:20,320
world block type and it's just to show

01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:22,810
you the different components in it and

01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:26,620
it's only really a few lines of code so

01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:28,420
it's possible to to create this I would

01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:31,890
point you to the Gutenberg Handbook

01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:35,500
which has some sort of prototypical

01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:37,600
block models that you can work with copy

01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:40,000
and also download other people's blocks

01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,980
and see what they're doing just to get

01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,020
an idea of what's out there but

01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:51,520
basically it's just these few layers and

01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:53,620
once you have this sort of model set up

01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,930
and there's also an entire talk on this

01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:57,910
also at this event so I encourage you to

01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:59,950
attend that as well you can do some

01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:02,980
really cool stuff so these are some of

01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:06,400
my favorite things about being able to

01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:08,170
make your own blocks and use them my top

01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:11,590
favorite is reusable blocks because if

01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:12,910
you've ever had to copy and paste from I

01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:15,610
don't know maybe in your work

01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:17,470
environments from some ancient outdated

01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:19,720
version of word and you have to copy

01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:21,910
this one sniffing of text multiple times

01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,510
over and over again you don't have to do

01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:25,960
that anymore

01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:28,360
you can just make any block reusable and

01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:30,550
then use it over and over again I think

01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:32,830
the best example is if you're doing

01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:36,160
something like like say you're doing

01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:38,220
some self promotion if you wrote a book

01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,030
for example you could have a snippet

01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:42,310
illustrating the concepts that you're

01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:43,660
that you're illustrating your book and

01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:45,940
you can use it over and over again in

01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:48,490
multiple pages and it's just ready for

01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:51,910
you already there another thing that's

01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:53,280
really cool is which is coming soon to

01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:55,800
only workflows so if you

01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:58,230
can with a team you can have for example

01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,840
an editorial checklist you know check my

01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:03,360
spelling and make sure everything's

01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,040
properly attributed is there a featured

01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,720
image for this post that sort of thing

01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,690
so that's something that's coming and

01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,340
that's gonna make it really helpful to

01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:14,880
have a really professional smooth

01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:17,370
looking website as well another thing

01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,020
you can do is have at an ad aware

01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:20,880
editorial experience so the people who

01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,240
are adding the content you can see where

01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,920
ads will go where there's a mismatch

01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:28,170
where that could be improved and that

01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,640
sort of thing and you can also do block

01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,080
level locking so I like this feature

01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:34,350
because if you're doing something like a

01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:36,420
recipe site and you want to for example

01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:38,820
always have ingredients always have

01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:40,140
directions always have a title you can

01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:43,050
make sure that those blocks show up all

01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:44,880
the time but maybe you don't need a pull

01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:46,860
quote in that situation so you don't

01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,260
have to include that so you can have a

01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:53,220
lot of control as a theme develop over

01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:54,630
over what is shown to the user and

01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:56,340
encourage them to fill out all the

01:39:54,630 --> 01:40:00,980
fields that are necessary but take away

01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:04,650
all the stuff that just adds clutter and

01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:07,250
I think Gutenberg is really large so

01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:09,300
when it first came out as a plugin I

01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:12,870
like ran it through clock which is a

01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:14,430
little open-source power application

01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:16,910
that lets you see how many lines of code

01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:21,510
is in something and it's kind of giant

01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:23,100
it's a lot of lines of code but the good

01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:24,600
thing about using it right away is you

01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,220
don't need to really look at all the

01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,260
code you don't really need to start you

01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:31,740
just need to start with playing around

01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:34,050
with the blocks themselves so even

01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:39,000
though this can seem intimidating it's

01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:41,520
not really so react itself

01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,690
like I said react is a JavaScript

01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,270
library for building user interfaces

01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:50,130
there's a lot using a lot of open source

01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:53,910
projects how it works is that use Jason

01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:55,710
literals and these are really simple

01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:57,950
because they're declarative and they're

01:40:55,710 --> 01:41:00,810
human readable so they really give you

01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:02,880
like sort of a something that you can

01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,930
understand right away even if you're not

01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,210
quite sure how to put it together

01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:09,870
yourself so what I've done here is

01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:13,380
I've I've written a jason literal for a

01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:14,820
t-shirt so it would be a this would be

01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:17,100
for my company t-shirt so it would have

01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:20,900
my logo on it yep your logo it would be

01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:24,150
navy blue and it would be size large and

01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:27,930
long sleeves false boolean so you can

01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:29,760
have a series of attributes and boolean

01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:32,700
features and this is like the most

01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,650
simple idea of a literal and it doesn't

01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:36,900
do anything but it just gives you the

01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:39,390
idea of how its comprehensible to human

01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:44,340
beings right off the bat and the example

01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:47,460
before is a real one and basically it

01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:48,989
takes your Jason literal what what with

01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,640
the people who are developing the block

01:41:48,989 --> 01:41:52,320
editor did is they needed a place to

01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,850
store these Jason literals that made

01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,440
sense but that was also backwards

01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:58,230
compatible so what they did was

01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,930
something sort of unique they put the

01:41:58,230 --> 01:42:02,670
Jason literals inside of HTML comments

01:42:00,930 --> 01:42:04,410
and one of the reasons that was done is

01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:07,350
because comments are really flexible

01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:09,390
there aren't a lot of rules around what

01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:11,820
you can put in a comment but it still

01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:16,140
maintains valid code throughout which is

01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:18,450
which is very important and allows a lot

01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:21,360
of flexibility but still allows you to

01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:24,420
use prefer to be backward compatible

01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,530
with all the different versions of

01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:27,330
WordPress out there in the different

01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:32,310
plugins that aren't used in all sorts of

01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:34,620
different use cases react

01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:36,980
organizes its data inside an object tree

01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:40,890
so it's sort of in groupings that

01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:43,020
identify different parts of the code so

01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:46,140
you can isolate each grouping and each

01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:50,030
grouping is readable a home so you can

01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:50,030
sort of identify what's happening

01:42:55,090 --> 01:43:02,620
okay and um so Gutenberg isn't HTML but

01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:05,830
it's inside the HTML which is sort of

01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:09,010
like the clever way of making it

01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:18,600
accessible without damaging the the

01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:21,400
validity of the code and templates so

01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,470
templates can be arranged as a series of

01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:25,540
block types so like I mentioned before a

01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:30,010
perfect example would be a cooking blog

01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:32,140
where you have ingredients directions

01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:35,470
photo etc but another example that you

01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:37,060
might see more often is an e-commerce

01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:38,650
site where you always want to have a

01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:40,510
product image you always want to have a

01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:42,430
price you always want to have a

01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:45,220
description and so you can organize

01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:47,230
these things into templates so that the

01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:48,520
people using the system have all the

01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,620
right information right at their hands

01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,020
but they don't have a super busy

01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:55,120
interface and of course you could always

01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:58,120
add things in when you need to if you're

01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:59,670
the user so the template log property

01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,380
allows you to do that allows you to

01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:04,720
force for example a product price to

01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:08,230
always be available or in the case of my

01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:10,360
recipe blog the ingredient list and it

01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:11,950
allows you to sign specific templates to

01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,190
existing post types so if you're using

01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:17,800
custom post types like you might for

01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:21,070
cooking cooking site you might have one

01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:22,810
for specific recipes but you might also

01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:25,560
want to have book reviews on that

01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:28,090
website and you might also want to have

01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:29,800
some sort of guest interviews for a for

01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:31,540
example and those can each be a custom

01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:33,910
post type and that will allow you more

01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:36,280
flexibility later on to sort them out

01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:38,740
into different types of of content

01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:41,800
presentation on the website but still

01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:44,070
keep the interface really manageable for

01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,070
the user

01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:49,950
and the whole point is to make sure that

01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,490
it's compatible with what existed in the

01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,100
past

01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:55,110
so it allows you to keep using short

01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:57,420
codes it allows you to keep using custom

01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:59,730
post types and of course it allows you

01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:04,340
to keep using meta boxes and I think

01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:04,340
meta boxes are really interesting

01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:09,600
instance to discuss I'm just gonna get

01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,920
to that in a second so short codes you

01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,330
can still use them there's also a short

01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,750
code block so if you have a short code

01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:18,240
that exists you can just put it in and

01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:20,040
there's plan mechanisms for previewing

01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,570
them in place they're actually plugins

01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:26,940
that already exist that let you do this

01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:29,010
now they're not necessarily all very

01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:31,880
stable right now but you can still get

01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:34,440
an idea of how this is gonna work

01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:36,030
I'm custom post types you could use

01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,830
blocks with custom post types right now

01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:39,750
so if you have a site that relies on

01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:43,020
this you could just build these box

01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:46,890
right in right away so they're supported

01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:48,810
but the block editor rest api and you

01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:51,420
can opt out of this entirely if you

01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:54,510
don't want to use the block editor for

01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:57,480
specific custom post types and meta

01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:59,430
boxes so i hear a lot of people worried

01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:01,530
that they've invested a lot of time into

01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:03,060
for example a plug-in that uses a lot of

01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:07,830
metal boxes and they're not quite sure

01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:11,280
how to get all of that content into a

01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:13,860
site that uses a block editor and it's

01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:15,450
actually not as tricky as you might

01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:17,280
think I've just given you a little

01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:21,210
snippet of code that shows you how easy

01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:24,150
it could be of course meta boxes can be

01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:26,310
complex some plugins plugins use a lot

01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:29,100
of them but I like to point to the

01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:32,070
example of Yost Yost has Yost is a

01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:35,490
really complex plug-in but it relies

01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:38,250
heavily on meta boxes and Yoast right

01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:41,940
now works with a new block editor very

01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:43,950
seamlessly so I think if if the Yoast

01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:47,570
plugin can use it properly then you can

01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:51,510
- and it's not as tricky or as

01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:54,300
intimidating as it could be and this is

01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:56,280
definitely one of my favorite things

01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,439
about the new block editing experience

01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:00,840
especially if you're a designer

01:46:58,439 --> 01:47:03,899
rather than a developer I'm sure you've

01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:05,459
all seen that one website where you know

01:47:03,899 --> 01:47:07,889
somebody's using a certain color palette

01:47:05,459 --> 01:47:10,289
and then when user comes in and adds

01:47:07,889 --> 01:47:13,769
maybe a heading and it's just a slightly

01:47:10,289 --> 01:47:16,110
off color of red and it's so jarring and

01:47:13,769 --> 01:47:19,829
so this way you can set a specific color

01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:22,469
palette for a theme right into the code

01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:24,629
and you can see the code just down below

01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:27,629
and it's just you know two lines of code

01:47:24,629 --> 01:47:29,610
plus a list of hex color codes and then

01:47:27,629 --> 01:47:31,349
you can set up your themes so that the

01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,419
color choices that are available to

01:47:31,349 --> 01:47:35,340
users are the on-brand themes that you

01:47:33,419 --> 01:47:36,719
want to use and of course you're not

01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:38,879
limiting choice because you still have

01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,019
the you know the color wheel option

01:47:38,879 --> 01:47:43,530
where you can choose anything you like

01:47:40,019 --> 01:47:46,889
but the chances of that you know join a

01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:50,519
friend red being used are much less and

01:47:46,889 --> 01:47:53,489
you still give the user a lot of ability

01:47:50,519 --> 01:47:54,599
to customize and I think the the main

01:47:53,489 --> 01:47:56,849
advantage is you can have a really

01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:59,479
professional look because that consists

01:47:56,849 --> 01:48:02,760
of seeing color consistency and fonts

01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:05,010
professional layout that all contributes

01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,349
to having a website that that is easy to

01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:11,280
visit easy to use for the visitor as

01:48:07,349 --> 01:48:12,840
well as for the user and I just want to

01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:16,559
talk about building blocks so you can

01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:23,280
see what's involved as well so this is

01:48:16,559 --> 01:48:26,760
the basic code for a block there's

01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:31,760
basically a block type registration and

01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:35,789
then there's the related functions and

01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:38,010
so just I'm gonna just skip ahead just a

01:48:35,789 --> 01:48:40,469
little bit and this is like the the

01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:42,090
block style so blocks have classes

01:48:40,469 --> 01:48:43,699
applied to them just like many other

01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:46,199
WordPress components so if you're a

01:48:43,699 --> 01:48:49,379
theme designer in particular you can

01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:50,909
latch on to those classes and do exactly

01:48:49,379 --> 01:48:53,820
the same things you've already already

01:48:50,909 --> 01:48:55,469
been doing and add you know the colors

01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,329
you want the fonts you want etcetera so

01:48:55,469 --> 01:48:58,949
in the example of a pull quote for

01:48:57,329 --> 01:49:00,869
example you can you know make that

01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:02,789
larger make that use an italic make

01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:06,359
these a different font and that's really

01:49:02,789 --> 01:49:09,030
easy to do and then what you need to do

01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:10,389
is put your your block code and your

01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:16,840
theme code together

01:49:10,389 --> 01:49:18,639
then it works really well so you can

01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,619
have editable fields you can have

01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:23,979
toolbars and inspectors you can have

01:49:20,619 --> 01:49:26,199
dynamic blocks and you can if your once

01:49:23,979 --> 01:49:28,360
you've leveled up past the really basic

01:49:26,199 --> 01:49:29,619
block pass the hello world block then

01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,409
you can add in all these different

01:49:29,619 --> 01:49:35,139
inputs to make your block really

01:49:32,409 --> 01:49:37,510
interesting and to add some of the

01:49:35,139 --> 01:49:40,329
features that you would see and in for

01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:42,159
example of hope quote so color choices

01:49:40,329 --> 01:49:44,019
things like that and if you're working

01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:46,179
with forums for example you can build

01:49:44,019 --> 01:49:53,860
blocks that include really much more

01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:57,459
interesting input choices and you can do

01:49:53,860 --> 01:50:01,119
this all with the word press the Li so

01:49:57,459 --> 01:50:03,340
if you're used to using that um this is

01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:05,320
all you need to type in to get a super

01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:07,300
basic block so it can go really quickly

01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:13,869
if that's something that that you're

01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:16,869
already doing and I think that the best

01:50:13,869 --> 01:50:18,729
strategy for getting started is the same

01:50:16,869 --> 01:50:20,499
strategy of how you gonna go so the best

01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:22,899
way to win it go isn't actually to win

01:50:20,499 --> 01:50:25,239
it's to lose really quickly your first

01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:27,459
50 games because it's in losing that you

01:50:25,239 --> 01:50:30,909
you acquire the most amount of knowledge

01:50:27,459 --> 01:50:32,380
so the best way to learn how to use

01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:35,110
blocks is actually to break some blocks

01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:39,399
and that's definitely how I used to work

01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:42,099
to use WordPress I had you know before I

01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:44,349
did this as my job I had a wordpress

01:50:42,099 --> 01:50:45,729
site and basically attempted to break it

01:50:44,349 --> 01:50:47,919
in as many ways as possible

01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:51,789
in order to learn how it worked and that

01:50:47,919 --> 01:50:54,130
is exactly how I've learned to use the

01:50:51,789 --> 01:50:56,349
block editor as well because it's really

01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:59,139
easy to see how the pieces move together

01:50:56,349 --> 01:51:00,789
when your goal is actually to break the

01:50:59,139 --> 01:51:05,050
system instead of how to build it

01:51:00,789 --> 01:51:08,110
so I recommend a strategy and a couple

01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:10,300
of tech tips and tricks if you want to

01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:12,939
get started you can turn any block into

01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:16,300
a reusable block so again if you're on

01:51:12,939 --> 01:51:18,149
the if you have a recipe site for

01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:20,139
example and you've just written a book

01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:22,570
or you have some sort of promotion

01:51:20,139 --> 01:51:23,409
coming up or an event you can have a one

01:51:22,570 --> 01:51:25,599
block that

01:51:23,409 --> 01:51:27,939
scribes you know you're a book where you

01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:29,499
can buy it on Amazon or your event with

01:51:27,939 --> 01:51:31,510
all the details and just reuse it in

01:51:29,499 --> 01:51:33,760
multiple places in your site you can

01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:36,309
make any block reuse of a block and you

01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,659
can take that away if you want to if you

01:51:36,309 --> 01:51:39,729
don't want to use it anymore when the

01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:42,010
promotion is finished for example and

01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:44,709
because it's being reused throughout if

01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:46,659
for example I don't know how your book

01:51:44,709 --> 01:51:49,300
is taken off Amazon but you want to sell

01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:51,489
it through another service you can just

01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,929
edit it in one place and have it updated

01:51:51,489 --> 01:51:55,889
everywhere you don't have to go through

01:51:52,929 --> 01:51:58,179
the whole site all the time

01:51:55,889 --> 01:52:00,039
the next thing I'm really excited about

01:51:58,179 --> 01:52:03,010
is something that's coming up and that's

01:52:00,039 --> 01:52:04,809
the block directory I have a sort of a

01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:07,840
more polished image of what that might

01:52:04,809 --> 01:52:09,699
look like but I really like this one and

01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,919
the reason I like it is because it's

01:52:09,699 --> 01:52:13,419
just the sketch and I think this really

01:52:11,919 --> 01:52:15,999
speaks to the spirit of open source

01:52:13,419 --> 01:52:17,679
software because you can get in on the

01:52:15,999 --> 01:52:19,630
ground floor and affect how this is

01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,239
going to be built and what its gonna do

01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:24,729
and how it's gonna work and you can do

01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:26,829
that now and also I think it's kind of

01:52:24,729 --> 01:52:30,429
inspiring because all my big ideas start

01:52:26,829 --> 01:52:33,150
small so you don't have to arrive at

01:52:30,429 --> 01:52:35,739
though in in WordPress core with

01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:39,880
everything all set up with your

01:52:35,739 --> 01:52:45,010
excellent knowledge in react and PHP and

01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:47,110
CSS and database management although all

01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:51,550
of those would be wonderful and you can

01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:54,699
start off really really small this is a

01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:56,889
more polished example of what this might

01:52:54,699 --> 01:52:59,590
look like and you can see it's sort of

01:52:56,889 --> 01:53:03,249
modeled on the plugin directory that we

01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:05,559
have now and ideally all the blocks that

01:53:03,249 --> 01:53:07,869
people build are going to be able to be

01:53:05,559 --> 01:53:09,699
added to any site just through this

01:53:07,869 --> 01:53:11,679
interface I think right now a lot of

01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:13,360
people add blocks will they use the

01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:15,669
default blocks or they add locks that

01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:17,260
are that are bundled with a theme but

01:53:15,669 --> 01:53:20,199
soon you'll be able to add blocks

01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:22,719
individually and separate out the theme

01:53:20,199 --> 01:53:25,389
from blocks so you can have a theme that

01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:26,949
works well with with a certain set of

01:53:25,389 --> 01:53:28,630
blocks you can use the same theme for

01:53:26,949 --> 01:53:34,059
example for a recipe site as you might

01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:35,790
with I don't know an e-commerce site and

01:53:34,059 --> 01:53:39,630
then use the blocks that apply to that

01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:42,090
situation so what if you want to get

01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:43,410
started doing this now there's a lot of

01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:45,600
ways to do that number one I'd recommend

01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:47,160
start experimenting and start breaking

01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:52,710
things

01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:54,600
second you can pay attention to what's

01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:56,390
happening in slack and whether that's

01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,040
actually contributing or just lurking

01:53:56,390 --> 01:54:01,200
it's really informative and I think it's

01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,910
really interesting to see that it's a

01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:05,160
project that's being developed by actual

01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:07,260
people it's not something that arrives

01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:08,880
fully formed and that's sort of the

01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:10,560
beauty of open software as well is that

01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,420
it's always a work in progress it's

01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,610
always the the journey not the

01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:16,170
destination and you can sort of see how

01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:19,350
decisions are being made and you can

01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:21,240
influence them you can contribute you

01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:23,370
can contribute in ways that are very

01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:26,160
code related but you can also do things

01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:28,470
like contribute to documentation make

01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:31,550
sure that the code base is properly

01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:36,390
commented contribute to translations

01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:38,370
contribute to community work etc and I

01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:41,460
also wanted to mention before I take

01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:43,530
questions that word press may be where I

01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:45,900
work is hiring so if you have any

01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:48,090
questions about that at all please come

01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:49,710
see me after this talk and I'll be

01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:53,340
available in the hallways to take any

01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:55,230
questions you might have about that and

01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:58,230
now what I'll do is I'll take any

01:54:55,230 --> 01:55:00,000
questions from the audience if you have

01:54:58,230 --> 01:55:02,970
anything any questions about the block

01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,590
editor experience reaction general how

01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:09,050
it's all put together how you can get

01:55:04,590 --> 01:55:09,050
started I'd love to hear from you

01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:27,749
so if I'm using a meta box now and I

01:55:25,059 --> 01:55:30,999
switch and start using a block instead

01:55:27,749 --> 01:55:34,749
it's going to store that data in the

01:55:30,999 --> 01:55:40,840
content instead of in a separate query

01:55:34,749 --> 01:55:42,400
to the post meta so what it's gonna do

01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:46,360
is it's gonna store it while you're

01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:48,940
editing it in HTML comments but then

01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:51,820
it's gonna add it into the database as

01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:53,469
well so it's sort of parallel systems

01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:56,499
and it depends what you're doing and you

01:55:53,469 --> 01:55:58,329
can you can build it in different ways

01:55:56,499 --> 01:56:01,300
depending on your needs but it can still

01:55:58,329 --> 01:56:03,400
be fully accessible by the API by the

01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:06,369
database by individual queries after the

01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,800
fact but do I need a separate like right

01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:10,989
now if I do a meta box I'm storing that

01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:14,710
in the post meta so then I have to do a

01:56:10,989 --> 01:56:16,960
get post meta query in addition to the

01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:20,710
content query do I still have that extra

01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:24,670
query or have I saved a query I'd have

01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:27,280
to see it to say specifically so I'm so

01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:29,769
I'm not quite sure it would depend how

01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:32,849
you doing it okay and just the last

01:56:29,769 --> 01:56:36,039
thing is the comments that are stored

01:56:32,849 --> 01:56:37,659
the the JSON comments that are stored

01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:39,999
those don't ever show up on the front

01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:41,499
end they don't you can tell people are

01:56:39,999 --> 01:56:44,530
using them because you can see the

01:56:41,499 --> 01:56:46,960
classes so you can know if somebody's

01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:48,639
using I mean I mean and I guess in

01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,679
theory you could also remove those if

01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:52,449
you're very concerned about that but

01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:55,479
that's something that's happening in the

01:56:52,449 --> 01:56:57,659
editor layer not in the front end and so

01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:59,710
react isn't something that's really

01:56:57,659 --> 01:57:01,960
operating heavily on the front end it's

01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:04,329
really the editor experience so it's

01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,880
really what's happening for the user and

01:57:04,329 --> 01:57:07,989
I think like because what's happening in

01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,199
the editor experience and what's

01:57:07,989 --> 01:57:12,999
happening on the front end looks similar

01:57:10,199 --> 01:57:15,249
it's hard mentally to separate those

01:57:12,999 --> 01:57:18,749
things out but it really is something

01:57:15,249 --> 01:57:18,749
that's happening for editors

01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:27,830
yeah so I was interested in knowing more

01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:30,710
about how you handle block recoveries

01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:32,510
like when you create a template and then

01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:34,430
something changes in that template after

01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:36,590
you've already created it so the user

01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:40,700
goes to visit the editor and now they

01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:42,650
have broken blocks or maybe you insert

01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:45,140
some kind of block filter and now you

01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:47,050
run into another example of a broken

01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:51,070
block like what do you do to avoid that

01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:53,630
early on as opposed to when you're in

01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:58,760
mid change and you cause all these

01:57:53,630 --> 01:58:00,440
blocks to break um well can you tell me

01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:04,850
a bit more about how is the block

01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:07,340
breaking like when the data that the

01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:10,840
editor expects to see it is different

01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:10,840
from that data that is saved

01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:20,980
that sounds really specific um I guess

01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,900
again I'd have to see the code

01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:25,480
specifically to be able to comment

01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:29,100
really on that really specific situation

01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:31,120
I think the best strategy is always to

01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:33,580
you know build as future-proof as

01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:35,890
possible make sure like think in terms

01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:38,470
of the fact that your user might take

01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:41,230
out every block and add in every block

01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:43,960
and really like like I mentioned early

01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:46,390
try to break it yourself like if you're

01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,100
if your strategy is that you're you your

01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:51,070
user might try to break every single

01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:55,120
single thing in this how can you make

01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:57,370
this stronger more performant just

01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:58,780
better all-around then you can sort of

01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:01,920
head off some of those situations in

01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:04,900
advance because you'll you'll be using

01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:07,110
like more standardised code you'll be

01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:09,850
thinking in terms of more education

01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:12,070
cases and and just building something

01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:15,910
that's a bit stronger in terms of that

01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:19,739
that sort of use case that's probably

01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:19,739
the best strategy okay

01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:35,520
so his case might not be as education

01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:39,420
you think we ran the exact same thing

01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:43,080
where we have a plugin that creates a

01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:45,390
block for us we create a reusable block

01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:48,540
based off of that for a template we

01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:50,070
reuse that block everywhere else and if

01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:52,650
they need to make any changes we tell

01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:55,860
them to go ahead and detach when the

01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:57,990
plug-in author updates and makes changes

01:59:55,860 --> 02:00:02,040
to that those changes don't get

01:59:57,990 --> 02:00:03,720
reflected to the reusable block they get

02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:07,530
reflected back to the block that's in

02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:10,650
place and that's where it breaks so is

02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:13,340
there a way for us to create a template

02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:16,350
a reusable block that the plug-in author

02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:19,470
like is there a way to update the

02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:22,290
reusable block so that it doesn't break

02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:24,590
the block set it's being used everywhere

02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:24,590
else

02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:35,330
probably but I'm not sure that you would

02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:36,770
warrant you in some ways because what

02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:38,420
you're doing when you do that is

02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:40,340
breaking the backwards-compatible

02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:44,240
compatibility of all the content you've

02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:46,220
already created so it depending on how

02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:47,870
often you use a reusable block and what

02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:51,260
the use case is and where it's being

02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:52,340
used you might you might not want to or

02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:54,800
you what you might want to do is

02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:59,600
recreate a different block and use that

02:00:54,800 --> 02:01:03,020
because that would be a that would have

02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:07,700
a better chance of not breaking things

02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:09,350
if the plugin developer always developed

02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:11,150
in a way that would always update that

02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:13,010
block it might have unintended

02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:15,020
consequences for users who weren't

02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:17,300
expecting that and so I don't know if

02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:18,170
that's necessarily the the right

02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:20,840
strategy

02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:23,570
so basically we're we're breaking the

02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:26,390
idea of reusable blocks if we create

02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:28,010
them as a template with the anticipation

02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:29,690
that we would modify them later on

02:01:28,010 --> 02:01:32,330
reusable blocks are just meant to be

02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:34,520
created once and never modified again as

02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:36,080
they're dropped into content well

02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:37,880
they're meant to be modified again and

02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:40,790
absolutely and modify it across all of

02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:42,680
them but but if you're using a plug-in

02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:48,260
to create them like depending on the

02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:50,150
creation mechanism then maybe that that

02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:52,790
might like I mean a plugin can be

02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:54,500
anything right a plug-in can can add any

02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:58,330
kinds of different types of content so

02:01:54,500 --> 02:02:00,650
it really depends what you're doing but

02:01:58,330 --> 02:02:03,940
there's a usefulness in having those two

02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:03,940
things separated okay

02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:13,270
okay we have a Twitter question Oh heavy

02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,970
use react in blocks on the front end or

02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:18,870
have you used to react in WordPress any

02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:22,630
theme just on the front end

02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:26,590
okay so react is built into the backend

02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:28,840
you could come up with a really

02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:31,630
ingenious way to edit directly on the

02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:33,910
front-end and it's my knowledge that

02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:35,320
isn't something that I've seen yet but I

02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:36,610
mean there are a lot of clever people

02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:39,280
out there and they're probably doing

02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:41,260
that and it would be great in the future

02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:43,480
if that were built into WordPress core

02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:47,770
but right now it's all something that's

02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:50,110
happening in the backend so it doesn't

02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:52,450
necessarily have to do with the theme

02:02:50,110 --> 02:02:56,770
development as much as WordPress itself

02:02:52,450 --> 02:03:00,130
before you even get that far and like

02:02:56,770 --> 02:03:01,720
for example in WordPress be of he like a

02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:03,340
lot of what we're doing is working with

02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:05,740
people with decoupled sites so they can

02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:07,990
use WordPress with the block editor and

02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:10,120
use that entirely only for the the back

02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:11,920
end of their website and then with some

02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:13,720
- coupled architecture build something

02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,100
entirely different for the front end and

02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:17,470
just not use the WordPress at all for

02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:18,700
that if they wanted to so that's

02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:22,470
definitely a possibility so they're

02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:22,470
really they can be very very separate

02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,850
are there any more questions at all

02:03:36,929 --> 02:03:42,000
okay if you come up with questions later

02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:43,500
on I'm very happy to take any in the

02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,449
hallway especially if you're not a big

02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:48,270
group question asker and you can also

02:03:45,449 --> 02:03:50,670
ask me questions on Twitter I'll be here

02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:53,130
all that's all day and also on Twitter

02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:55,340
today so please feel free if you have

02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:58,670
anything else you'd like to know about

02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:58,670
thank you very much

02:25:21,521 --> 02:25:27,320
um we just have a couple of

02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:28,671
announcements before we get started if

02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:33,110
everyone could just make sure their cell

02:25:28,671 --> 02:25:34,551
phones are turned off and if you if you

02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:36,620
want to move into the middle we have

02:25:34,551 --> 02:25:38,540
plenty of seating so that's not really a

02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:42,320
big deal right now if anyone comes in

02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:44,360
late after the presentation there will

02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:45,830
be a question and answer time so if you

02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,421
could please hold your questions until

02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:53,271
then we'll have someone go around with a

02:25:47,421 --> 02:25:55,280
microphone and also just a couple of

02:25:53,271 --> 02:25:57,771
reminders there's a contributor day on

02:25:55,280 --> 02:26:00,740
Sunday and everyone's invited we'd love

02:25:57,771 --> 02:26:02,601
to have you come and if you haven't

02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:04,610
picked up your t-shirts yet there are

02:26:02,601 --> 02:26:08,330
still shirts at the swag table

02:26:04,610 --> 02:26:10,400
downstairs in the sponsor room after

02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:13,551
this presentation there will be a lunch

02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:16,580
and I believe it's just downstairs at

02:26:13,551 --> 02:26:19,881
the bottom of the escalators so I think

02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:22,360
that is all of the announcements and

02:26:19,881 --> 02:26:25,190
we'd like to introduce Brian Thompson

02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:28,101
currently runs the web team at mine grub

02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:30,021
technologies a digital services agency

02:26:28,101 --> 02:26:32,690
in Baltimore specializing in WordPress

02:26:30,021 --> 02:26:34,820
websites his life consists of coding

02:26:32,690 --> 02:26:37,370
managing his team having some fun

02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:39,921
playing video games and going camping as

02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:41,900
far away from technology as possible he

02:26:39,921 --> 02:26:45,740
started working with WordPress in 2011

02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:48,591
as a sysadmin managing servers WordPress

02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:50,631
websites run on in 2012 he started

02:26:48,591 --> 02:26:53,540
learning WordPress development since

02:26:50,631 --> 02:26:55,070
2012 he's been promoted from intern to

02:26:53,540 --> 02:26:56,540
lead software engineer where he

02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:58,780
currently co manages the day-to-day

02:26:56,540 --> 02:27:01,131

WordPress websites and managed the

02:27:03,351 --> 02:27:06,620
websites and servers for high-profile

02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:08,540
websites such as those used during

02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:11,961
charity TV benefit concerts with

02:27:08,540 --> 02:27:14,650

Brian Thompson

02:27:18,270 --> 02:27:22,851
[Applause]

02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:25,311
good morning we're camp how's everybody

02:27:22,851 --> 02:27:26,601
doing this morning all right still a

02:27:25,311 --> 02:27:28,311
little tired from last night

02:27:26,601 --> 02:27:31,160
I know crawling through the tunnels

02:27:28,311 --> 02:27:33,620
we're we're tough Thank You Tiffany for

02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:35,750
the kind introduction when I was putting

02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:38,030
it together they asked me what they

02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:39,471
should say and I included something

02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:41,391
about everybody applauding as the lights

02:27:39,471 --> 02:27:43,130
started flashing like there was a TV

02:27:41,391 --> 02:27:45,500
show without realizing I was in a room

02:27:43,130 --> 02:27:47,750
with stage lighting and then I kind of

02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:50,080
freaked out when I walked in but as a

02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:52,790
manager you just roll with the punches

02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:54,440
so as Tiffany said my name is Brian

02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:55,910
Thompson I'm the director of web

02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:57,710
engineering at a company called mine

02:27:55,910 --> 02:28:00,800
grub located up in Baltimore where we do

02:27:57,710 --> 02:28:02,330
tons of open-source PHP work even before

02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:05,630
WordPress I was working with web

02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:07,641
technology back since 2006 when my

02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:09,351
middle school teacher asked me if I knew

02:28:07,641 --> 02:28:11,920
how to delete an icon off the Windows

02:28:09,351 --> 02:28:16,340
desktop I was exciting

02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:18,170
you can laugh that's okay been a

02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:19,971
developer for many many years even as a

02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:23,811
manager now I still try and find time to

02:28:19,971 --> 02:28:26,511
write code for a better or worse and I'm

02:28:23,811 --> 02:28:28,070
also on Twitter at conferences so my

02:28:26,511 --> 02:28:29,570
coworkers are sitting up in the front

02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:31,160
they always like to run pools when I

02:28:29,570 --> 02:28:33,050
speak at conferences as to how many

02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:37,580
Twitter followers I will get from my

02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:38,870
tops the current bar is six there's more

02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:40,641
than six of you out there in the

02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:45,110
audience I can see you even with the

02:28:40,641 --> 02:28:47,721
lighting just saying and as Tiffany said

02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:51,080
Baker outdoorsman and a general tech

02:28:47,721 --> 02:28:52,870
nerd so here we are imagine yourself

02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:55,130
sitting at WordCamp on Saturday

02:28:52,870 --> 02:28:57,130
listening to this great talk unaware of

02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:59,120
what next week will bring for you

02:28:57,130 --> 02:29:00,620
Monday morning rolls around you've

02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:02,630
traveled back to wherever it is in the

02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:04,880
world you're headed be that here in st.

02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:07,011
Louis another great city in the United

02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:10,160
States or abroad you're drinking your

02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:12,110
coffee in your wonderful WordPress mug

02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:14,360
which you got down from the sponsor area

02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:18,110
and your boss comes up to you and says

02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:22,130
congratulations you just leveled up and

02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:23,721
got promoted and as you're balancing

02:29:22,130 --> 02:29:25,460
that excitement with the need to

02:29:23,721 --> 02:29:26,660
continue drinking more coffee to

02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:28,220
actually realize and show that

02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:30,649
excitement

02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:33,819
all the sudden you realize that life as

02:29:30,649 --> 02:29:38,060
you know it where you normally live here

02:29:33,819 --> 02:29:43,180
writing code is about to change because

02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:47,180
as a manager I maybe open a code editor

02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:48,890
once a week twice a week if I get really

02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:51,050
lucky and we have a holiday where most

02:29:48,890 --> 02:29:52,550
of the company is out of the office like

02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:57,350
the day after Thanksgiving those sorts

02:29:52,550 --> 02:30:00,260
of things so what do you do and I say

02:29:57,350 --> 02:30:02,810
this having having it happened to me

02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:06,050
now I lived this life where I showed up

02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:08,209
for work one Monday morning and after

02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:10,249
previously being asked to write a job

02:30:08,209 --> 02:30:12,109
description for my job as a developer

02:30:10,249 --> 02:30:13,520
they say congratulations you can take

02:30:12,109 --> 02:30:15,709
that job description and pass it on to

02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:21,079
somebody else because you're now running

02:30:15,709 --> 02:30:24,529
the entire team it's a team of 35 plus

02:30:21,079 --> 02:30:27,489
web engineers who now all report in to

02:30:24,529 --> 02:30:29,510
you congratulations

02:30:27,489 --> 02:30:31,100
they're all awesome by the way

02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:34,939
especially those who are sitting right

02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:37,640
over there and so as I was thinking

02:30:34,939 --> 02:30:40,399
about it trying to figure out what do

02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:45,050
you do how do I write code to make them

02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:48,350
do what I want and then deal with the

02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:52,640
bugs that come from that I I realized I

02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:54,579
had to start somewhere simple and I had

02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:57,529
to go back to something that I knew

02:30:54,579 --> 02:30:59,810
fairly well and had done before and you

02:30:57,529 --> 02:31:01,399
know just a few weeks prior had been

02:30:59,810 --> 02:31:04,069
experiencing and that's relate

02:31:01,399 --> 02:31:06,800
management to something else and so just

02:31:04,069 --> 02:31:08,359
like I look at a coding problem and I'm

02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:10,760
trying to write something and I'm like I

02:31:08,359 --> 02:31:13,279
don't know how to do this how do I make

02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:16,520
this Stack Overflow answer look like

02:31:13,279 --> 02:31:19,939
what I need to do I've had to find an

02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:22,159
analogy for managing people and my

02:31:19,939 --> 02:31:24,560
answer to that was it's just like

02:31:22,159 --> 02:31:25,609
whitewater rafting by a show of hands

02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:28,699
how many people have been whitewater

02:31:25,609 --> 02:31:31,310
rafting before very good probably about

02:31:28,699 --> 02:31:32,749
20% of the room or so that's very

02:31:31,310 --> 02:31:34,609
impressive for those of you that haven't

02:31:32,749 --> 02:31:36,260
I highly encourage it there's nothing

02:31:34,609 --> 02:31:37,699
more fun than getting flipped upside

02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:41,090
down as you go down a waterfall

02:31:37,699 --> 02:31:42,020
out of a boat in chilling water it's a

02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:43,880
lot more fun when you get

02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:48,920
watch your friends do that and you're

02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:50,930
still sitting in the boat semi-dry and

02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:52,640
so as I thought about this and I figured

02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:53,810
out how do I want to get management into

02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:56,210
whitewater rafting

02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:58,550
I thought the very first thing that

02:31:56,210 --> 02:32:00,920
happens when you go on a whitewater

02:31:58,550 --> 02:32:04,550
rafting trip or you you start one of

02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:06,560
these excursions and that you get all

02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:08,750
your equipment you get the proper

02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:11,930
equipment and so when you go whitewater

02:32:08,750 --> 02:32:13,670
rafting they don't want you to die

02:32:11,930 --> 02:32:15,770
because that would be very bad for the

02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:17,930
press and so they give you these things

02:32:15,770 --> 02:32:19,250
like personal floatation devices so that

02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:21,439
even if you do get thrown out of the

02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:22,819
boat you come back up to surface level

02:32:21,439 --> 02:32:24,739
they give you a helmet to protect your

02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:27,050
head they give you a paddle so you can

02:32:24,739 --> 02:32:28,970
move along bailing buckets so that when

02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:31,010
inevitably you start to go underwater in

02:32:28,970 --> 02:32:34,340
your boat you can get rid of that and

02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:36,470
they give you a guide and so I started

02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:38,300
with this table of trying to find

02:32:36,470 --> 02:32:41,210
equivalent things in the management

02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:45,020
world that I would need what tools is it

02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:48,140
that I would I would focus on things

02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:50,449
like tasks tracking software how many

02:32:48,140 --> 02:32:54,069
people work out of a ticketing system

02:32:50,449 --> 02:32:56,859
for their work via Trello Atlassian JIRA

02:32:54,069 --> 02:32:59,899
any of the other numbers pivotal tracker

02:32:56,859 --> 02:33:01,729
almost everybody in the room how many

02:32:59,899 --> 02:33:03,140
people use one of those just to manage

02:33:01,729 --> 02:33:07,699
what they're doing in their day to day

02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:11,060
lives a couple maybe ten or so in the

02:33:07,699 --> 02:33:12,590
room so one of the things that I did as

02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:14,779
a manager is I was first getting started

02:33:12,590 --> 02:33:18,050
was I actually made a new task tracking

02:33:14,779 --> 02:33:19,989
board for myself and I started putting

02:33:18,050 --> 02:33:23,420
everything in it and ranking it with

02:33:19,989 --> 02:33:25,819
priorities as a manager you'll find that

02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:26,560
people like to throw things at you every

02:33:25,819 --> 02:33:29,000
which direction

02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:31,189
you might be walking to go get a snack

02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,750
from the break room you might be just

02:33:31,189 --> 02:33:33,859
trying to take five minutes outside to

02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:35,810
collect your thoughts and on the way you

02:33:33,859 --> 02:33:37,220
pass two people in the stairwell each of

02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:40,159
whom has something else they want you to

02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:42,050
do being able to take and manage that

02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:43,640
from my phone or if I'm sitting at my

02:33:42,050 --> 02:33:45,199
desk or even just shooting off an email

02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:47,899
to it to automatically create tickets

02:33:45,199 --> 02:33:50,149
for me helps keep track of everything it

02:33:47,899 --> 02:33:54,020
is I have to do I'm prioritizing that

02:33:50,149 --> 02:33:55,970
accordingly then I got into the world

02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:59,750
that comes from my bosses

02:33:55,970 --> 02:34:01,010
his boss also known as the CEO which is

02:33:59,750 --> 02:34:03,500
everything has to start with a

02:34:01,010 --> 02:34:05,420
spreadsheet doesn't matter what you're

02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:06,970
trying to do there should be a

02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:09,439
spreadsheet to track that information

02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:12,290
and so I took all of the information

02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:14,540
about my team I put them in a

02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:16,489
spreadsheet yes we had an HR tracking

02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:19,520
system it had fancy bells and whistles

02:34:16,489 --> 02:34:21,229
and whiz bangs and took a long time for

02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:23,750
each page to load and was awful to

02:34:21,229 --> 02:34:26,390
navigate and so I transferred all of

02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:28,250
that into into a spreadsheet where it's

02:34:26,390 --> 02:34:31,069
got everybody's name what their

02:34:28,250 --> 02:34:32,630
strengths are where they might need some

02:34:31,069 --> 02:34:35,330
help or things that might not be good

02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:37,130
for them puts their salary information

02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:38,479
in there since I'm now also responsible

02:34:37,130 --> 02:34:42,140
for making sure that these people get

02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:45,170
paid or at least get paid buy more here

02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:48,410
over here so I have all that information

02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:51,200
together and it's much easier to access

02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:53,810
and thanks to the miracle that is Google

02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:55,399
sheets I can also read that on my phone

02:34:53,810 --> 02:34:58,130
which means if I'm on the train or if

02:34:55,399 --> 02:34:59,390
I'm sitting at the airport on Sunday

02:34:58,130 --> 02:35:00,680
flying home from work camp I can

02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:05,720
actually pull that up and reference it

02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:08,689
for everybody on my team third I

02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:11,180
realized that I actually didn't have

02:35:08,689 --> 02:35:14,450
access to all of the things that I was

02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:15,890
now responsible for as part of receiving

02:35:14,450 --> 02:35:18,649
all these questions from people it's

02:35:15,890 --> 02:35:21,770
like hey we need to do this in this one

02:35:18,649 --> 02:35:24,229
website I don't know how to log in I

02:35:21,770 --> 02:35:28,040
don't have credentials I was focused on

02:35:24,229 --> 02:35:29,870
that other website over there and now

02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:32,029
you're asking me if I can go look at

02:35:29,870 --> 02:35:34,640
something or even better it's not a

02:35:32,029 --> 02:35:36,080
developer who's coming to me I'm having

02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:37,430
a project manager come to me because

02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:38,930
they're concerned with the way something

02:35:37,430 --> 02:35:41,479
looks and they want me to take a look at

02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:44,510
it before they push back one the

02:35:41,479 --> 02:35:45,439
developers they're working with there

02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:48,350
are a number of different password

02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:49,640
management tools out there what I would

02:35:48,350 --> 02:35:50,960
look for is one that lets you share

02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:53,899
easily with each other

02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:56,319
LastPass is very popular I used it for a

02:35:53,899 --> 02:35:59,450
while we've switched since switched to

02:35:56,319 --> 02:36:02,810
one password which I find to be a little

02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:04,850
nicer in their interface it connects to

02:36:02,810 --> 02:36:09,380
everything so whether I'm on my phone or

02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:10,040
my computer when my xbox at home I can

02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:13,970
still get to the

02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:16,310
words that I need the fourth one on the

02:36:13,970 --> 02:36:19,100
list is the one that I didn't really

02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:20,540
think I needed until I needed it and is

02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:22,280
the one that nobody will ever invest

02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:24,710
time and despite how much I talk about

02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:27,470
it and despite me giving you this

02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:31,550
warning and that's what I call

02:36:27,470 --> 02:36:36,170
escalation playbooks been a manager now

02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:40,970
for three and a half four years and over

02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:43,820
that time things have gone wrong clients

02:36:40,970 --> 02:36:46,610
sites have gone down people from my

02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:48,200
development team have gotten sick or

02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:53,660
told me they're sick at inopportune

02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:57,230
times or just it's a holiday and the

02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:59,120
company is closed but that client who

02:36:57,230 --> 02:37:00,970
was allowed to enter HTML into their

02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:03,260
website managed to introduce a

02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:05,660
cross-site scripting vulnerability or

02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:08,750
some other problem as they copy pasted

02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:12,160
from one site to the next and after a

02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:15,980
couple of times of trying to figure out

02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:18,771
what to do and think on the fly while

02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,540
I'm in Disneyworld sitting down to

02:37:18,771 --> 02:37:22,100
dinner with my family and my phones

02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:27,490
blowing up because I need to have this

02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:30,021
addressed my boss and mentor at the time

02:37:27,490 --> 02:37:32,090
said I've told you to write things down

02:37:30,021 --> 02:37:36,590
before why haven't you made an

02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:38,150
escalation playbook and that got me back

02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:40,010
into the spreadsheet world and I created

02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:42,890
a task in my task tracking software to

02:37:40,010 --> 02:37:46,820
put all this together and over the past

02:37:42,890 --> 02:37:49,310
three years four years it's become

02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:55,010
fairly robust in how to deal with

02:37:49,310 --> 02:37:56,271
situations when they go wrong and it's

02:37:55,010 --> 02:37:58,580
not something I really share I don't

02:37:56,271 --> 02:38:01,370
even think anybody on my team has have

02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:04,130
seen my part of it because it includes

02:38:01,370 --> 02:38:07,490
notes to me about when should I get

02:38:04,130 --> 02:38:08,840
involved as a manager you have all these

02:38:07,490 --> 02:38:11,810
different things coming your direction

02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:13,220
and just because something is on fire

02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:16,550
doesn't mean you're the one who has to

02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:18,950
throw a bucket of water on it you also

02:38:16,550 --> 02:38:20,240
shouldn't pour gasoline on it but

02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:21,860
sometimes you have to let people on your

02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:23,069
team do things and so I include notes to

02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:26,279
myself about

02:38:23,069 --> 02:38:27,689
different situations people are asking

02:38:26,279 --> 02:38:29,479
Brian how do you how do you classify

02:38:27,689 --> 02:38:33,749
whether you should get involved or not

02:38:29,479 --> 02:38:36,270
and I'm reminded of a saying when I was

02:38:33,749 --> 02:38:40,159
taking leadership training in high

02:38:36,270 --> 02:38:42,569
school if somebody comes to you and asks

02:38:40,159 --> 02:38:45,149
where do they find the cups in the

02:38:42,569 --> 02:38:48,449
office to be able to get a cup of coffee

02:38:45,149 --> 02:38:50,029
in the morning as a manager that's not

02:38:48,449 --> 02:38:52,379
necessarily a question I need to answer

02:38:50,029 --> 02:38:55,559
I'm better off directing them to

02:38:52,379 --> 02:38:58,049
somebody else if somebody comes to me

02:38:55,559 --> 02:39:00,449
and instead of asking for cups they're

02:38:58,049 --> 02:39:01,829
asking where the band-aids are because

02:39:00,449 --> 02:39:03,059
somebody just sliced their finger off

02:39:01,829 --> 02:39:05,219
while they were trying to cut a bagel

02:39:03,059 --> 02:39:07,919
for breakfast that's a situation I

02:39:05,219 --> 02:39:09,919
should get involved in and so figuring

02:39:07,919 --> 02:39:13,409
that out and equating it to technology

02:39:09,919 --> 02:39:15,799
clients sight being down I need to be

02:39:13,409 --> 02:39:18,270
more aware of client is upset because

02:39:15,799 --> 02:39:19,619
the content on their website is wrong

02:39:18,270 --> 02:39:21,089
and they haven't figured out how to go

02:39:19,619 --> 02:39:22,499
into the WordPress admin panel and

02:39:21,089 --> 02:39:27,509
change it despite three or four

02:39:22,499 --> 02:39:29,689
trainings or 30 or 40 I don't

02:39:27,509 --> 02:39:32,789
necessarily need to get involved in that

02:39:29,689 --> 02:39:34,439
but that said we do include in our work

02:39:32,789 --> 02:39:36,539
escalation playbooks that I think will

02:39:34,439 --> 02:39:38,429
apply to all of you that we do share

02:39:36,539 --> 02:39:43,589
with everybody else on the team and is

02:39:38,429 --> 02:39:46,770
right there for people and they answer

02:39:43,589 --> 02:39:49,109
questions like what happens when your

02:39:46,770 --> 02:39:50,399
clients site goes down or more

02:39:49,109 --> 02:39:51,989
importantly what happens when the

02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:55,669
developer working on the project goes on

02:39:51,989 --> 02:39:59,489
vacation and I don't want to call them

02:39:55,669 --> 02:40:01,639
or what happens when I'm on vacation and

02:39:59,489 --> 02:40:07,319
it's a site that I've actually built and

02:40:01,639 --> 02:40:09,239
that manifests itself as the readme how

02:40:07,319 --> 02:40:12,569
many people change the readme that ships

02:40:09,239 --> 02:40:14,819
with their WordPress websites not very

02:40:12,569 --> 02:40:16,679
many people we're talking maybe four or

02:40:14,819 --> 02:40:21,089
five especially if I include my team who

02:40:16,679 --> 02:40:24,779
should have their hands up so when we

02:40:21,089 --> 02:40:26,579
get into website development we

02:40:24,779 --> 02:40:28,770
instituted a rule that every site has to

02:40:26,579 --> 02:40:31,439
have it read me so that when there's a

02:40:28,770 --> 02:40:32,819
fire and you're on vacation or you're

02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:35,549
the developer working when it is on

02:40:32,819 --> 02:40:36,960
vacation we have the information we need

02:40:35,549 --> 02:40:39,090
to be able to help

02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:41,270
as a manager I can get involved in help

02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:43,739
another developer can get involved or

02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:45,750
even if I just need to put another

02:40:43,739 --> 02:40:47,370
developer on the project if I take into

02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:50,189
that big long readme and I start to zoom

02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:52,199
into it some you can see that it

02:40:50,189 --> 02:40:54,569
includes things like the site name and

02:40:52,199 --> 02:40:56,630
while I've edited it out of this

02:40:54,569 --> 02:41:00,229
screenshot because i source our eyes

02:40:56,630 --> 02:41:02,880
took a screenshot of it from our actual

02:41:00,229 --> 02:41:04,529
source control repository it also

02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:07,979
includes a description as to what this

02:41:04,529 --> 02:41:10,050
site is and why a client has hired us to

02:41:07,979 --> 02:41:12,890
build it for them what do they see as

02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:16,350
the priorities it includes things like

02:41:12,890 --> 02:41:18,029
how to set this up to run locally if I

02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:20,370
need to get it running on my laptop what

02:41:18,029 --> 02:41:22,680
are all of the different steps is it

02:41:20,370 --> 02:41:25,560
more complex than just pulling the code

02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:28,380
down and adding a database to it do I

02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:31,890
need to change certain configuration

02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:33,449
settings is there an additional service

02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:36,210
that it integrates with that I need to

02:41:33,449 --> 02:41:38,160
worry about if I'm not developing

02:41:36,210 --> 02:41:40,470
locally where are the other environments

02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:43,020
if I need to look at the staging website

02:41:40,470 --> 02:41:45,060
or the development website what are the

02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:50,000
links to them how do I find them how can

02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:52,890
I get there and most importantly to me

02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:55,439
how do I ship changes to that customers

02:41:52,890 --> 02:41:58,310
website there are a number of times

02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:00,870
where I've been pulled into a fire

02:41:58,310 --> 02:42:05,420
developers been on vacation I got

02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:07,050
involved I have a fix it was two lines

02:42:05,420 --> 02:42:10,920
not that big a deal

02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:13,020
it took me 30 minutes or so to to get

02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:14,220
there and I then spend the next hour and

02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:16,140
a half trying to figure out how to

02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:19,979
actually fix the clients live site and

02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:22,350
ship this code to them because I don't

02:42:19,979 --> 02:42:24,600
know how to get that code to their

02:42:22,350 --> 02:42:27,000
production server and even if you're

02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:28,680
using one of the hosting providers that

02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,260
manages all of that for you and you're

02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:34,140
not using a cloud server there's still a

02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:35,880
process how do we have access to it do I

02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:37,739
need to be using a particular account

02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:42,000
because the client gave access to just

02:42:37,739 --> 02:42:47,399
one account we also list out every

02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:48,750
single integration that a website has so

02:42:47,399 --> 02:42:50,790
that if the client is complaining about

02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:52,770
their contact form giving an error

02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:54,270
I can actually look at that or anybody

02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:56,160
on the team can look at that and say

02:42:54,270 --> 02:42:59,310
well this site is integrated with

02:42:56,160 --> 02:43:02,760
HubSpot and all of the form submissions

02:42:59,310 --> 02:43:04,229
are going there is HubSpot down there

02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:07,200
down in the sponsor area I'm sure that

02:43:04,229 --> 02:43:10,160
would never happen to their system their

02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:12,210
Status page might say otherwise but

02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:14,729
figuring out what those different pieces

02:43:12,210 --> 02:43:17,010
are and on top of that we might even

02:43:14,729 --> 02:43:19,080
link to further documentation I know

02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:21,300
it's small on the screen but in the in

02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:22,680
the themes section we actually point out

02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:25,950
that there's additional documentation

02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:28,500
for the WordPress theme that we built in

02:43:25,950 --> 02:43:31,680
the specific theme directory things like

02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:34,319
how do I compile this sass files down to

02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:39,180
CSS are there other steps that I need to

02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:41,970
take and this goes one and on and on and

02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:42,930
it seems cumbersome to write and it

02:43:41,970 --> 02:43:47,069
seems like it's going to be very

02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:49,979
time-consuming but if you start making a

02:43:47,069 --> 02:43:51,600
habit of it you start to get into a lot

02:43:49,979 --> 02:43:54,660
of copy-paste between things and you

02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:57,260
have a template and ultimately would you

02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:59,340
rather spend an extra 30 minutes now

02:43:57,260 --> 02:44:02,250
where would you like to spend 30 minutes

02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:08,189
while the client is yelling at you that

02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:11,310
there's a problem with their website on

02:44:08,189 --> 02:44:14,220
top of that as a manager you get into

02:44:11,310 --> 02:44:16,979
these situations where everybody's got

02:44:14,220 --> 02:44:18,359
their paddle out of the water except for

02:44:16,979 --> 02:44:20,310
the guide in the back that's the boss

02:44:18,359 --> 02:44:24,149
because he's the manager and he

02:44:20,310 --> 02:44:27,420
understands that going with the flow can

02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:29,370
actually be semi dangerous when they

02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:31,170
when you go whitewater rafting and

02:44:29,370 --> 02:44:33,359
you're getting the briefing before you

02:44:31,170 --> 02:44:34,800
actually put your boat in the water they

02:44:33,359 --> 02:44:37,380
tell you that you either need to go

02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:40,290
faster than the water or you need to go

02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:42,330
slower than the water but you should

02:44:40,290 --> 02:44:44,819
never go at the same speed of the actual

02:44:42,330 --> 02:44:46,290
water if you're in your boats and you're

02:44:44,819 --> 02:44:48,600
going at the same speed the water is

02:44:46,290 --> 02:44:52,850
going then the water is in control and

02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:57,479
you are not in the same thing goes for

02:44:52,850 --> 02:45:00,720
managing in some cases you need to be

02:44:57,479 --> 02:45:02,640
faster than your projects or your people

02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:04,020
you need to be ahead of them figuring

02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:09,199
things out

02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:11,789
in other cases you need to go slower

02:45:09,199 --> 02:45:13,020
you're saying Brian I'm the manager why

02:45:11,789 --> 02:45:14,939
should I be going slower than everybody

02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:16,619
else it's because you need to give other

02:45:14,939 --> 02:45:17,909
people a chance to solve problems you're

02:45:16,619 --> 02:45:21,810
not going to be able to solve all of

02:45:17,909 --> 02:45:25,709
them I might not know specifically how

02:45:21,810 --> 02:45:28,589
to integrate b-hat testing with my

02:45:25,709 --> 02:45:30,959
wordpress website I could go faster and

02:45:28,589 --> 02:45:33,140
I could figure that out or I could go

02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:35,939
slower and let somebody from my team

02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:38,159
have that opportunity to be the expert

02:45:35,939 --> 02:45:40,589
on it by going slower and letting them

02:45:38,159 --> 02:45:42,600
be the expert I now save myself in the

02:45:40,589 --> 02:45:46,739
future from having all the questions

02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:50,869
come to me I can pass those questions to

02:45:46,739 --> 02:45:52,949
someone else but no matter what you do

02:45:50,869 --> 02:45:56,579
don't go at the same speed of your

02:45:52,949 --> 02:45:57,959
projects or your people when you go at

02:45:56,579 --> 02:45:59,999
the same speed of your projects and your

02:45:57,959 --> 02:46:01,949
people you're at the same level of your

02:45:59,999 --> 02:46:03,869
developers you're at the same level of

02:46:01,949 --> 02:46:06,149
everybody else and they will take you

02:46:03,869 --> 02:46:12,779
along for the ride instead of you being

02:46:06,149 --> 02:46:14,310
in control so it's fun finding all these

02:46:12,779 --> 02:46:17,609
whitewater rafting pictures as I went

02:46:14,310 --> 02:46:19,680
along you'll notice that this boat is

02:46:17,609 --> 02:46:22,770
kind of sideways as it goes down the

02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:24,839
water sometimes that might be considered

02:46:22,770 --> 02:46:26,100
a problem it's always fun to go

02:46:24,839 --> 02:46:27,600
whitewater rafting with new people

02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:30,029
because this would be the point when

02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:31,859
panic is setting in in the boat and

02:46:30,029 --> 02:46:33,359
people are trying to do their own thing

02:46:31,859 --> 02:46:35,390
to get things circled around so that

02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:40,470
they're pointed in the right direction

02:46:35,390 --> 02:46:42,270
as a manager we have to get very

02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:46,350
comfortable with not always being

02:46:42,270 --> 02:46:48,899
pointed straight downstream going

02:46:46,350 --> 02:46:51,209
forward is good it's actually quite

02:46:48,899 --> 02:46:52,970
great but as a manager you'll find that

02:46:51,209 --> 02:46:55,199
going backwards is actually quite common

02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:58,499
things won't be smooth you won't be able

02:46:55,199 --> 02:46:59,879
to see where you're going and you're

02:46:58,499 --> 02:47:02,879
gonna have to sort of go with the fun

02:46:59,879 --> 02:47:05,759
into things as you back yourself into it

02:47:02,879 --> 02:47:08,189
I always shoot for going into something

02:47:05,759 --> 02:47:12,359
sideways I'm willing to go in sideways

02:47:08,189 --> 02:47:14,779
knowing most but not everything some

02:47:12,359 --> 02:47:17,681
situations I do walk into with a plan

02:47:14,779 --> 02:47:21,190
most situations I walk into

02:47:17,681 --> 02:47:23,051
knowing what the problem is and having

02:47:21,190 --> 02:47:26,110
some ideas but not fully having fleshed

02:47:23,051 --> 02:47:28,811
out that solution there is one key to

02:47:26,110 --> 02:47:30,311
all of this though even if you're going

02:47:28,811 --> 02:47:33,431
in sideways or you're going into a

02:47:30,311 --> 02:47:35,021
situation backwards always make sure

02:47:33,431 --> 02:47:37,450
you're looking in the direction you want

02:47:35,021 --> 02:47:39,670
to go so as people are coming to you and

02:47:37,450 --> 02:47:41,920
you're trying to solve problems keep

02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:44,311
your eye on where you want to be at the

02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:46,330
end six months a year down the road

02:47:44,311 --> 02:47:52,360
making sure that you're working that

02:47:46,330 --> 02:47:55,061
direction now in addition to not always

02:47:52,360 --> 02:47:57,971
going forward there are also sometimes

02:47:55,061 --> 02:47:59,950
some big rocks in the way this is

02:47:57,971 --> 02:48:04,811
actually a giant rock as you go

02:47:59,950 --> 02:48:08,410
whitewater rafting and that's okay as a

02:48:04,811 --> 02:48:10,061
manager we can't be afraid to do what we

02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:13,721
call in the whitewater rafting industry

02:48:10,061 --> 02:48:16,631
a bump now when you go whitewater

02:48:13,721 --> 02:48:20,200
rafting they tell you as you come into

02:48:16,631 --> 02:48:22,091
this Rock instinct will take over and

02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:25,931
everyone will try and stay far away from

02:48:22,091 --> 02:48:27,790
it as developers we're like well that's

02:48:25,931 --> 02:48:30,131
scary over there let's stay away from

02:48:27,790 --> 02:48:32,440
that let's not deal with that problem

02:48:30,131 --> 02:48:34,931
right now that's a big rock we want to

02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:36,881
stay away for those of you that have

02:48:34,931 --> 02:48:37,990
gone whitewater rafting before many of

02:48:36,881 --> 02:48:39,610
you have probably learned that as

02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:41,860
everybody scrambles to get away from the

02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:44,740
rock the rock then flips your boat

02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:47,051
upside down now you're out of the boat

02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:49,181
and you have a big problem instead what

02:48:47,051 --> 02:48:53,221
they tell you to do is to actually lean

02:48:49,181 --> 02:48:55,360
into the hazard and so as you encounter

02:48:53,221 --> 02:48:58,051
scenarios and you have those big rocks

02:48:55,360 --> 02:49:01,721
in the development and management world

02:48:58,051 --> 02:49:05,110
lean into them so that you can bounce

02:49:01,721 --> 02:49:08,170
off instead of letting them flip you

02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:10,841
upside down trying to shy away from

02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:14,500
something or hide from it is only a

02:49:10,841 --> 02:49:17,460
problem in the future and might become a

02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:17,460
very quick future

02:49:19,510 --> 02:49:25,520
even with all of this as a manager I

02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:31,790
would be you in the very back of the

02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:37,069
boat with a white helmet one trying to

02:49:31,790 --> 02:49:40,220
give direction how many people have been

02:49:37,069 --> 02:49:41,569
in a situation before we're only half

02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:44,449
the boat has had to paddle while they

02:49:41,569 --> 02:49:45,470
wait water raft that's a great feeling

02:49:44,449 --> 02:49:46,760
when you're on the other side and you're

02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:49,960
just sitting in the long for the ride

02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:53,500
and everybody else is going forward as

02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:57,380
managers you have to figure out when

02:49:53,500 --> 02:50:00,949
only certain people need to paddle and

02:49:57,380 --> 02:50:04,370
by that I mean when some people need to

02:50:00,949 --> 02:50:06,680
work harder and some people can coast a

02:50:04,370 --> 02:50:08,210
little bit I think one of the big

02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:10,460
challenges I faced as a manager in the

02:50:08,210 --> 02:50:14,569
agency world that many of you might face

02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:17,960
is you have that big project and it

02:50:14,569 --> 02:50:20,180
launches being able to let the

02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:21,649
developers on that project coast just a

02:50:20,180 --> 02:50:26,000
little bit before they jump into the

02:50:21,649 --> 02:50:27,680
next one it doesn't always work but

02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,420
having some people and knowing when some

02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:32,689
things need to push hard and when some

02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:35,540
things it's okay to let us take a rest

02:50:32,689 --> 02:50:38,660
in a breather for a moment and let

02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:40,069
people collect their thoughts and and

02:50:38,660 --> 02:50:46,699
come together and have some personal

02:50:40,069 --> 02:50:49,880
time this is my favorite white water

02:50:46,699 --> 02:50:52,699
rafting picture you notice there are

02:50:49,880 --> 02:50:54,680
feet near the top of the picture that's

02:50:52,699 --> 02:50:57,290
not because I flipped it around this was

02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:59,000
the correct orientation there are a

02:50:57,290 --> 02:51:00,410
number of people who are currently have

02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,300
their heads underwater in their feet

02:51:00,410 --> 02:51:03,410
above water that's never good when

02:51:02,300 --> 02:51:07,850
you're whitewater rafting

02:51:03,410 --> 02:51:09,500
luckily they have helmets one as a

02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:13,010
manager or when you're whitewater

02:51:09,500 --> 02:51:16,370
rafting in your boat flips over you have

02:51:13,010 --> 02:51:20,810
to deal with adversity as a manager it's

02:51:16,370 --> 02:51:24,910
one of the most difficult things to deal

02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:27,140
with because things won't always go well

02:51:24,910 --> 02:51:29,149
despite everything I've told you thus

02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:32,119
far and all of my escalation playbooks

02:51:29,149 --> 02:51:34,189
in my JIRA project in my spreadsheets

02:51:32,119 --> 02:51:40,249
and my mentor and my boss and everybody

02:51:34,189 --> 02:51:42,229
else things still go wrong and you're

02:51:40,249 --> 02:51:43,699
gonna have some bad days and you're

02:51:42,229 --> 02:51:47,119
gonna have some bad days where you get

02:51:43,699 --> 02:51:52,399
home you're like well that was awful I

02:51:47,119 --> 02:51:56,839
don't want to do that again and every

02:51:52,399 --> 02:51:58,879
time that happens it's always important

02:51:56,839 --> 02:52:01,069
to bounce back up what happened

02:51:58,879 --> 02:52:04,939
yesterday hopefully won't happen

02:52:01,069 --> 02:52:07,899
tomorrow it's a new day and you'll be

02:52:04,939 --> 02:52:07,899
doing something different

02:52:07,989 --> 02:52:13,119
similarly when you're whitewater rafting

02:52:10,969 --> 02:52:16,520
sometimes you get thrown out of the boat

02:52:13,119 --> 02:52:18,889
and the one thing they tell you when you

02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:23,659
get thrown out of the boat and you start

02:52:18,889 --> 02:52:27,229
floating is always keep your feet

02:52:23,659 --> 02:52:29,479
pointed downstream don't lead with your

02:52:27,229 --> 02:52:33,189
head because hitting your head on a rock

02:52:29,479 --> 02:52:38,029
would be painful lead with your feet

02:52:33,189 --> 02:52:41,689
keep your feet together and just ride it

02:52:38,029 --> 02:52:43,219
out as you go along everybody's first

02:52:41,689 --> 02:52:44,449
instinct as soon as they get out of the

02:52:43,219 --> 02:52:46,969
boat and they get their feet pointed the

02:52:44,449 --> 02:52:49,339
right direction is to jump back in the

02:52:46,969 --> 02:52:50,869
boat despite the fact that we're going

02:52:49,339 --> 02:52:53,359
through class-4 Rapids and the boats

02:52:50,869 --> 02:52:57,979
about to flip upside-down they want us

02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:59,719
to stop recognize that you can't always

02:52:57,979 --> 02:53:02,949
get back to the comfort of the raft

02:52:59,719 --> 02:53:05,719
right away if things are going wrong

02:53:02,949 --> 02:53:08,270
tomorrow is a new day it will certainly

02:53:05,719 --> 02:53:13,249
be different than the day before it

02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:14,569
might not be perfect but keep yourself

02:53:13,249 --> 02:53:17,060
pointed in the right direction so that

02:53:14,569 --> 02:53:23,770
you can get back in the raft once things

02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:27,379
calm down on top of all of that we have

02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:33,079
what every manager loves at the very

02:53:27,379 --> 02:53:34,429
very best saying no it's like when

02:53:33,079 --> 02:53:35,629
you're whitewater rafting boat decides

02:53:34,429 --> 02:53:38,689
they want to go down the 30-foot

02:53:35,629 --> 02:53:40,699
waterfall that picture is also oriented

02:53:38,689 --> 02:53:42,669
the correct way you'll notice the boat

02:53:40,699 --> 02:53:44,659
boat is pointed nearly straight down

02:53:42,669 --> 02:53:45,130
apparently this is a big thing for

02:53:44,659 --> 02:53:46,870
people

02:53:45,130 --> 02:53:48,970
whitewater rafting to do is to travel

02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:51,100
around the world to these 30-foot

02:53:48,970 --> 02:53:55,960
waterfalls where they can go face-first

02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:58,030
into the water and sometimes but that

02:53:55,960 --> 02:54:02,649
just seems like such a bad idea and so

02:53:58,030 --> 02:54:10,380
you have to say no as a manager saying

02:54:02,649 --> 02:54:13,600
though is painful we don't like doing it

02:54:10,380 --> 02:54:19,540
and so the first thing is to always give

02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:21,880
a reason the team that I manage my

02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:24,040
development team can actually tell when

02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:25,360
I'm jokingly telling them no because

02:54:24,040 --> 02:54:30,160
I'll tell them no and then just walk

02:54:25,360 --> 02:54:32,080
away without giving a reason but it goes

02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:36,300
over much differently if I say no we

02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:41,350
can't do that right now because X Y or Z

02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:44,970
it also helps them understand on top of

02:54:41,350 --> 02:54:48,870
that don't apologize

02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:52,750
saying sorry as you're telling them no

02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:56,229
just diminished the impact of your

02:54:52,750 --> 02:55:01,180
answer more so than keeping you in

02:54:56,229 --> 02:55:03,250
control in being in charge you don't

02:55:01,180 --> 02:55:05,439
have always have to have them like your

02:55:03,250 --> 02:55:08,380
decision they don't have to agree with

02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:13,420
it but it's your decision to make

02:55:08,380 --> 02:55:16,360
there's no need to apologize for it on

02:55:13,420 --> 02:55:17,910
top of that provide feedback why am I

02:55:16,360 --> 02:55:21,250
getting this question in the first place

02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:25,600
is there something that I can educate

02:55:21,250 --> 02:55:28,200
them around maybe as a manager you're in

02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:31,080
charge of compensation for your team

02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:35,770
when somebody comes to you asking for a

02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:40,300
raise I put all of these in practice so

02:55:35,770 --> 02:55:43,780
far I say no I don't think your

02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:46,750
performance is that great or the budget

02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:49,300
right now doesn't allow for us to to

02:55:46,750 --> 02:55:52,420
give out raises we're trying to collect

02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:55,780
our nuts as my boss likes to say and

02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:57,961
then I can provide feedback I think you

02:55:55,780 --> 02:56:01,650
could do better jobs here or there

02:55:57,961 --> 02:56:02,791
to change that answer or I could provide

02:56:01,650 --> 02:56:06,030
feedback around

02:56:02,791 --> 02:56:10,280
oh no the way our compensation strategy

02:56:06,030 --> 02:56:12,841
works is we only give out raises in June

02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:14,400
let's have this conversation then here

02:56:12,841 --> 02:56:19,801
are the things to focus on as we lead up

02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:24,990
to that time so that you can set

02:56:19,801 --> 02:56:26,581
yourself up for success then on top of

02:56:24,990 --> 02:56:28,200
all of that I also like to try and cut

02:56:26,581 --> 02:56:30,661
these questions off before I get them

02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:33,570
and making sure that that information is

02:56:30,661 --> 02:56:36,411
front and center for people somebody's

02:56:33,570 --> 02:56:40,860
asking me hey can we use this new

02:56:36,411 --> 02:56:43,110
hosting provider I've already set the

02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:47,011
boundaries and the expectations that as

02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:50,661
an agency we host all of our websites on

02:56:47,011 --> 02:56:57,751
Pantheon and that is the norm

02:56:50,661 --> 02:57:00,271
that's where everything lives but most

02:56:57,751 --> 02:57:02,641
importantly of all while this might seem

02:57:00,271 --> 02:57:04,230
very dire and everybody is like I'd like

02:57:02,641 --> 02:57:07,681
to get back to writing my code now I

02:57:04,230 --> 02:57:11,131
never want to deal with people what you

02:57:07,681 --> 02:57:14,041
should remember is that despite how bad

02:57:11,131 --> 02:57:17,030
it seems have fun with what you're doing

02:57:14,041 --> 02:57:19,621
and see the positive sides of everything

02:57:17,030 --> 02:57:22,771
put a smile on your face even though

02:57:19,621 --> 02:57:24,121
water is crashing over the boat everyone

02:57:22,771 --> 02:57:26,610
in the picture is smiling they're

02:57:24,121 --> 02:57:29,551
dripping wet looks pretty cold in the

02:57:26,610 --> 02:57:32,940
picture of those people whitewater

02:57:29,551 --> 02:57:35,311
rafting but everybody is happy and

02:57:32,940 --> 02:57:38,070
everybody's having a good time even if

02:57:35,311 --> 02:57:42,091
in the moment they might think they're

02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:44,280
not with that I'll open the floor up for

02:57:42,091 --> 02:57:47,011
questions I think a couple of people

02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:48,661
have mics that they'll run around so if

02:57:47,011 --> 02:57:52,730
you want to raise your hand you've got

02:57:48,661 --> 02:57:56,211
at least one here and one back there

02:57:52,730 --> 02:57:56,211
that I can see

02:57:59,811 --> 02:58:02,440
maybe

02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:10,000
we'll come back to you yes sir hello

02:58:07,960 --> 02:58:12,040
hello hello yes hi

02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:15,400
I was wondering you said that you start

02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:17,590
off with a spreadsheet to prioritize and

02:58:15,400 --> 02:58:19,090
list all of your tasks and then I was

02:58:17,590 --> 02:58:21,820
wondering what is your process from

02:58:19,090 --> 02:58:24,340
going to the spreadsheet to assigning a

02:58:21,820 --> 02:58:26,110
task to cracking it to making sure it's

02:58:24,340 --> 02:58:28,120
complete and making sure your team knows

02:58:26,110 --> 02:58:30,010
what they're supposed to be doing what

02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:32,320
the priorities are because there's you

02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:34,510
know there's a lot going on there most

02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:38,680
definitely and there's definitely a lot

02:58:34,510 --> 02:58:40,390
of pieces moving back and forth so the

02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:42,400
first part of it is is that I try not to

02:58:40,390 --> 02:58:45,880
get involved too much in the day-to-day

02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:47,771
tasking of the team and so while I might

02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:50,710
have access to everything that's listed

02:58:47,771 --> 02:58:52,170
for them their priorities I let the

02:58:50,710 --> 02:58:54,790
project management team and the

02:58:52,170 --> 02:58:57,250
developers under me at my lead

02:58:54,790 --> 02:59:00,120
developers handle personally of what I

02:58:57,250 --> 02:59:03,550
do for my tracking is I try and classify

02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:05,920
things into what's been talked about

02:59:03,550 --> 02:59:07,750
before is something that is urgent or

02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:10,840
something that is important or something

02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:12,970
that is both and figuring out which of

02:59:10,840 --> 02:59:14,620
those bubble to the top so at the start

02:59:12,970 --> 02:59:17,740
of my day each morning I look at what's

02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:21,340
one my list of what I would consider top

02:59:17,740 --> 02:59:22,510
10 things and I look to classify them

02:59:21,340 --> 02:59:26,230
how many of them need to get done right

02:59:22,510 --> 02:59:28,271
away and how many of them are important

02:59:26,230 --> 02:59:31,030
and then I try and spend my time on

02:59:28,271 --> 02:59:34,180
those that are both some things that

02:59:31,030 --> 02:59:40,840
might be urgent aren't necessarily

02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:43,300
important things like refilling the sack

02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:45,040
container which somehow falls on my list

02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:48,160
of responsibilities is like it's empty

02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:50,860
it's urgent that I refill it but it's

02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:52,900
not important and so therefore it gets

02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:56,370
deep prioritized slightly when the

02:59:52,900 --> 03:00:00,070
flipside something that is important

02:59:56,370 --> 03:00:05,140
would be booking my travel

03:00:00,070 --> 03:00:06,820
accommodations for WordCamp 2020 not

03:00:05,140 --> 03:00:08,320
urgent in the slightest so while it's

03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:10,271
important to get that done so that I get

03:00:08,320 --> 03:00:12,220
the best rates and I can pick the

03:00:10,271 --> 03:00:14,170
cheapest flights and so forth it's not

03:00:12,220 --> 03:00:15,910
urgent to do right now and so where

03:00:14,170 --> 03:00:18,129
those intersect of things that are

03:00:15,910 --> 03:00:24,020
urgent and things that are important

03:00:18,129 --> 03:00:25,550
addressing an issue with a client site

03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:27,829
that I have somebody on my team working

03:00:25,550 --> 03:00:29,449
one but I need to make sure it gets out

03:00:27,829 --> 03:00:31,520
the door today because the client has a

03:00:29,449 --> 03:00:40,069
big press conference tomorrow about it

03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:42,229
that's how I focus my time hello I'm

03:00:40,069 --> 03:00:45,949
Colin Hughes I'm a manager of a small

03:00:42,229 --> 03:00:47,449
product team at Oracle um hey one of the

03:00:45,949 --> 03:00:48,859
biggest challenges for me when I moved

03:00:47,449 --> 03:00:51,050
from an individual contributor to a

03:00:48,859 --> 03:00:53,749
manager was assuming the role of a

03:00:51,050 --> 03:00:55,760
mentor and a coach I imagine that

03:00:53,749 --> 03:00:58,970
challenge was even harder for you going

03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:02,300
from a single person to a owner of a

03:00:58,970 --> 03:01:04,640
team of 35 or so people how do you

03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:07,520
establish meaningful touch points with

03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:09,649
that many people it's a fantastic

03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:12,140
question how do i establish meaningful

03:01:09,649 --> 03:01:17,109
touch points and how do i a mentor and

03:01:12,140 --> 03:01:20,739
guide them so the first part of it is i

03:01:17,109 --> 03:01:24,770
try and do more walk arounds and just

03:01:20,739 --> 03:01:26,779
make myself available for a while when i

03:01:24,770 --> 03:01:28,640
first started i had this mindset that i

03:01:26,779 --> 03:01:30,050
was going to be this awesome manager and

03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:34,189
i was going to meet with everybody on my

03:01:30,050 --> 03:01:36,169
team every week for 15 minutes when you

03:01:34,189 --> 03:01:39,079
try and schedule 15 1 or 15-minute

03:01:36,169 --> 03:01:42,260
one-on-ones with 35 people there just

03:01:39,079 --> 03:01:44,839
went my Monday and Tuesday in half of

03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:48,109
Wednesday and so I scaled back from that

03:01:44,839 --> 03:01:50,239
and adjusted it so I met every other

03:01:48,109 --> 03:01:52,819
week and then I also put a couple other

03:01:50,239 --> 03:01:54,680
people and divvied them up so that not

03:01:52,819 --> 03:01:58,640
all 35 of them were coming to me

03:01:54,680 --> 03:02:01,609
directly for more mentorship in

03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:04,270
day-to-day guidance the other half of

03:02:01,609 --> 03:02:07,300
that is I try very hard to separate

03:02:04,270 --> 03:02:12,350
being a mentor versus being a manager

03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:14,479
and so it is my belief that mentor

03:02:12,350 --> 03:02:17,300
mentee relationship happens outside of

03:02:14,479 --> 03:02:18,919
management I have to want to be a mentor

03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:22,640
to somebody they have to want to men

03:02:18,919 --> 03:02:24,289
want me to be their mentor and so for

03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:26,239
all of the people on my team I might

03:02:24,289 --> 03:02:29,029
give guidance to them or I might give

03:02:26,239 --> 03:02:30,619
direction but that's different from

03:02:29,029 --> 03:02:30,950
mentoring them in the sense of let me

03:02:30,619 --> 03:02:32,450
sit

03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:34,450
with you and see what your problem is

03:02:32,450 --> 03:02:38,270
and help you work towards a solution

03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:39,500
it's more of a here's are the things

03:02:38,270 --> 03:02:41,750
that need to get done or here's the

03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:43,880
things you should focus on one and you

03:02:41,750 --> 03:02:45,170
should talk to so-and-so because they're

03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:46,939
the experts and they're gonna be able to

03:02:45,170 --> 03:02:49,280
give you direction there and sort of

03:02:46,939 --> 03:02:52,460
balancing how much I go into with each

03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:55,340
person there's certainly a subset so I

03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:57,020
am officially the director the level

03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:59,210
underneath me we call lead software

03:02:57,020 --> 03:03:01,760
engineers those people I tend to spend

03:02:59,210 --> 03:03:03,260
more time with because they're the ones

03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:05,930
who are interfacing with the rest of the

03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:13,400
development team on a day to day regular

03:03:05,930 --> 03:03:16,280
basis on projects other questions you

03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:18,140
mentioned about different tools that you

03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:20,330
were using or different tools my

03:03:18,140 --> 03:03:22,070
question is with client or service

03:03:20,330 --> 03:03:24,229
business that we are in a lot of clients

03:03:22,070 --> 03:03:28,010
kind of push the tools they'd prefer to

03:03:24,229 --> 03:03:29,870
use or works good for them and there are

03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:32,090
just so many different tools and

03:03:29,870 --> 03:03:34,400
different Google sheets and sometimes I

03:03:32,090 --> 03:03:36,140
feel that we are not being efficient and

03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:38,510
how secure is if you found some tools

03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:40,520
which are more efficient or something

03:03:38,510 --> 03:03:42,670
that is worked better for you in the

03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:45,290
agency business that you're in

03:03:42,670 --> 03:03:49,189
yeah definitely so from a tooling

03:03:45,290 --> 03:03:52,400
perspective we're fairly heavy users in

03:03:49,189 --> 03:03:54,710
the agency world of Atlassian confluence

03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:56,510
Plus JIRA on top of that we used your

03:03:54,710 --> 03:03:58,970
service desk so that clients can just

03:03:56,510 --> 03:04:01,640
send us requests via email for a lot of

03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:05,540
tools and then internally for

03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:09,470
communication we use slack we do have

03:04:05,540 --> 03:04:14,000
clients who like us to use their tools

03:04:09,470 --> 03:04:18,160
instead I have a client right now who is

03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:18,160
a big Microsoft team's fan

03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:23,970
so if I were to exit out of my

03:04:22,439 --> 03:04:25,770
presentation here and look at my laptop

03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:28,170
you would see that I have both slack and

03:04:25,770 --> 03:04:29,580
Microsoft teams open so that if this

03:04:28,170 --> 03:04:33,630
were a weekday we could chat back and

03:04:29,580 --> 03:04:36,360
forth but to sort of counteract that and

03:04:33,630 --> 03:04:38,370
combat that I try and have the

03:04:36,360 --> 03:04:40,680
conversations with the sales team and

03:04:38,370 --> 03:04:45,300
with our potential clients if possible

03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:48,270
about the value of letting us operate in

03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:52,020
the way that we we do and with the tools

03:04:48,270 --> 03:04:54,240
that we know if you want us to use the

03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:58,830
STS or Azure DevOps for as a code

03:04:54,240 --> 03:05:00,390
repository we could it's just not the

03:04:58,830 --> 03:05:01,860
workflow that we're normally accustomed

03:05:00,390 --> 03:05:03,630
to doing and so therefore things could

03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:05,760
make take more time as we use those

03:05:03,630 --> 03:05:08,010
additional tools and sort of having

03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:11,430
those conversations upfront and making

03:05:08,010 --> 03:05:14,070
sure they're aware of the trade-offs has

03:05:11,430 --> 03:05:15,810
sometimes caused them to say you guys

03:05:14,070 --> 03:05:19,290
can just use your stuff will happen well

03:05:15,810 --> 03:05:21,210
will agree to use yours because you are

03:05:19,290 --> 03:05:28,110
a very small piece and we want to get

03:05:21,210 --> 03:05:31,229
this out the door hi sir right over here

03:05:28,110 --> 03:05:33,000
hey I've been a manager for about a year

03:05:31,229 --> 03:05:34,860
and kind of we went through a chaotic

03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:37,260
situation where we went from outsourcing

03:05:34,860 --> 03:05:40,620
everything to having in-house developers

03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:42,120
and in the process of that we made just

03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:45,720
some basic mistakes have been happening

03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:49,439
and I'm just wondering like I want to

03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:50,640
apologize for those as as the leader I

03:05:49,439 --> 03:05:54,680
should have caught them in review and so

03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:57,090
forth but my team wants to also

03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:58,740
personally apologize and feel

03:05:57,090 --> 03:06:00,030
responsible for them that I don't want

03:05:58,740 --> 03:06:01,260
them to do that because I don't think

03:06:00,030 --> 03:06:02,820
it's her fault but I also don't want to

03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:04,160
take away their agency there any

03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:07,470
thoughts on that

03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:11,850
so I always tell the people that I work

03:06:07,470 --> 03:06:13,590
with that all of the victories that

03:06:11,850 --> 03:06:16,920
happen are because the team did a good

03:06:13,590 --> 03:06:20,780
job all the failures our problems are

03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:24,510
because I screwed up and I'm happy to

03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:26,280
get on the phone with clients or have

03:06:24,510 --> 03:06:29,400
those conversations and be the one who

03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:32,470
takes the the brunt of that internally

03:06:29,400 --> 03:06:33,819
we will reconcile amongst ourselves we

03:06:32,470 --> 03:06:38,290
we'll have that conversation we will

03:06:33,819 --> 03:06:39,640
work as a group of of co-workers to have

03:06:38,290 --> 03:06:41,020
accountability and discuss how we're

03:06:39,640 --> 03:06:44,170
gonna prevent it in the future but

03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:46,270
outwardly facing I try very hard to make

03:06:44,170 --> 03:06:50,430
sure everybody is aware and be the the

03:06:46,270 --> 03:06:50,430
face of it if there's a problem

03:06:51,870 --> 03:06:56,979
hi Brian

03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:58,720
hi Steve so those of us who work in an

03:06:56,979 --> 03:07:01,029
agency know that you know things get

03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:05,830
pretty crazy you can't get a hectic what

03:07:01,029 --> 03:07:07,450
strategies do you use to you know just

03:07:05,830 --> 03:07:10,600
not burn out and maintain a nice

03:07:07,450 --> 03:07:13,600
work-life balance it's a good question

03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:17,620
life is always a bit hectic and keeping

03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:21,279
that balance is is tricky one of the big

03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:24,790
things that I try and do is carve out

03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:26,290
time every day to go for a walk I'm

03:07:24,790 --> 03:07:29,590
fortunate enough to work in an area

03:07:26,290 --> 03:07:31,149
where we have a couple blocks in a park

03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:33,790
down the street where I can go to and if

03:07:31,149 --> 03:07:35,830
I have 20 minutes or 30 minutes on my

03:07:33,790 --> 03:07:37,630
calendar I figured out the exact path I

03:07:35,830 --> 03:07:39,489
can take to go down walk around the park

03:07:37,630 --> 03:07:42,010
in a big circle walk past the dog park

03:07:39,489 --> 03:07:43,899
and then walk back into the office 28

03:07:42,010 --> 03:07:46,930
minutes later which gives me two minutes

03:07:43,899 --> 03:07:49,630
to go and that's my opportunity to to

03:07:46,930 --> 03:07:52,600
clear my head and come back around to

03:07:49,630 --> 03:07:54,640
things the other side of it is as a

03:07:52,600 --> 03:07:57,880
manager I've gotten very good at

03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:59,680
compartmentalizing and so if I'm at home

03:07:57,880 --> 03:08:02,020
on the weekend or at home at nights

03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:04,750
being able to take and shut those work

03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:08,770
thoughts out and focus on what it is

03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:10,300
that that I'm doing for any managers out

03:08:08,770 --> 03:08:12,069
there that are struggling to

03:08:10,300 --> 03:08:14,439
compartmentalize I would recommend

03:08:12,069 --> 03:08:15,729
buying a house because that takes a lot

03:08:14,439 --> 03:08:18,550
of time and then lets you

03:08:15,729 --> 03:08:20,890
compartmentalize so that was part of my

03:08:18,550 --> 03:08:23,200
solution was I made a large investment

03:08:20,890 --> 03:08:25,330
in a house where I could have to focus

03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:27,069
time but you know compartmentalizing and

03:08:25,330 --> 03:08:30,939
keeping things separated and being able

03:08:27,069 --> 03:08:32,920
to put work away as much as you can when

03:08:30,939 --> 03:08:34,149
you're in the tech world and that's not

03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:35,529
to say that I won't deal with something

03:08:34,149 --> 03:08:37,899
at night if there's an emergency or

03:08:35,529 --> 03:08:40,090
somebody gets ahold of me but it's not

03:08:37,899 --> 03:08:43,410
my focus of living at day to day I focus

03:08:40,090 --> 03:08:43,410
on something else outside of that

03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:51,819
the question way in the back but you've

03:08:47,289 --> 03:08:54,639
got the mic over there yeah so I was

03:08:51,819 --> 03:08:57,339
curious how you adapted to dealing with

03:08:54,639 --> 03:08:58,989
more of the people side you talked about

03:08:57,339 --> 03:09:00,129
it like not programming people and

03:08:58,989 --> 03:09:02,889
things but what do you do if there's

03:09:00,129 --> 03:09:04,329
conflicts within the team and you know

03:09:02,889 --> 03:09:06,039
getting involved or if people have

03:09:04,329 --> 03:09:08,229
career aspirations to leave the team and

03:09:06,039 --> 03:09:09,759
it's growing and because you nut didn't

03:09:08,229 --> 03:09:11,949
always have this great group of

03:09:09,759 --> 03:09:14,679
developers and things so how do you deal

03:09:11,949 --> 03:09:19,599
with that sort of stuff sure definitely

03:09:14,679 --> 03:09:22,469
so as a manager about a year and a half

03:09:19,599 --> 03:09:24,609
ago or so I took the HR prescribed

03:09:22,469 --> 03:09:25,329
performance review system and I threw it

03:09:24,609 --> 03:09:28,149
out the window

03:09:25,329 --> 03:09:29,679
and I made my own where I talked with

03:09:28,149 --> 03:09:31,929
each of the people on the team and I had

03:09:29,679 --> 03:09:35,049
them do some prep work around what is it

03:09:31,929 --> 03:09:37,509
they wanted to do and then once I heard

03:09:35,049 --> 03:09:39,819
what they were interested in doing we

03:09:37,509 --> 03:09:41,979
had a conversation around how that would

03:09:39,819 --> 03:09:44,079
fit in with what we're doing currently

03:09:41,979 --> 03:09:47,589
as a company what the roadmap for the

03:09:44,079 --> 03:09:49,810
company looked like or if it didn't fit

03:09:47,589 --> 03:09:52,529
with the company at all and having those

03:09:49,810 --> 03:09:58,020
conversations with people allowed us to

03:09:52,529 --> 03:10:01,270
almost build tighter bonds as a manager

03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:03,909
employee because they started to realize

03:10:01,270 --> 03:10:06,689
that I was invested in them as a person

03:10:03,909 --> 03:10:09,039
versus invested in the business

03:10:06,689 --> 03:10:10,719
ultimately as a manager yes I'm

03:10:09,039 --> 03:10:12,520
accountable to the business and there

03:10:10,719 --> 03:10:15,909
are things that I need to do for the

03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:18,819
business and I need my team to do but as

03:10:15,909 --> 03:10:21,869
having that closer relationship with

03:10:18,819 --> 03:10:24,219
people it's allowed for better

03:10:21,869 --> 03:10:26,139
resolution to conflicts when they come

03:10:24,219 --> 03:10:28,149
up because they realize that I care

03:10:26,139 --> 03:10:29,499
about each of them and even though I am

03:10:28,149 --> 03:10:31,810
signing against them and I'm signing

03:10:29,499 --> 03:10:33,629
with somebody else there's a reason and

03:10:31,810 --> 03:10:36,249
rationale for it

03:10:33,629 --> 03:10:39,759
all of that said I think I was a bit

03:10:36,249 --> 03:10:41,379
more tricky when I got moved into a

03:10:39,759 --> 03:10:43,029
management position because I've got put

03:10:41,379 --> 03:10:45,759
in position managing a team I had been

03:10:43,029 --> 03:10:47,289
working with many of whom I would

03:10:45,759 --> 03:10:48,699
consider friends because we would play

03:10:47,289 --> 03:10:53,219
video games at night and that led to

03:10:48,699 --> 03:10:55,600
some very fun conversations around

03:10:53,219 --> 03:10:58,420
you're my friend

03:10:55,600 --> 03:11:01,900
we're friendly that was a stupid idea

03:10:58,420 --> 03:11:03,660
like you can't do that and being able to

03:11:01,900 --> 03:11:06,340
separate that and getting them to

03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:08,800
acknowledge that I'm telling you like

03:11:06,340 --> 03:11:11,620
this is me telling you as your boss you

03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:12,730
can't do this we're gonna go play video

03:11:11,620 --> 03:11:18,760
games tonight when we get out of here

03:11:12,730 --> 03:11:21,070
after happy hour you spoke a little bit

03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:22,750
about how you prevent burnout personally

03:11:21,070 --> 03:11:26,170
as a manager how do you prevent it in

03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:30,550
your staff preventing burnout in staff

03:11:26,170 --> 03:11:32,890
is definitely a a challenge I haven't

03:11:30,550 --> 03:11:34,450
fully solved it I get better at it the

03:11:32,890 --> 03:11:36,280
more people work with me because I get

03:11:34,450 --> 03:11:40,510
to know them better and I get to know

03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:44,370
their personality and how they react to

03:11:40,510 --> 03:11:48,521
things one of the things that I always

03:11:44,370 --> 03:11:52,060
say to people is that if you need time

03:11:48,521 --> 03:11:55,180
off let's have that conversation if you

03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:58,030
need to get away and being able to give

03:11:55,180 --> 03:11:59,800
people that variation and get them help

03:11:58,030 --> 03:12:01,510
on a project bring somebody else into a

03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:05,910
project or being able to swap people

03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:08,230
around on projects has served me their

03:12:05,910 --> 03:12:11,440
clients don't always like it when I swap

03:12:08,230 --> 03:12:12,670
developers on their projects but then

03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:14,710
when I have the conversation with the

03:12:12,670 --> 03:12:16,180
clients of well so-and-so is really

03:12:14,710 --> 03:12:18,460
burnt out we have to bring somebody else

03:12:16,180 --> 03:12:20,350
in they're like well I just need the

03:12:18,460 --> 03:12:22,390
project finished only what happens if

03:12:20,350 --> 03:12:22,900
this developer leaves what's the

03:12:22,390 --> 03:12:25,360
alternative

03:12:22,900 --> 03:12:26,860
and even when I work talk with my boss

03:12:25,360 --> 03:12:28,060
or the project managers about giving

03:12:26,860 --> 03:12:30,870
somebody off because they're burying

03:12:28,060 --> 03:12:34,900
being burnt out or they are burnt out

03:12:30,870 --> 03:12:38,710
the conversation always boils down to if

03:12:34,900 --> 03:12:40,960
we push them now and they are totally

03:12:38,710 --> 03:12:44,050
burnt out then they're gone for good

03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:45,910
and I'd rather keep them around so I'd

03:12:44,050 --> 03:12:48,280
rather give them the time now and deal

03:12:45,910 --> 03:12:51,271
with the short-term problem versus

03:12:48,280 --> 03:12:51,271
having a long-term problem

03:12:53,010 --> 03:12:57,600
so along the lines of being friends with

03:12:56,010 --> 03:12:58,920
the people that you're leading do you

03:12:57,600 --> 03:13:00,119
have like specific boundaries that you

03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:01,680
have in place to make sure you're being

03:13:00,119 --> 03:13:04,800
an effective leader and not just you

03:13:01,680 --> 03:13:07,619
know a pal yes

03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:12,180
so I refuse to talk about friends stuff

03:13:07,619 --> 03:13:14,220
in the work slack we have separate like

03:13:12,180 --> 03:13:17,640
friends slacks set up and I'm happy to

03:13:14,220 --> 03:13:20,069
have those conversations there but the I

03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:22,170
try and keep the the friendly stuff to a

03:13:20,069 --> 03:13:25,739
minimum in all of the different work

03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:27,960
channels in the most will I'll try and

03:13:25,739 --> 03:13:29,999
talk about is coordinating a time for

03:13:27,960 --> 03:13:32,310
something if we're having lunch together

03:13:29,999 --> 03:13:34,619
in the break room together but otherwise

03:13:32,310 --> 03:13:42,239
I try and keep those conversations

03:13:34,619 --> 03:13:46,170
completely separate all right I think

03:13:42,239 --> 03:13:48,230
that's everyone so lunch is downstairs

03:13:46,170 --> 03:13:52,810
thank you so much for coming
