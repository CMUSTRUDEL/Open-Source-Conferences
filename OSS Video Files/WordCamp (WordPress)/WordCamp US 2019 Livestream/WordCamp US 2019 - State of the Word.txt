oh good afternoon everybody

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,720
st. Louis how about that City Museum

00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,930
kind of wild do we still have the same

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,070
number of people here that's before yeah

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,310
that's always something to have to worry

00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:09,040
about Thank You Jen for welcomed us all

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:11,890
to work camp us the st. Louis he was

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,120
that an amazing job hosted but before we

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:17,350
actually get started with the state of

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,690
the word I have a surprise for you so

00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,850
there's been a documentary made about

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,940
WordPress and I think it really captures

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:28,030
the spirit of who we are and what we do

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:32,020
so before we get started I'd like to

00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:34,800
present the world premiere of open the

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,800
community code

00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,599
[Applause]

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,130
so Matt there's a ten billion dollar

00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57,109
ecosystem surrounding WordPress how do

00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,790
you reconcile all the volunteers giving

00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,920
so much of their time the community

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,930
without pay and the business of

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:11,960
WordPress that makes so much money I

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:13,910
think that the way we start that then I

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,619
open my browser to a choice of search

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,930
engines that look up menus almost

00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,180
anything I can think of whether it's my

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,740
project on Egypt or Andrew playing games

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,720
it sounds complicated

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,510
but really it all happens behind the

00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,460
scenes so it's easy for you and you're

00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,310
right you can find anything from

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,490
planning a vacation to MTV a real-time

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,589
live audio Pinet is fabulous now maybe

00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:38,690
you've read or heard about the internet

00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:39,230
but you're still not exactly sure what

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,150
it is

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,920
well if that's the case don't worry and

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,320
no time at all you'll be able to impress

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:53,590
everyone with your amazing techno-savvy

00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:53,590
[Music]

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,440
what about if I want to do my own

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:07,849
homepage now that's a big project you

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:12,220
better get someone to help you it's a

00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:15,020
piece of software that allows people to

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,800
produce and publish websites on the

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,520
Internet

00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,460
and do so at a very affordable price and

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,740
it its value is to be able to make

00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:28,040
publishing and internet publishing open

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,660
to everyone with WordPress it is open

00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,130
source so from a legal point of view

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,690
from a copyright point of view every

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,820
from a software freedom point of view

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,440
you can change every line of code you

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,440
can redistribute it you can fork it you

00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,240
can modify it you can delete it you can

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,790
do really whatever you like and

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,750
regardless of what the developers or the

00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,160
creator's want you to even you know you

00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,869
know a lot of people who haven't seen it

00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,210
probably don't understand it they kind

00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,700
of feel that if you release your wares

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,270
to the public then they're you're giving

00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,890
it away I mean how are you gonna monitor

00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:02,850
how you gonna make any money doing it

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:05,400
open source is a methodology for

00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:08,760
software development that literally

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,790
depends on a critical mass of humans and

00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,400
the more people we have contributing to

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:18,650
WordPress the open source software the

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,650
better the software gets for more people

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,860
WordPress is made by hundreds of

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,490
thousands of volunteers around the word

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:41,850
and most people think WordPress is made

00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:44,820
of code and it's true obviously it's a

00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:47,580
software so it's made of code but it's

00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:52,590
made of so much more your WordPress is

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:54,660
is a set of code it is a website is a

00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,210
service it is all these other things but

00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,800
it's also an idea idea that brings

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,330
people together and that ways something

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,190
we can believe in something it gives

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,140
hope and something that we can influence

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,580
and I think especially in today's day

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,040
and age when there's so much going on in

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,930
the world something that we can believe

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,100
in and it can make the world leave the

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,670
world a little bit better than how we

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,310
found it

00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:17,280
make a dent in the universe try to

00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,140
create the web that we want our loved

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,710
ones are our future progeny to grow up

00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,770
in it's sign to be a part of this

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,030
community is not made up of a group of

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,490
paid individuals they are all volunteers

00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,590
and so a lot of people think why do you

00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:36,510
do this what what is it about this

00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:38,790
community I think a lot about why what

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,400
motivates someone to participate in our

00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:45,300
program as a volunteer whether its day

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,930
of staff organizing team speaker etc

00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,780
some people come to us because they are

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:55,170
so grateful to have this free software

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,840
of WordPress and want to give back to

00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:01,320
the effort that makes WordPress possible

00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,000
a lot of people come to us as they

00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,980
believe in the mission and they want to

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,220
further it a lot of people come to us

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,200
because they realize that working within

00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:18,640
our program is a great way to grow there

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:20,680
skills a word camp is a conference that

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,500
is completely centered around WordPress

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,480
so if you go to another conference so

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,730
you're gonna go to a conference that has

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,859
all different kinds of topics right but

00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:33,150
when you go to a word camp it's two full

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:36,380
days of everything related to WordPress

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,380
[Music]

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,269
[Music]

00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,300
everybody here's long hearing is that

00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:55,270
right everyone here is volunteering now

00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:58,060
I should say that our lead organizer her

00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:01,300
volunteer has been a forty plus maybe

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:03,730
even a sixty plus volunteer job for at

00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,750
least the past three weeks probably even

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:10,329
more and so our we are volunteering but

00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,670
at the end violence hearing almost turns

00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:15,220
into that full-time job and so because

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,140
of that the volunteers either work for

00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:20,020
themselves and have their own company

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:23,920
and so they take their valuable time and

00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:26,290
give it to this initiative or they have

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,990
very understanding and supportive

00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:31,150
employers who understand the value of

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,420
community and who understand the value

00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:37,960
of this event and by doing so they then

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,940
allow all of us to just give everything

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,300
we have in these final stretch to this

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,300
event

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,789
[Music]

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,520
I've gone to a lot of conferences and

00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,650
those are called conferences and those

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,120
are called industry events this is

00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,200
called a community there's a difference

00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,840
based on that you go to an industry

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,360
event to go to a trade show it's about

00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,310
business you go to a WordCamp conference

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,130
it's about the community about making

00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,800
relationships WordPress is the community

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:14,380
it's the passion that people have for

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,890
what they do I think it's the idea that

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,020
you can create as you will and you can

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,300
work with people at things like work

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,070
camps and meetups and through the

00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,140
contributor teams and I think it just

00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:29,320
makes people feel at home and welcome

00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,390
and I think it's just something that

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,760
everyone is looking for someone a place

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,660
to belong every person in the community

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,250
has this commonality of being open and

00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:43,450
wanting to help others without fear of

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,170
hiding what they're working on or

00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:49,060
without fear of competition as you'll

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,120
see in this community or maybe as you

00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:53,950
have seen there are people that work for

00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,610
various web hosts that are all very good

00:42:53,950 --> 00:43:01,030
friends there's no sense of of you know

00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:03,460
we're better than you or we we don't

00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,380
want you to succeed everybody kind of

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,690
helps each other I mean we hear that in

00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,010
natural disaster so this community was

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,200
so great everybody stepped up and helped

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:14,740
you to help each other and I think

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,520
that's kind of human nature except when

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:20,620
you get into the world of business or I

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,420
want to sell this and make money or I

00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,600
need to do this to put food on the table

00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,230
in spite of all that when you come to a

00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,610
word camp it's so inspiring to see the

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,800
openness and the willingness of

00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,660
everybody to help each other I just got

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
there I was like this is unbelievable

00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,500
all these people are here to make a

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,170
piece of software that is used by other

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,990
millions of people this is a community

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:48,400
that really thrives on openness

00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:51,810
collaboration and including more people

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,810
than they necessarily need

00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,330
so Matt there's a ten billion dollar

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:02,280
ecosystem surrounding WordPress how do

00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,960
you reconcile all the volunteers giving

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,120
so much of their time the community

00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,780
without pay and the business of

00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:17,520
WordPress that makes so much money I

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:19,170
think that the way I may restart that so

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,060
WordPress is built on the GPL which

00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,440
provides the four freedoms one of the

00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,800
freedoms says that you can charge for

00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,080
things

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,110
so although we distribute all the

00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,760
WordPress stuff for free if you want to

00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,850
take it repackage it and charge for

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,670
that's totally fine so when you look at

00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:39,420
the ten billion dollars a year flowing

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,920
through the WordPress community it's

00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,810
built on things but it's also people

00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,280
building ecommerce tops and selling

00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,870
quilts all right silent photographs for

00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,550
selling anything else so it's moving

00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,410
it's enabled by WordPress and we have

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,260
this thing we push called fire for the

00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,930
future which is the idea that if

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,170
whatever you're getting out of WordPress

00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:00,300
if you can put 5% back into essentially

00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,970
things that benefit the community not

00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,230
just you it avoids a tragedy of the

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:09,720
Commons this sort of thing that is

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:12,030
common and open-source and in lots of

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,310
things that everyone kind of over Minds

00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,260
the shared resource and then it dries up

00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,640
it doesn't get they invest more their

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,300
caretaking it needs to be truly

00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,990
sustainable

00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,240
I think 5% is actually a good rule of

00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:28,020
thumb and that can be given back in

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,290
terms of time money donations it's just

00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,380
basically saying you know 5% of the time

00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,330
or 5% of my resources I'm going to put

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,830
back towards things that benefit the

00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,450
world

00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:45,400
Matt I think if the whole world that

00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,660
that it'd be a much better place why do

00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,490
you want to keep doing it isn't that

00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,740
time to exit you know let someone else

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,350
step in and do all of the work can't you

00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,780
know aren't you ready to let go no I'm

00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,880
not because if I wasn't doing this I

00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,580
would be missing it because I really

00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,770
enjoy it I have fun there's a great

00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,900
sense of accomplishment whenever you

00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:08,200
work with a group of people and when you

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,450
put together an amazing-looking and it

00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,400
has nothing to do with any kind of

00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,280
recognition any kind of business

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,720
decision it really is about this is

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,080
truly what I enjoy doing

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,540
it's a hobby it's a community over

00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,760
competition right it's like how can we

00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,170
build this thing that everyone everyone

00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,600
has a piece of the pie everyone has a

00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,490
way to impact the world with their

00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,140
thoughts and their beliefs and and I

00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,580
think that that's why I feel

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,920
passionately about it I like the idea

00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:39,480
that everyone is welcome and everyone

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,480
can create and everyone can change

00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:46,770
WordPress is a tool to candidates at

00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,690
blank canvas people can paint on it

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,630
something beautiful or they can take

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,580
paint something very hateful and ugly I

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:57,300
do believe that as humanity becomes more

00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:00,860
connected as we interact with each other

00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,090
more that that does start to break down

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,660
probably the biggest myth of modernity

00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:09,780
which is that we're all separate we're

00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,660
not and the more that people learn that

00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,390
and connect their fellow humans and

00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,360
other things in nature we realize that

00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,160
we're all part of the same system all

00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,290
part of the same thing the actions of

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,820
one impacts everything else in the

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:28,470
system whether that's the planet

00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:30,020
climate nature animals space hey who

00:47:28,470 --> 00:48:33,979
knows where it goes

00:47:30,020 --> 00:48:33,979
[Music]

00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,810
the Internet is a work in progress we

00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,420
can't tell you everything about it

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,640
because it's changing everyday that's

00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,740
right in fact the best advice we can

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:54,580
give you is get on it and start

00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:56,800
exploring let's go I have seen some

00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:00,010
familiar names there I was produced by

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,010
Mark maunder and Kathy's aunts you might

00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,760
know from some of the wordfence work but

00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,280
I thought this was a beautiful

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,510
contribution to the WordPress world and

00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,570
they're actually gonna be some mitigates

00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:12,670
of festivals coming up so hopefully this

00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,410
can make into the South by or one of the

00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,270
other great festivals if you have any

00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,340
pull with any of those please get in

00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:21,640
touch with mark or someone so we can get

00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,700
it in but a good illustration as well of

00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,620
the different types of contributions so

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,890
when I saw a preview of it as my first

00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:31,840
time seeing the final find the final cut

00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,910
Wow can we agree from mere that at state

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,720
of the war that mechanical so thank you

00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,720
all for joining that

00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,159
[Applause]

00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,800
so it officially jump in out of a st.

00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:50,170
Louis I'm told that this place is also

00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,320
called the loo that's something you'll

00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:58,420
say the people from the UK look at you

00:49:53,320 --> 00:50:00,040
funny this is actually not my first time

00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,920
in st. Louis I was back here for a

00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,160
happiness meetup in 2011 which was my

00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,660
first exposure to City Museum and of

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,550
course I'm I'm familiar with the st.

00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,070
lunatics and other cultural ambassadors

00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:15,040
you have out there in the world though

00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:18,570
it was not aware that st. Louis hosted

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,700
the World's Fair in 1904 and in fact

00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:23,080
many amazing technological innovations

00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,300
have come out of here including the

00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,580
wireless telephone x-ray machines

00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,010
electric streetcars and the first

00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:33,010
prototypes of personal automobiles which

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,300
back then are both gas and electric it

00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:38,260
took like a hundred years to come back

00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:40,210
to the electric so it seemed fitting to

00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:43,660
have the event here and also to look at

00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:46,900
where WordPress has been and where we're

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:51,490
going to go this event was brought to

00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:54,300
you by 47 organizers 122 volunteers and

00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:57,449
90 speakers yesterday and today

00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,449
[Applause]

00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:05,480
this event was also brought to you by

00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,940
the sponsors that make it so that the

00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:11,190
ticket is so inexpensive thank you the

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:15,110
Bluehost WooCommerce jetpack and Google

00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,110
[Applause]

00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:22,890
so as we head into the final months of

00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,990
2019 actually our earliest WordCamp us

00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:26,190
in a while it's good to take a good time

00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,580
to reflect on everything that we've

00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:31,080
worked together on collaborated our

00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,690
accomplishments and just everything

00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:36,180
going on with this year we've had two

00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:39,390
core releases so far this year first

00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:41,550
word for us 5.1 named for Betty Carter

00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,770
included the first iteration of this

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:48,780
site health screen chef you might be

00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:50,760
familiar with that's a few fans the idea

00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,590
behind this is that again WordPress is

00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,170
all about empowering users and we want

00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,970
to put the information and the tools in

00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,980
the hands of users as well to keep their

00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,930
site running in tip-top shape as we

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,880
power an ever-increasing percentage of

00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,170
the web and as our responsibilities

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,690
moves us to try to make sure that

00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,710
portion of the web is safe secure

00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,590
up-to-date and running the latest and

00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:12,390
greatest stuff so this allows because

00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:15,120
people information they can use

00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,940
themselves or get in touch with their

00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,710
support posting or things like that we

00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,730
had a lot of developer experience

00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:25,110
improvements in 5.1 putting the cron API

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,200
this is kind of the thing that runs in

00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:29,610
the background or dress that makes

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,380
actions happen at certain times so let's

00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,910
say you schedule a post you ever

00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,490
wondered how that actually gets posted

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,410
at the time when you schedule it we have

00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:40,220
kind of a weird cron thing built into

00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:42,780
WordPress we've enhanced it now so that

00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:47,190
advanced hosts are hosted have a lot of

00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,320
cron scheduled Taos can hook into that

00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,760
and make it more efficient we also for

00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,190
the multi-site fans in the room at at a

00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,230
site meta feature which gives developers

00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,210
more performant way mr. arbitrary data

00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,180
as opposed just dumping everything in

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,190
options like we used to

00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,710
5.2 name for Jaco Pastorius

00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,840
came out in May this one was pretty

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,850
exciting because what you see on the

00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,770
left there is the old widget screen on

00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:13,800
the right is the new widgets all

00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:16,170
available within Gutenberg which also

00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,250
means that you can edit them in line and

00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,200
see exactly what they're going to look

00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,050
like in the real time Gutenberg

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,700
interface we also I did a quick

00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,080
iteration based on feedback from yellow

00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,710
saying

00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,330
there were a lot of blocks good problem

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,310
that has so we made it for yourself--all

00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:34,400
for your clients you could hide or show

00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:37,670
certain blocks we have a block manager

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,860
and then finally you shouldn't see this

00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,660
anymore

00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,470
WS o d stands for the white screen of

00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,000
death

00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,500
I guess originally was called this

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,730
because you know as a play on the blue

00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,500
screen of death that Windows used to

00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,880
think less they have but basically what

00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,830
this means if you visit your site you

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,260
see this there was probably some sort of

00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,910
PHP error or something that is

00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,950
preventing your site from loading and

00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:04,730
unfortunately that makes it all so hard

00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,870
to fix your site if it's airing out so

00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,910
now when something like this happens

00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,500
particularly from an auto upgrade or a

00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,190
plug-in upgrade you'll get a special

00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,660
email with a link that lets you

00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:18,440
basically navigate to a URL which

00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:21,770
deactivates the plugin before it loads

00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:25,280
and allows you to then turn it off and

00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,050
get back into your sites so again this

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,940
is just an example of something coming

00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,160
up from users coming up from the Support

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,860
Forums that we've identified as common

00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,930
barriers and our user experience and did

00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,550
a lot of work to try to rectify

00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:43,070
WordPress 5.3 is coming out on a

00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:45,260
November 12 so just around the corner

00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,680
this is not a pre announcement of the

00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,830
jazzer

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,530
we always do that in the day so you'll

00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:54,380
see what jazz person is named for but

00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:58,250
it's a very very exciting release for a

00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:00,560
number of things we have over 150 block

00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,390
editor improvements so some of you might

00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,450
not know but the version of Guttenberg

00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:07,040
that's been shipping with WordPress 5.2

00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,540
is a few months out of date now and it's

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,290
been lots of update since then as I will

00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:13,490
talk about more later but it is I'm very

00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,260
very excited to get all the Guttenberg

00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,390
improvements in the hands of a wider

00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:23,660
audience it's also coming with a new

00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:27,830
default theme this is 20/20 it is a

00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:29,660
Gutenberg first beautiful CMS power

00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:32,300
theme with an original design

00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:36,110
contributed by Anders norm and then of

00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:38,900
course expanded by the 20/20 it is

00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:42,290
slick I have switched my own site ma ITT

00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,880
over to it and it really highlights some

00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,980
of the power of Gutenberg so I highly

00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,780
encourage checking it out if you would

00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,690
like to get involved in some of the

00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,430
final I guess basically done but if you

00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,260
want to see the code behind it and self

00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:57,980
what went into it you can check it out

00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,020
on github as well in the vein of

00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,550
improving things for administrators

00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,500
making WordPress easier to run for

00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,870
everyone we've put in a little screen

00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,100
that just kind of verifies your admin

00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:09,080
email which is separate from your user

00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,460
email so we would send out emails like

00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,440
when things were auto-updating and when

00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,880
things broke but we found that a lot of

00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,800
people had set up that email when they

00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,810
first started and never looked at it

00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,250
again so now about every six months

00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:22,610
you'll get like a little hey is this

00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,500
still your best email type screen again

00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,970
these things seem simple but it's a

00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,430
foundation on which we can build a lot

00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,500
else on because now we can start to make

00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:33,410
more things dependent on that and an

00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,210
email then also 5:3 is gonna have some

00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,470
more developer stuff it is it's good

00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,330
have so much Gutenberg girl talk about

00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:41,420
that later we did time and date

00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,950
component fixes that probably at least

00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,920
three people here in the audience know

00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:48,890
that huh let's raise your hand if you

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,590
know what those mean ah pretty savvy

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,840
audience that's at least forty and we of

00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:56,630
course updated to be compatible with the

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,810
latest PHP seven point four which is of

00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:02,810
course faster and better than ever

00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:05,880
it was also a year where we raised the

00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:09,250
minimum PHP versions of WordPress

00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:13,760
[Applause]

00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:16,490
we ended support for PHP 5.2 to 5.3 and

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,480
I have an interesting stat that for

00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:25,430
people running WordPress 5.2 which is

00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:28,670
our latest stable release 83% on PHP 5.0

00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:30,170
HB 7 or later so we are seeing people

00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,710
who are updating WordPress are also

00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:34,940
updating PHP which is very exciting

00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,349
however as we were digging to these

00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,420
stats we found something else which is

00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:42,050
about 10% of all of WordPress's we're

00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,609
tracking are on older versions of PHP so

00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:45,800
we think this might be contributing to

00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:47,660
some people being sort of stuck on some

00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,300
older versions of WordPress that it

00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:53,000
seems that they are running a higher

00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,710
percentage of the digital population of

00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,130
older versions of PHP which we track

00:57:54,710 --> 00:58:00,020
going all the way back to 5.0 and now so

00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:02,359
we still have a lot of work that 10% of

00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:05,089
the WordPress is on the world still too

00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:07,550
old to upgrade PHP ends up being a lot

00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:11,060
of them you could call that about 3% of

00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:12,109
the web so it sort of woke me up instead

00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,839
of that that we're going to need to

00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:17,330
really dive into these and work with the

00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:20,240
web host and people excuse me hosting

00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:22,700
them try to get in there to get these on

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,410
the latest and greatest wall this has

00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,540
all been going on there's been a ton of

00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:29,540
fun stuff happening on the mobile side

00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,010
of WordPress which is a crucial

00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,869
important for user adoption the part

00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:37,250
that sometimes we forget about in the

00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:38,869
day to day development so of the 38 core

00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,940
blocks that are in Guttenberg we have

00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:41,990
now ported 10 of them to mobile and we

00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:46,240
got good and Berger on mobile in the

00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:46,240
first place so the congrats of that team

00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:51,850
[Applause]

00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:55,330
so the block editor is now available on

00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:57,520
both iOS and Android devices including

00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:59,470
one additional block coming out and the

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,960
abilities coming out on Monday we are

00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:04,450
almost done with offline support which

00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,310
means you will be able to blog and use

00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:08,350
the WordPress app on a plane train or

00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,740
automobile when you are not connected or

00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:14,500
maybe even at a conference like this and

00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:16,780
we have a dark mode done on iOS and that

00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:21,190
will be coming to Android in a matter of

00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:23,860
weeks of course the people side of

00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:26,050
WordPress as we just heard from that the

00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:29,020
open film is one of the most exciting

00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:31,060
and the events and people side of

00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:34,540
WordPress has had an exciting year as

00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:37,210
well in 2019 there will be a hundred and

00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,160
forty one word camps those are the big

00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:42,280
ones all over the world thirty four of

00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:44,560
those in brand-new cities we also have

00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,110
this new thing 17 of which and one of

00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:53,680
which tomorrow called kids camps which

00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:56,619
is yeah events adjacent the word camp's

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,680
designed specifically for our younger

00:59:56,619 --> 01:00:01,450
contributors in fact I believe at this

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,530
camp we have one of our youngest here

01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:07,900
working of us one of our youngest

01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:12,460
speakers ever go from that yeah for at

01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:16,030
what age let's call it 14 or 15 so very

01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:17,560
very excited for a new generation it's a

01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:21,330
little scary to also think that they

01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:23,560
weren't born when WordPress started I

01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,850
know if that made it in your fold

01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:29,560
definitely made me feel a little

01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:31,869
advanced we've had over 5,000 meetups

01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,609
the WordPress meetups are the more like

01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:36,040
monthly events happening all over the

01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:39,220
world in almost every city and 16 do

01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:41,290
action charity hackathons this is where

01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,580
WordPress volunteers and community

01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:44,980
members come together and create

01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,340
websites for nonprofits and set them up

01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,200
to just have a beautiful web presence

01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,279
this was also a year when we started

01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,619
bringing

01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:56,829
and more of the people stories to the

01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:58,479
wordpress.org blog a new site so the

01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:59,890
icon on the left is he WordPress you

01:00:58,479 --> 01:01:01,719
haven't come across here oppressed

01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,880
before highly recommend checking it out

01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:05,589
and maybe you might even have a story

01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,839
you want to share there your press has a

01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:09,880
community site which highlights the

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:12,219
journeys of how people came to WordPress

01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,199
and the effect its had on their life and

01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:16,150
the fact they've had on WordPress as

01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:17,459
well we started highlighting one of

01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,049
these per month

01:01:17,459 --> 01:01:21,909
on the wordpress.org blog and it's been

01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:24,189
really really exciting to get to know

01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:26,140
more of the people behind WordPress and

01:01:24,189 --> 01:01:27,400
in fact many of them our stories that

01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:30,400
are new to me as well so it is a

01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:33,159
must-read for me every month there was a

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,229
bittersweet part or a sad part of 2019

01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:37,779
as well that we we did lose some

01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:39,999
community members notably VIPRE

01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:41,619
double-oh-seven bond also known as Alex

01:01:39,999 --> 01:01:44,289
Mills who was a longtime contributor

01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:45,849
friend and colleague I also recognize

01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:48,339
that many people why I've lost other

01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:49,959
folks in the community so I didn't want

01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:53,529
to take just a brief moment of silence

01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:55,979
to remember and thank those who are no

01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:55,979
longer with us

01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:09,060
Alex was an amazing contributor to

01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:13,260
WordPress a great friend a great

01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:15,780
colleague we are automatic is putting

01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,160
together a scholarship to parallel the

01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,020
Kim Parcells scholarship that's been

01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,700
going on for a few years now that brings

01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,610
some in the work camp us and this will

01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:27,360
be targeted at a plug-in developer who

01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:28,830
hasn't had the chance to visit work camp

01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,320
us yet and so they'll be a full

01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:33,000
scholarship full ride for them and the

01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,860
beautiful part of this is actually

01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,140
Alex's story mer is that quite a bit

01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,650
his mom was telling me where it was a

01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,580
little bit more introverted but he found

01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,290
out it was going to be a work camp

01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:45,270
nearby to him even though he'd been a

01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,130
big contributor he didn't never been

01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:49,410
seeing the events and went and that was

01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,420
part of what allowed on the blossom into

01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:53,130
finding a new set of friends a new

01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,050
community a job an automatic kind of

01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:59,910
everything that changed for him in that

01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:03,510
kind of last decade it has been a very

01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:06,270
very eventful 11 months we've had lots

01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:10,830
of ups and downs that's what this

01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:12,240
graphic is illustrating and but we've

01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:15,000
had thousands people come together as

01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,880
well I do want to rewind a little bit

01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,270
and talk about where we were just about

01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:25,140
a year ago so close your eyes and

01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:26,610
imagine that WordPress 5.0 probably the

01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,770
biggest change we had ever made to

01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:30,510
WordPress in its 16 year history came

01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:33,660
out the day before were camped us

01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:36,120
started in Nashville we have people

01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,070
according to work from airplanes they're

01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,080
imperfect improv do groups of core

01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:42,180
developers testing and packaging the

01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,890
release in the hallways the polyglots

01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,240
and marketers were support teams were

01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,160
just scrambling to get everything ready

01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,440
and of course we had that snazzy release

01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,610
video that was a pretty controversial

01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:55,050
year that year you we came together and

01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:58,830
decided to make this big change because

01:03:55,050 --> 01:04:00,780
we wanted to first disrupt ourselves we

01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:02,340
want to empower more WordPress users to

01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,870
realize our mission of democratizing

01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,960
publishing and want to make the web a

01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:10,890
more open and welcoming place but you

01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,270
know Gutenberg got some feedback these

01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,670
are all real tweets or quotes from

01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,900
articles I don't want to pile onto the

01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,359
Gutenberg hate but come on

01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,999
this is nowhere near ready I think it's

01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:23,099
safe to say absolutely capitols hate the

01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:27,650
Gutenberg editor on WordPress now and a

01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:27,650
lowercase P says for salt in the ruins

01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:33,569
Gutenberg is just plain terrible and

01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:36,660
barely functional a design should make

01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:39,589
my life easier not harder and finally

01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:41,759
don't update the wordpress 5.0 mm-hmm

01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:44,279
you know there was lots and lots of

01:04:41,759 --> 01:04:47,400
feedback on that and I think we learned

01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:49,440
a lot both in the process but also in

01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,180
how we can communicate change better in

01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,450
the future although there are no changes

01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:56,160
on the horizon as big as Gutenberg was

01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:57,450
you know think of that as like you know

01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,069
in batteries swing with a couple bats

01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,269
before they go to the map we now have

01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:03,690
really good practice for any future

01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:06,619
future changes you want to make I think

01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:09,599
that we also have a great opportunity

01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:11,190
with changes in the future sort of build

01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,650
that trust in the conversations around

01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:16,079
testing using github for development

01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,490
things like accessibility so I

01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,489
understand why we had a lot of this

01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:24,989
feedback but we did get through it

01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:27,599
together so thank you we have had since

01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:29,759
that five point over these 20 releases

01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,039
of the gutenberg plugin so the pace of

01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:34,230
iteration of gutenberg has kept up and

01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,519
i'm also very very proud to say because

01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:39,150
there was some discussion around kind of

01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,859
contributions that the number of

01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:45,420
gutenberg contributors since 5.0 has

01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:49,529
grown from 200 over 480 over developed

01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,480
over a doubling year to year i'm also

01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:53,039
very very excited to say that even as

01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,960
wordpress becomes more advanced we

01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:59,220
incorporate new technologies you're all

01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,779
learning javascript deeply is that we're

01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,739
gonna have the most contributors we ever

01:06:00,779 --> 01:06:05,789
had to wordpress ever this year so in

01:06:03,739 --> 01:06:07,799
2018 we had about five hundred and

01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:10,549
ninety four contributors this year so

01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:14,390
far right eleven hundred and twenty two

01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:17,710
unique contributors thank you

01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,710
[Applause]

01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:25,150
so thank you for clapping allows me to

01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:29,020
take a drink you want to throw some more

01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:31,510
in there the current release version 5.3

01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,670
coming out November 12 it's set to have

01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:37,300
the most contributors of any release in

01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:38,830
history by over a hundred people I'm

01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,390
also happy to say that the adoption of

01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:44,020
Guttenberg is going fantastic

01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:46,000
they have 2.7 over 2.7 more sites using

01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,310
Gutenberg than that and this is actually

01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,050
probably under Counting because we're

01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:51,970
subtracting everyone using the classic

01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:53,230
editor from this but of course those of

01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:55,270
you who might be using the classic

01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:57,520
editor know but of a classic editor is a

01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:59,440
plugin we promoted very heavily with the

01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,420
upgrade to 5.0 that a lot of people to

01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,580
still use the old editor as well as

01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,680
using new editor but it actually classic

01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,300
editor doesn't turn off Gutenberg allows

01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,550
you to toggle between them so you can

01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,820
decide on a per post basis what you want

01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:15,070
to use so we believe some interesting

01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,630
number I don't have any of that thing

01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:18,400
but interesting number of the classic

01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:22,420
editor users are actually also using

01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:25,030
Gutenberg as well we just passed two

01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:32,320
days ago 50 million post made with

01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:35,800
Gutenberg and that number is going up

01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:39,760
fast we're seeing over 270,000 per day

01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:42,130
and again this is a subset of the poster

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,540
retracting this is only folks running

01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:47,290
the jetpack plugin that we get this step

01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:48,970
from so there is even a larger that is

01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,870
the the floor of whether that number

01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:54,850
actually is so to look at where

01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:56,200
Gutenberg is today and to talk about

01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,120
some of the development and work we've

01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,480
been putting into it first and foremost

01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,520
I want to talk about performance I am so

01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,110
proud of the team for this graph so what

01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,470
you see on the left there is the average

01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:10,450
seconds to load for version 5.0 then all

01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,610
the way on the right is release

01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:16,270
candidate to of version 5.3 so we've

01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:19,510
halved the time it takes a load Goodin

01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:21,160
burg on the post and edit screen we also

01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:23,020
one of the things that we noticed when

01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,650
we first launched is that the actual

01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,330
typing lag

01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:28,339
for all the complex things we were doing

01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:31,850
Gutenberg was fairly high so it has gone

01:08:28,339 --> 01:08:36,739
from 170 milliseconds in 5.0 now down to

01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:38,630
53 milliseconds again down by two-thirds

01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:41,290
in terms of the speed that's going in

01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:44,210
there we put in some fun user

01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:45,620
enhancements so for example when we

01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:47,089
first launched when you move locks

01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,180
around which is what you're seeing on

01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:52,730
the left you just pop around we've added

01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:55,100
motion so now you kind of can see what's

01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,380
going on it just feels a lot better and

01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,540
of course this also respects the motion

01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:02,359
sensitivity settings which you can set

01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,400
in your browser for accessibility we

01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:06,049
added a typewriter mode so this is

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,819
pretty fun because like a classic

01:09:06,049 --> 01:09:10,640
typewriter it keeps your vertical place

01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:12,470
as you type so Savoy ajar and jumps or

01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,330
cases of typing near the bottom of the

01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:15,830
screen just so much more pleasant editor

01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:19,160
experience and something that now I want

01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,839
from every single editor I use we had a

01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,589
block previous so what you're saying

01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:26,120
here is now when you because the blocks

01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:28,450
you know just when it was just that icon

01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,350
on the name you'd never know we

01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:32,029
recreated a little bit the mystery me

01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,230
problem we were trying to solve so if

01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:37,040
the block Creek needs to do is show you

01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:38,390
right next to it exactly or preview of

01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,549
what the block is going to look like and

01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,750
it allows for more explanation so if you

01:09:40,549 --> 01:09:44,569
are clicking on something and you're

01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:47,420
like what is masonry which is a fair

01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:50,150
question to ask it'll show you that

01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,950
that's actually what we call these cool

01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:55,550
tile galleries kind of Pinterest style

01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:58,010
galleries we created a quick navigation

01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:59,630
mode which helps with both usability and

01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,040
accessibility for you to be able to

01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:03,260
navigate through blocks with a keyboard

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,350
and you can press escape to go into that

01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:07,820
navigation mode what is coming for

01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,800
Gutenberg because I'm even more excited

01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:12,970
about the ketchup that we're doing in

01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:16,850
version 5.3 this is the simplest thing

01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:18,080
but wow we actually found we've been

01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:20,810
gathering some stats when people are

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,030
searching for for Gutenberg blocks and

01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:27,440
one of the very very top things was

01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:29,150
social icons these are like the NASCAR

01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:33,910
stickers of the width

01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:36,680
they're everywhere but you can now add

01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:38,120
icons any place you can put a Guttenberg

01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,910
block and we created a really nice

01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,460
interface for doing so a huge project

01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:45,440
that we've been working on is taking the

01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:47,510
navigation menu so this is what

01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,940
previously was an entire screen inside a

01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,100
WordPress with its own everything that's

01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,140
what you see on the left and making it

01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,610
an inline Guttenberg block that still

01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:58,130
supports all the same functionality and

01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:00,650
even add some new so what you're seeing

01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:02,420
there is a color picker which previously

01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:06,800
wasn't even something you could do with

01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:09,350
the old navigation editor by the way you

01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,840
might notice we renamed it two menus to

01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:14,060
navigation this is going to make all the

01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:18,740
restaurant users of WordPress understand

01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:22,130
it a lot faster real issue we've run

01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:24,200
into in testing we've created it at the

01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:26,360
ability to do gradients and Gutenberg

01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,070
and a gradient tool this was actually

01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,110
pretty fun because it's a fairly complex

01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:33,500
interaction but we were able to put it

01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:38,300
together in a exciting way so you can

01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:39,710
create blocks like it's 1999 again that

01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:42,410
of course pairs well with our multi

01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:43,970
button block another thing they seem

01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:45,410
basic but these are things that we were

01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:47,030
running into quite a bit that people

01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:49,430
were asking for

01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:52,130
we are very now far we're now a year

01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,420
into the idea in the reality that they

01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:55,280
were there's going to be a thousand blog

01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:57,350
blooming so people are creating blocks

01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,720
left and right and it's it's really

01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:02,360
exciting to see what's going on so one

01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,340
of the things that I'm most proud of the

01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:07,400
team of four doing as well so they have

01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:09,250
a block directory so what this is is

01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,230
that you're going to be able to install

01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:15,290
blocks in the block directory completely

01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:17,630
in line so what you just saw happening

01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:19,970
right there was what was happening in

01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:21,200
the background rather is someone typed

01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:24,380
in the block they were looking for

01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,910
didn't find anything they went it called

01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:28,610
out to the centralized WordPress out or

01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:30,050
block directory they clicked at it and

01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:32,150
what happened was essentially like a

01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:34,640
plugin got installed activated in the

01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,380
background and the block was available

01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,219
to insert completely instantly

01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:48,329
completely in line with no page

01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:51,059
or anything this is also really fun

01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:52,769
because as the block directory grows and

01:12:51,059 --> 01:12:55,199
incorporate hundreds and thousands of

01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:58,050
blocks you can use those building blocks

01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:59,760
just in line as what you're doing

01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:02,309
we are also going to expand this to

01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,599
include patterns patterns block patterns

01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:05,760
or what we're calling collections of

01:13:03,599 --> 01:13:09,269
blocks so if you could imagine like a

01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:12,599
testimonial pattern or you know slider

01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:15,389
type things basically collections of the

01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:17,880
basic building blocks that take the most

01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:19,499
common patterns that you see on websites

01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,539
all over the world and make them

01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:24,420
accessible to install with just a single

01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:26,190
click the idea here and what we're

01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,469
really trying to enable with these

01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:29,969
fundamental building blocks is that you

01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:32,610
could look at any website in the world

01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:37,110
and build that inside of WordPress with

01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:39,300
just a few clicks it is coming on the

01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:45,090
community side of things we've also seen

01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:46,849
some pretty cool examples this is the

01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:51,239
Morgan banker Mortgage Bankers

01:13:46,849 --> 01:13:52,619
Association a site built by RT camp and

01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:54,360
they created a block template for the

01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:56,550
newsletter functionality so it's

01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,309
actually happening right here they are

01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:02,909
building an email newsletter in line

01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:05,400
with Gutenberg they give a quick call

01:14:02,909 --> 01:14:08,550
out to Word Camp Phoenix and you folks

01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,960
from Phoenix hear nice which also got a

01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:12,690
little call out in the film

01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:15,960
I also made me realize how weird the

01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:17,340
word Phoenix is when you look at it it's

01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,340
like the word weird you're like how is

01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:22,800
that Oh or either this is a hundred

01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,840
percent blocks and in fact many of the

01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,429
work camps including working of us are

01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:31,889
now building their entire sites just

01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:34,679
using Gutenberg and blocks 9 publishing

01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:37,739
is using an interface and to room 2

01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:41,489
newsrooms for different mail outs are

01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:44,729
doing for Gutenberg they estimates they

01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:46,409
are saving 15 hours a week for editors

01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:47,489
across both newsrooms when they

01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:51,989
implemented this

01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:54,840
Gutenberg interface finally pragmatic

01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:57,150
created a plugin which takes a client

01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,989
created Word documents that WordPress

01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:02,760
Word and associated images imports the

01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:04,770
content directly in the Gutenberg editor

01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,840
and using a combination of core and

01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:10,110
custom blocks basically makes it ready

01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:13,320
to go into their publishing system which

01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:14,580
again super super cool a quick round of

01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,819
applause for these folks building

01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,819
[Applause]

01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:28,489
and also for deciphering the word

01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:32,510
document format it's impressive

01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:34,730
in and of itself last year remember it

01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:37,010
actually came up in the QA I was someone

01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:40,489
asked what percentage Gutenberg was done

01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:44,110
and I said we're about 10% done I'm very

01:15:40,489 --> 01:15:47,449
sad to say that we're now about 20% done

01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:49,310
so the important changes and part of why

01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:51,739
we we made the investment in Gutenberg

01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:53,330
well as this is the fundamental

01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:55,850
foundation that we're going to build the

01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:59,600
next decade of WordPress on there and I

01:15:55,850 --> 01:16:01,930
so will do about 10 percent per year but

01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,170
already as we get to 20 percent it is

01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,980
incredible humbling and awe-inspiring

01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:10,850
everything that people are able to

01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:13,040
create with what's in there already so

01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:16,880
give a quick reminder there are going to

01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:19,280
be four phases of Gutenberg we are I

01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,440
would say on the tail end of the easier

01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,719
and editing phase this is where we're

01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,150
tackling all the usability problems we

01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:28,910
had in tiny MCE and our former editors

01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:32,090
where people having trouble manipulating

01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:34,070
embeds short codes images basically

01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:35,750
getting the layouts and formatting that

01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:38,420
they wanted with the old editor we have

01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:41,180
increased that usability tremendously

01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:43,160
and the Gutenberg team still does at

01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,350
least one usability test per week and

01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:48,890
post them at least once a month so the

01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:51,440
make blogs showing kind of progress of

01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:53,150
those kind of real world you know not

01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,910
people here this room people new to

01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:58,969
WordPress how are they able to use this

01:16:55,910 --> 01:17:01,160
interface we are currently in the thick

01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:03,440
of the second phase phase 2 which is all

01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,330
around customization give you a little

01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,250
update there we have completed

01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:10,340
converting all the widgets to blocks

01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:11,540
block customization navigation menu

01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,199
which isn't a plugin but it's going to

01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,670
come in core the widget block screen and

01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:19,160
customize our widgets panel with block

01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:21,170
support we are finishing up a block

01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:24,410
pattern directory and implementing full

01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:25,820
site editing you like I slipped the

01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:28,400
biggest thing there just as a final

01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,710
bullet point

01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:33,739
but it is coming along and there is a

01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:36,860
light at the end of the tunnel as a

01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:39,020
quick reminder the final two phases the

01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,610
third one is going to be collaboration

01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,440
which is where we take everything that

01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:45,650
you're seeing Guttenberg and make it so

01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,210
you that you can real-time co-edit with

01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:49,040
anyone else who is editing the same

01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:51,230
things that you are and I also think a

01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,410
lot and invest some development into the

01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:58,120
workflow around changes and sharing

01:17:54,410 --> 01:18:01,160
changes previews etc and then finally

01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,290
last we're going to tackle the Babel

01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:06,200
Fish problem and have multilingual

01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:09,560
support core to WordPress and core to

01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:19,580
Gutenberg and Europe always get super

01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:23,110
excited about that we're still at the

01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:25,790
very very beginning of this journey

01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:26,239
we've been doing good Berg for about two

01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,760
years now

01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:32,150
there are 47 releases prior to 5.0

01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:34,460
coming out with that 20 since then it's

01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:37,010
the community all of you that really

01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,350
make WordPress great it was so

01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,270
interesting how quickly the individual

01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:44,170
interviews in that film all went back to

01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:46,910
that same we're at community community

01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:49,670
there's so many parts of how you can get

01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:51,590
involved with WordPress and I want to

01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:53,660
talk about some of the ways or some of

01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:55,730
my suggestions for if you're watching

01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,800
this other than thousand something

01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:59,420
people here in this room are the many on

01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,350
the live stream are the folks who are

01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:05,960
gonna watch this later ways that you can

01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:09,350
get involved and being a co-creator or

01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:11,900
WordPress first is helping be the change

01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:13,370
and you might have heard before every

01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:16,100
single talk we've given that tomorrow

01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:19,040
there's going to be a contributor day so

01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,330
if you are able to get to one of the big

01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,370
word camps there is typically a

01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:24,770
contributor day afterwards and what this

01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:27,230
is is kind of like the real-life version

01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:30,080
of what we have online so instead of

01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:31,790
going to a make dot wordpress.org p2 and

01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,640
seeing what's going on there will be a

01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:37,130
physical table for all the people who

01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,300
are passionate about localization all

01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:39,469
the people working on the editor

01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:42,260
all the people working on whatever that

01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:45,409
is and you can walk over that table and

01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:48,290
be part alongside the people who make

01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:49,309
WordPress I love this concept and it's

01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:51,739
one of the most powerful things in the

01:19:49,309 --> 01:19:54,290
world that with every bit of technology

01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:56,719
that you interact with every day someone

01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,250
made that and with WordPress which many

01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,570
of you interact with every day it's

01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,429
probably someone sitting here in this

01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:04,219
room and you could very easily become

01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:09,559
one of them so go by the contributor day

01:20:04,219 --> 01:20:11,540
to get involved another fun thing is the

01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:15,920
gutenberg plugin is still there so when

01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:17,449
people upgrade to 5.0 we turned off the

01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,949
gutenberg plugin for them automatically

01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:21,829
because we had I think over a million

01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:23,420
testers before but about two hundred

01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:24,710
seventy thousand two hundred and

01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,630
seventy-five thousand people have turned

01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:29,860
it back on this means that they are

01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:33,980
getting those weekly or fortnightly

01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:36,050
updates to the Gutenberg plugin before

01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,820
those things get shipped in the core so

01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:40,190
if you would like to see the latest and

01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,869
greatest of Gutenberg Kirby and there's

01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:43,460
a very active feedback channel there for

01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:45,469
reporting bugs but if you'd like to help

01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:48,020
define what's coming next and Kornberg

01:20:45,469 --> 01:20:51,020
install this plugin it's also neat

01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:52,159
because it kind of gets you the latest

01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:55,280
and greatest before the core release

01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:57,020
comes out we've also been doing a lot of

01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,579
experiments with beta plugins to allow

01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:00,770
us to test features before they go into

01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:03,170
core and one that's pretty small still

01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:06,650
only a little over 100 sites running it

01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:08,300
but I'd like people to check out and

01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,010
participate with is design experiments

01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,290
so this is where we're actually able to

01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:15,110
make user interface changes to WordPress

01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:17,329
in a plugin before we put it into core

01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:19,190
and can get feedback and also do user

01:21:17,329 --> 01:21:20,780
testing on this basically one of the

01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:22,670
best things we learn from Gutenberg is

01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:25,040
that we don't need to be beholden to the

01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,929
core release schedule which at our best

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,880
is three times per year to be able to

01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:32,809
rapidly iterate and get changes in the

01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,000
hands of users users are the oxygen for

01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:37,550
any software and without it you don't

01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,380
really know despite whatever planning

01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:40,760
what you might do you don't really know

01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,199
how people are going to use and interact

01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,449
with the software so it's really really

01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:46,869
important I want to highlight this fun

01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:49,190
tweet from someone who actually

01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:49,800
reinstalled a good neighbor plugin this

01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:52,079
is Hanna

01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,760
said install the gutenberg plugins today

01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,010
which upgrades the features a chip with

01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,349
core i wanted the cover block and i was

01:21:56,010 --> 01:22:00,929
curious to check it out OMG exclamation

01:21:58,349 --> 01:22:03,300
point exclamation point it's like a

01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:05,040
million times better if this stuff goes

01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:08,099
in the core we're all in for a treat

01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:13,230
well done to all the contributors so you

01:22:08,099 --> 01:22:14,940
can be like hannah i have there are

01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:16,710
three exclamation points in this tweet

01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,150
which is pretty impressive for 280

01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,469
characters that's a high percentage of

01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:24,989
exclamation points the rest of the

01:22:19,469 --> 01:22:28,829
characters in the tweet we need more

01:22:24,989 --> 01:22:32,909
blocks so one of the most exciting ways

01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:34,320
to expand the kind of window of what

01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:36,119
people are able to do with WordPress

01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,130
today is creating more of those blocks

01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,349
so if you're building sites for clients

01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,489
or friends or yourself and you find

01:22:40,349 --> 01:22:43,260
yourself needing something that

01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,699
Gutenberg doesn't yet support and you

01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,230
have the technical wherewithal you've

01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:48,260
learned JavaScript deeply and are able

01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:50,250
to build it share that please

01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,510
particularly if it's JavaScript only you

01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:55,409
can go in our play in our block

01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:57,900
directory as a blocks increase it's

01:22:55,409 --> 01:23:01,380
almost like the people using the canvas

01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:03,329
of WordPress are getting new colors and

01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,429
textures and paintbrushes they can use

01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:09,659
and the things that get created are so

01:23:05,429 --> 01:23:11,280
inspiring also if you have that

01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:13,650
technical wherewithal or know a lot

01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:16,530
about WordPress think about helping

01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:18,540
teach to change so every single person

01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:20,340
who contributes to WordPress pretty much

01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:22,020
at some point had someone else help them

01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,760
get involved that's part of our we have

01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:25,619
the contributor days it's part of why we

01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,659
make all of our meetings open on slack

01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:28,949
and put out all the notes on p2 and just

01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:30,540
try to household a whole the whole

01:23:28,949 --> 01:23:34,020
development of WordPress be as open as

01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:35,460
possible is that teaching aspect it's

01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,159
really one of the only places in the

01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,380
world as well you can sort of work

01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,630
alongside developers who create the

01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:45,360
software that runs a third of the web

01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:47,489
and so if you want to learn better PHP

01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,559
or better JavaScript I can think of no

01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:54,860
better kind of master class or a

01:23:49,559 --> 01:23:56,909
real-world studio with which to do that

01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:58,260
if you're interested in learning more

01:23:56,909 --> 01:24:01,860
hopefully you made it to the get

01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:04,500
involved booth which was here at

01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,880
at the events but if nots come to

01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,160
contributor day tomorrow so we'll be

01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,050
happy to walk you through things or

01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:14,490
check out make dot wordpress.org because

01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:16,200
we all make WordPress together sharing

01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:20,550
your knowledge can also come through

01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:24,020
events and meetups this is a map of all

01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:33,000
the meetups happening all over the world

01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:36,600
looks like even green lands not Iceland

01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,140
oh come on Reykjavik what's going on as

01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:42,570
you can see all over the world there is

01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,250
probably a WordPress meetup near you and

01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:47,670
if there's not like let's say you're an

01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:49,350
Iceland you could start one and these

01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:51,360
are really really fun ways to bring

01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:53,760
community together and also allow you to

01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,830
experience the best part of WordPress

01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,670
which is the people the software is

01:24:55,830 --> 01:25:03,630
pretty good but that people are amazing

01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:05,700
in 2020 we're also going to redo our

01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:08,010
regional events for camp us and we're

01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,780
camp Europe and we're going to add a new

01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:10,650
one which is working at Asia for the

01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:16,030
first time

01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:16,030
[Applause]

01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:20,700
these regional events are fantastic for

01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:22,650
bringing together contributors in

01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,720
particular so you get a lot of the local

01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:26,760
work camp organizers how the meetup

01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:29,220
folks come to these regional work camps

01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,620
and can really share and learn at a very

01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:35,370
very high level I believe work camp Asia

01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:39,720
will be in February and this first year

01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:42,510
will be in Bangkok Thailand so if you've

01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:46,340
ever wanted to visit there good excuse

01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:49,620
to and we're camp Europe it's gonna be

01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:54,150
Porto oh my good that's right

01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:56,670
I love Porto to Porto and Portugal also

01:25:54,150 --> 01:26:00,840
where Airport is from you ever enjoyed a

01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:04,020
good port so check that out and we're

camp us we'll be right back here and st.

01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,290
Louis

01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:16,350
I might need to come a week early just

01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:20,710
to go to like city museum every day I

01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:22,330
did not realize there was a roof which

01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:24,070
makes me wonder I was kind of wondering

01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:25,540
with my sister actually makes me wonder

01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:28,360
how many floors in between where I got

01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:31,780
to anyway where the roof was that I

01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:34,030
missed oh my goodness I was uh we've

01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,950
apparently had more social media posts

01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:37,720
and tweets and Tumblr posts and

01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:40,600
WordPress blog post everything this war

01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:44,280
camp that we've ever had and I've been

01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:46,540
following it as well the WC us tag and

01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:48,700
it's been really really fun to kind of

01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:55,000
live vicariously through parts of this

01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:58,450
event I was at but did not see why are

01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,730
we doing all this we're trying to help

01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:03,040
open the web there is a very natural

01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:05,200
pendulum that sweet swings both in

01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,290
societies and technology and in the web

01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,880
between open and closed and as it swings

01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:12,160
back towards open it doesn't happen for

01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:16,030
free doesn't happen automatically it

01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:18,760
happens to a lot of hard work from

01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:21,220
people like here in this room creating

01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:23,410
the type of web that we want to live in

01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:27,010
and we want the people going to kids

01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:30,520
camps and their children to live it we

01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:32,910
are putting together for WordPress a few

01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:37,090
to final things that I'm going to plug

01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:40,180
first is now on work press org slash

01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:42,670
news we are doing our annual survey

01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,650
which is a very exciting way to show for

01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:46,510
our corner of the web what is going on

01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:48,490
and the technologies and things that are

01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:51,130
happening we are also translating this

01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:52,660
into I believe six or more languages so

01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:55,330
we'll be able to for the first time or

01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:59,290
four better than we have in the past get

01:27:55,330 --> 01:28:01,780
feedback from the non English parts of

01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:03,160
WordPress as well and then finally a

01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:05,350
little surprise announcement for y'all

01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,300
is you saw a lot of talk for five for

01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:09,570
the future just to briefly reiterate

01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,240
fire for the future is this idea that

01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:14,830
WordPress is a big part of your life

01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:16,660
trying to think how you can take five

01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:18,930
percent of your time however that might

01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:22,120
be defined to be money resources

01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:22,900
colleagues whatever it could be put back

01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,660
in the comments

01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:28,420
so that you know the kind of core

01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:32,170
WordPress which is again built larger by

01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:33,910
like people here in this room can grow

01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:36,460
and get better and be something that

01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:38,890
sort of we can benefit from and future

01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:41,560
generations can benefit from too so here

01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:43,930
wordpress.org slash five you can type

01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,430
the number or spill it out we now have a

01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:47,170
directory it's actually I believe came

01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:48,820
up in a question maybe last year might

01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:50,200
have been more camp your ever here which

01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:52,450
is is there a way we can highlight the

01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,430
people who are contributing that fire

01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:56,920
for the future so what this allows is

01:28:54,430 --> 01:29:01,780
either for individuals or organizations

01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:03,490
to pledge and show everything they are

01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:05,230
sort of pledging and committing to

01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:08,440
WordPress and you can browse them and

01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:10,600
then of course if you are ever trying to

01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:12,250
hire an agency or web post or things in

01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,750
like something like that definitely take

01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:17,680
a look at the fire for the future page

01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:20,620
to see which organizations back to

01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:22,200
WordPress and try to vote with your

01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:24,640
wallet to support the folks who are

01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,920
really making sure that WordPress can

01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:36,310
continue for many years and decades to

01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:39,280
come alright that's all I got actually

01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:45,510
Lele Lele away with it there's there's

01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:49,450
one more thing well ready for this so um

01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:54,760
this entire presentation was actually in

01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:59,290
Gutenberg so this was all on a web page

01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:04,000
and in fact the speaker view which I'll

01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:06,700
bring over here is another web page and

01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,070
this was all edited let's see if I click

01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:13,900
this what will happen I'll edit it

01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:17,140
inside of WP admin through good work

01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:17,140
[Applause]

01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:31,790
also kind of amazing didn't break

01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:36,610
duration let me make this fullscreen

01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:39,800
again bring this window back I lost it

01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:41,660
present your speaker view I'll bring

01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,510
that back Shh

01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:48,260
full screen and this code is all on

01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:50,450
github we'll be releasing it and can we

01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:56,800
give a quick round of applause for stand

01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:56,800
up if you were working on this lol mark

01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:09,559
there was so much code happening till

01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:11,780
about like 25 minutes ago I am impressed

01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:15,229
and amazed that that came together so

01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:17,539
well so congratulations on that all

01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:21,499
right now really we can go to questions

01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:23,059
and answers so just a quick so our

01:31:21,499 --> 01:31:25,039
guidelines were here we'll have two mics

01:31:23,059 --> 01:31:26,599
up here in the front so you can kind of

01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,729
walk up and line up and we'll get to

01:31:26,599 --> 01:31:30,559
them a light will briefly shine on you

01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:33,679
when you're gonna ask your question and

01:31:30,559 --> 01:31:36,369
say your name where you're from and try

01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,369
to make it a question

01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:44,329
hello Matt Ryan Kenney from Miami as a

01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:46,429
volunteer speaker organizer and

01:31:44,329 --> 01:31:47,929
contributor that passionately supports

01:31:46,429 --> 01:31:51,110
WordPress and our shared mission to

01:31:47,929 --> 01:31:53,329
create a more open and accessible web

01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:55,579
I'm concerned because I don't believe

01:31:53,329 --> 01:31:58,699
that we currently have a stated

01:31:55,579 --> 01:32:02,210
accessibility policy community code of

01:31:58,699 --> 01:32:04,789
conduct conflict of interest policy code

01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:08,420
of ethics diversity and inclusion policy

01:32:04,789 --> 01:32:10,789
or privacy policy between the foundation

01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:13,369
and so my question is two-part the first

01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:16,550
is between Foundation and the project

01:32:13,369 --> 01:32:17,840
who would be responsible for assisting

01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:20,630
us in creating and enacting those

01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:23,570
policies and the second part is how as

01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:25,519
we as a community how can we help make

01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:26,989
this happen and try to enact some of

01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:31,269
these policies over the next 12 months

01:32:26,989 --> 01:32:31,269
that is a good question

01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,800
one thing I do think we do have some of

01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:39,500
those policies in place like definitely

01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,820
we have a privacy policy so we do have

01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,949
some of those already maybe we need to

01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:44,510
make them more discoverable yeah I don't

01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:47,449
believe that they're published I'm on

01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:49,520
the core contributor for privacy and

01:32:47,449 --> 01:32:51,350
we've been working as a team on it but I

01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,320
don't believe that it's been finalized

01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:55,750
and published yet let's make sure it

01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,890
should be in the footer of wordpress.org

01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:01,280
but I believe had one of those for a

01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:03,890
little while for the others I would say

01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:07,400
that the first priority is always making

01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:08,930
sure that what the purpose of each of

01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,480
those policies is that WordPress is

01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:15,130
embodying and I'm very proud with the

01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:18,680
improvements we made to all those areas

01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:20,449
in the past year and beyond you know

01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:23,360
especially particularly accessibility

01:33:20,449 --> 01:33:26,090
and that's is in spite of there being a

01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:29,180
policy or not we've tried to enact

01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:32,020
bigger changes in WordPress in a policy

01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:34,880
first way in the past and to be honest

01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:37,640
it felt nice but doesn't always make

01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:41,060
things actually change so when we've

01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:43,400
said every commit must be X Y Z or

01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:45,170
something like that or just maybe had it

01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,640
as a broad policy like I think we did

01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:50,270
one for accessibility on the theme

01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:51,830
directory once didn't have the same

01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:54,469
impact as when we actually built the

01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:58,219
tools or worked alongside folks to make

01:33:54,469 --> 01:34:00,980
the changes so I do think about that I

01:33:58,219 --> 01:34:02,750
also think about how can we make all

01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:04,910
these policies that be about things that

01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,580
we want people to do not all negative

01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:09,440
framing I was a little it was pretty

01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:10,850
noticeable when you came in here some of

01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,199
you might have noticed like the first

01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:16,040
three things you saw when walking in the

01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:20,020
work camp us were like costumes weapons

01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:22,160
and a code of conduct it's like whoa

01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:23,620
like the little placards for those

01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:26,510
following Ellen at home they're like big

01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:28,580
black and white placard saying what

01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:29,930
wasn't it loud mostly I also want it I

01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,400
think we've always done really well in

01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:33,199
WordPress where we don't try to

01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,790
enumerate every possible thing we don't

01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,290
want people to do but really talk about

01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:38,930
the principles of what we want to create

01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:40,760
together and I would love for us to also

01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:44,220
evolve how we present ourselves at work

01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:48,640
camps to incorporate more of that

01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:50,110
[Applause]

01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,000
in terms of those other policies let's

01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:54,880
talk about tomorrow a contributor day so

01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,830
we can sort of dial in which ones are

01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,720
there versus not and talk about what

01:34:56,830 --> 01:35:01,840
might be a good process for getting the

01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,200
rest out there thank you so much see you

01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,180
then

01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:07,480
all right we're gonna bounce the left's

01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:09,040
hi I'm Alicia from Canada and I was just

01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,600
really happy to see a number of security

01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,400
talks this year and there was one this

01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,350
morning on auto-updates where I learned

01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:17,080
that there's like 80,000 plugins now

01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:18,640
WordPress which is awesome but I work

01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,930
for security we know that a lot of sites

01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,310
get hacked through plug-in

01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:23,440
vulnerabilities not through core

01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:24,850
vulnerabilities so I'm curious about you

01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,770
know the future of auto-updates for

01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:29,140
plugins but my main question is you know

01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:31,020
most users don't know this so how can

01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,950
WordPress in the community better inform

01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:35,080
administrators or maybe even email

01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:37,480
somehow notify them about security risks

01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,550
of delaying plug-in vulnerabilities the

01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,710
potential risks of breaking sites with

01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:44,770
Auto updates and some alternatives like

01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:47,440
virtual patching that is a super good

01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:49,390
question and one of the things that is

01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,780
one of the nine focuses for the year I

01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:53,950
think it's super super super important

01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:55,720
we're laying some groundwork so like

01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:57,700
that admin email I just showed will

01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:59,710
allow us to more we want to use that to

01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:01,000
message people not just about core like

01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,620
we traditionally have but also about the

01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,090
plugins they're using that is part of

01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:05,050
the reason for getting that in and

01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,340
sometimes we have to build the

01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:07,780
foundation before we build the house on

01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,980
top of it so that was one of the things

01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:13,270
that we were has we didn't really have a

01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:16,240
good up-to-date version of over time you

01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:17,530
know very much the hill that were or the

01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,870
mountain we're trying to climb in the

01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:22,210
distance is that you just log into

01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:23,980
WordPress and it's safe secure and you

01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:24,970
get the latest and greatest and you

01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:26,680
shouldn't have to think about whether

01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:29,020
something is a plug-in whether it's in

01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,820
core or as part of your theme whether

01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:32,140
you customize your theme but then

01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:34,120
there's a security update to a different

01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:36,790
part of it like we need ways to handle

01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:38,770
all of these possible cases and update

01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:41,250
at least for our sites that allow us to

01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:45,070
write set the file permissions as such

01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:47,530
as new sites on the web as possible I

01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:50,860
would like to call out and thank the web

01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:51,850
host here so almost every major web host

01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:54,700
certainly all the ones that we promote

01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:57,820
do automatic updates of court

01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,890
for both major and minor releases and it

01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:00,850
has been fantastic both for us because

01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:02,410
that means people are getting the latest

01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:04,240
grace WordPress but also for them

01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:07,090
that means the sites are less likely to

01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:08,770
get hacked or compared a four year old

01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:11,950
version of WordPress to like today's

01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:13,810
proprietary or alternative the other

01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:16,630
thing that I'm starting to see more

01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:17,710
adopt we do this on wordpress.com lots

01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:20,410
of other hosts are starting to do it too

01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,940
it's auto-updating those plugins so if

01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:23,980
you are a web host and you're not

01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:26,950
auto-updating plugins yet figure out how

01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:28,840
to make that opt out and get as many of

01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:32,280
your sites on the latest versions as

01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:34,420
possible it is true that most

01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:36,100
vulnerabilities we've seen and certainly

01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,930
the ones that affected most sites have

01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,940
been in plugins and themes and themes

01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:41,260
are particularly hairy right because

01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:43,780
people might have customized a code

01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:46,480
there but these are it's all just code

01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:48,400
and so for sites that give us the

01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,990
permission to modify these things by the

01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,300
file permissions I think that we'll be

01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,950
able to tackle it it is really really

01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:55,930
impressive what we already have I know

01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:58,930
those of you who are at the auto-update

01:37:55,930 --> 01:38:01,810
panel we had Nathan a few others there

01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:03,220
you know we forget that it wasn't that

01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:05,110
long ago five or six years ago that

01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:08,020
everyone had to update their WordPress

01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:09,580
manually and we now get over a ninety

01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:12,340
nine usually nine eleven point nine nine

01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:14,080
nine point five auto update rate it

01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:16,390
allows us to get usually like sixty

01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:18,670
percent plus of the word presses in the

01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:21,430
world on the latest version within a few

01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:23,740
weeks which is not as good as iOS but

01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:25,690
way better than Android so for

01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,400
as a true platform which WordPress

01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:29,010
really is it is the operating system for

01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:31,510
the web that's gonna power

01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:32,830
so many things that we know now and so

01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,960
many things we can't even imagine yet

01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:36,760
it's so it's really really important

01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,000
that we invest in that auto-update

01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:41,260
mechanism thank you thank you so a great

01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:51,160
place to contribute especially if you

01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:53,050
work on security stuff and so it just

01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:55,090
were really into good work I mean making

01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:58,150
good looks we have a lot of schema

01:38:55,090 --> 01:39:00,190
updates in Guttenberg but our research

01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:03,760
shows that only half of our customers

01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:06,220
use the blog editor and that's hard

01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,700
because that means that we have to

01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:11,950
basically maintain two products and I'm

01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:15,010
wondering if you know how we can

01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:17,530
convince more people to start using the

01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:20,350
blog header because there is a lot of

01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:23,170
negativity surrounding it and we're

01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:26,050
trying to be supportive but it it's it's

01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:27,940
hard to get there and I saw use post

01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:30,160
summary stats it was the post with the

01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:31,600
most comments we have our hats I believe

01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:33,370
I believe you're assuming that every

01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,010
user of classic plugin is not using good

01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:38,530
bird correct no we did research within

01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:43,510
our audience and asked them what are you

01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:45,550
using classic or the blog editor and off

01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:46,060
of them answered we used the classic

01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:49,990
editor

01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:53,770
ah so more of a survey yes yes I know

01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:56,500
surface oh but still it shows that a lot

01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:59,170
of people aren't using it and so we have

01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:01,000
about just by the numbers we think like

01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:03,640
I said almost three times as many are

01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,280
using good and birth or not so we think

01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,930
only about 25% are kind of using the

01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:10,150
classic editor of people who have

01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:11,560
updated and not all of those are using

01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:12,850
the classic editor all the time some of

01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,800
them are switching between Guttenberg

01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:16,990
so it's 25% or below that are still on

01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,850
there I think the way that we get people

01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:21,610
on is first improving Guttenberg yeah

01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:22,810
right there's been so many changes if

01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,970
you're one of those people who's not on

01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:27,160
Gutenberg yet that's okay we're still

01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:29,020
making it better but I please I'd

01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,310
encourage you to take every couple

01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,900
months like every two or three months

01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:33,610
every major word press release try it

01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:36,030
out again and see if the things that

01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:38,999
frustrated you have been addressed

01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:42,119
- I think it's blocks so you notice how

01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:45,269
on that uh that tweet Hanna talked about

01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:48,329
how I really want this cover block I do

01:40:45,269 --> 01:40:51,689
believe that block first adoption will

01:40:48,329 --> 01:40:53,729
really help things and so as for example

01:40:51,689 --> 01:40:54,719
and Yost if just making things up like

01:40:53,729 --> 01:40:56,429
let's say you had a really cool new

01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,809
feature that was Gutenberg only that

01:40:56,429 --> 01:41:00,389
would be a great reason for people to

01:40:57,809 --> 01:41:01,889
upgrade though I say that knowing that

01:41:00,389 --> 01:41:03,300
you all have done as much to contribute

01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:04,889
a good burgers like anyone else in the

01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,329
world so actually a quick round of

01:41:04,889 --> 01:41:13,800
applause because it's pound for pound

01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:15,449
Yost gives more back than anyone I CEO I

01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:19,050
know a lot of that do to you so thank

01:41:15,449 --> 01:41:21,599
you so I think that is what's gonna

01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:23,999
drive him along but also let's recognize

01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:26,309
that we're only a year in we've got

01:41:23,999 --> 01:41:28,139
seventy five percent that last twenty

01:41:26,309 --> 01:41:30,809
five percent will probably it would be

01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:33,300
like a parabolic curve but I do think

01:41:30,809 --> 01:41:36,090
that I mean we still have ten percent on

01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:39,019
for whose prior to five point six at PHP

01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:42,449
so I do think that will kind of a submit

01:41:39,019 --> 01:41:44,070
asymptotic Li approach like eighty five

01:41:42,449 --> 01:41:45,719
ninety percent and that's the point when

01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:47,489
it's plug-in developers I would say you

01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:52,409
can really focus on Gutenberg first for

01:41:47,489 --> 01:41:53,880
everything I would be very surprised I

01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:55,679
mean we'll check this next year we can

01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:58,139
update all these stats I'd be very

01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:00,590
surprised if not 90% or more of all new

01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:02,039
posts going in WordPress next year or

01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:04,079
we're good bird

01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:05,849
so hey look but we got a lot of work to

01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,949
do yeah right because it I think of it

01:42:05,849 --> 01:42:10,229
also some of the stuff like real-time

01:42:07,949 --> 01:42:11,669
co-editing right I could see that being

01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:13,679
a really compelling feature for people

01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:15,419
that'll help them make the leap it's a

01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:18,119
good bird and of course in Gutenberg you

01:42:15,419 --> 01:42:20,039
can still use a classic block so you can

01:42:18,119 --> 01:42:21,809
actually still have almost exactly the

01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:23,820
same interface inside a Gutenberg so

01:42:21,809 --> 01:42:26,959
there's there's lots of reasons pre blob

01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:30,239
great thank you thank you very much

01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:33,539
let's see over here check time all right

01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:36,179
hello I'm Millie nerds up from Serbia so

01:42:33,539 --> 01:42:40,880
I'm raised born and raised in communism

01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:40,880
and now we try to survive democracy

01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:49,340
me too yeah well the second part so

01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:52,610
looking at open source project the idea

01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:55,400
to me is closer to communism but I

01:42:52,610 --> 01:43:03,530
wouldn't advise applying that but also

01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:08,390
democracy doesn't work so yeah so my

01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:11,990
question is looking at WordPress I don't

01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:14,990
see any system there and I wonder when

01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:19,100
will we see some something that we can

01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:22,780
identify as a system for making plans

01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:27,080
making decisions what are the names

01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:29,530
something like that that's a good

01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,530
question

01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:33,650
I'll take at face value all your value

01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:37,970
statements on different political

01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:39,680
systems and say that WordPress is gonna

01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:42,140
look different and maybe none of the

01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,020
political analogies directly apply

01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:47,930
because it is software and so there are

01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:50,960
other open-source projects that have

01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:52,280
some kind of system yeah it works I

01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,260
think we should call what we do the

01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:57,260
WordPress system ok yeah that's like

01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:58,940
when we see it it was actually one of

01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,350
the I know the WP governance project

01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:02,030
kind of fizzled out but one of the great

01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:04,940
outcomes I think was there kind of

01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:07,610
documented how decisions get made the

01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:10,040
team structures for doing so the good

01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:13,730
news is that you know basically

01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:16,700
everything except you know like choosing

01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:19,670
the Jazz name for a release happens in a

01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:22,700
slack or p2 or github or track channel

01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:25,190
somewhere is even yeah there's a

01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:27,020
contributor to WordPress I was talking

01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:29,120
with and they were like ah you know what

01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:30,650
happened that about page got made and

01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,250
like the secret process I want to be

01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,510
part of it

01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:34,190
and didn't realize that that all had

01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:36,110
just happened on track so almost

01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:37,190
everything you see happens as part of an

01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:39,830
open process so there's a lot of

01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:41,420
transparency and so so the actual

01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:43,310
organizational structure I think that

01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:45,320
it's changed in the past it will change

01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:46,790
in the future for depending on who's

01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:49,670
contributing their strengths and

01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:51,130
weaknesses and what all organizational

01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:53,560
structures are a series of trade-offs

01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:57,220
so what we're trying to optimize for the

01:44:53,560 --> 01:45:00,190
time so prior to when I took back over

01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:01,630
we have a lead lead role we would say

01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,070
that for each release there was a

01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,630
release lead that ultimate authority

01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:05,920
including over myself

01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:08,710
for what was going to be in that release

01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,420
and you know the buck stopped there for

01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:13,360
everything and what we were trying to do

01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:14,710
there was increase the sort of

01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,590
flexibility that release leads had

01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:19,090
because we got into space where releases

01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:21,370
were a little more incremental and want

01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:23,590
people to feel the autonomy to do bigger

01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:26,590
things so I would say that kind of like

01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:28,540
an outfit you try on four different

01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:29,950
outcomes that you're looking for and

01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:31,450
these different organizational

01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:33,160
structures will try different things for

01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:35,500
different parts of WordPress the key

01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:37,330
that for everything we do I think will

01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,830
be that transparency yeah and of course

01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:40,510
that were open source at the end of it

01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:41,530
so that the product is something just

01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:42,400
like that film was Creative Commons

01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:44,050
that's so cool

01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,840
that whatever we create as a community

01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:52,840
is available to the community as well

01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:54,730
thank you so much thank you we needed if

01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:57,070
you have any good words for that to like

01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:59,260
what is kind of a transparent do

01:45:57,070 --> 01:46:02,620
accuracy or something like that all of

01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:05,050
these words have trade-offs so hi my

01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:07,870
name is Paul Wilson I'm from Hawaii I

01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:09,670
actually came here on another conference

01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:11,410
but I think most of your Southern

01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:13,270
California automatic employees were on

01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:16,150
my same plane cool and I learned about

01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:23,020
this word camp so I jumped over to

01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:25,570
yourself but I teach digital

01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:29,560
entrepreneurship at a university in

01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:31,690
Hawaii and WordPress historically has

01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,810
been the main thing that we go to and so

01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:38,020
I have two questions that deal with that

01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:39,400
in particularly first is the bullet

01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:42,700
point I want to make sure I got it right

01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:44,920
from your presentation implementing full

01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:48,370
site editing that kind of slipped in

01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:50,830
there at the end and and I feel that's

01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:52,810
what's really been eating at WordPress

01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:54,610
is market share is you have Wix Weebly

01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:56,830
all the other ones that I see my

01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:58,750
students gravitating more because they

01:46:56,830 --> 01:47:02,020
like the customization of being able to

01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:03,670
edit full site without being just

01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:07,900
restricted to themes

01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:10,000
and so my question on that one is we've

01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:13,000
seen Acuras acquisitions in the past

01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,310
such as WooCommerce where you brought

01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,040
them in and we see think tools like

01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:21,040
dippy element or page layer that already

01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:23,230
have all of that in place is that

01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:25,510
something that you guys would consider

01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:28,270
to help make it more competitive and

01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:29,350
make it more realistic for people that

01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:31,510
are just getting started

01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:33,780
where they can customize without having

01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:36,909
to be locked in theme-wise

01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:39,850
totally so a good way to look at it

01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:42,460
there there's probably at least 25 that

01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:45,580
I looked at of these page builders that

01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:48,250
would each have its own data model at

01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:50,199
each way of doing things for solving

01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:52,510
this problem that you're you said so

01:47:50,199 --> 01:47:54,719
part of why we started Gutenberg was to

01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:58,570
provide them kinda like a common rails

01:47:54,719 --> 01:48:00,340
that they could all build on top of so

01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:02,469
page builders I don't think are going

01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:05,080
anywhere but they won't need to reinvent

01:48:02,469 --> 01:48:07,179
the wheel of the basics like the core

01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:08,739
CMS stuff that'll now be handled inside

01:48:07,179 --> 01:48:10,810
a guru they can build on top of that and

01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:13,480
create lots of cool things outside of

01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:15,010
their the full site editing is basically

01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:17,260
the realization of the original promise

01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:19,320
of Gutenberg which is what we wanted to

01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:21,580
do was essentially flatten WordPress

01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,570
take all these different concepts that

01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:24,760
you would learn in different places

01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:27,010
around WordPress and make them all

01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:29,739
blocks so you could learn a block once

01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:32,500
and you knew that anywhere and what

01:48:29,739 --> 01:48:34,300
we're doing and with the customization

01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,190
face is breaking out the postbox so

01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,600
right now all those blocks we showed if

01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:39,580
I default you can just have inside

01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,679
poster pages we want you to have that in

01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:43,480
headers footers sidebars wherever you

01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,460
want so we're doing a lot of the work

01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:46,630
there to pour things over there's some

01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:48,100
more that needs to be done like

01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:51,880
navigation block is still not finished

01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:53,800
it's a very complex interaction but

01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:55,750
certainly by this time next year and

01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,550
hopefully in the early part of next year

01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:59,830
we'll have it so your students and

01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:01,780
yourself will be able to take like I

01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:04,330
said look at any site on the web and

01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:06,730
just using some blocks maybe the 2020

01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:08,170
theme be able to recreate that so that

01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:10,810
is a hundred percent where we're going

01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:12,460
we're not going as far as I know not

01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:13,810
going to acquire these plugins but you

01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,469
also need to write because the plugins

01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,260
are going to contain

01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:19,360
and they're now gonna be able to move

01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:21,219
faster and work together more which is

01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,349
also something we hear users say because

01:49:21,219 --> 01:49:25,329
the past like choosing one of these is

01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:26,889
almost like locking yourself in to a

01:49:25,329 --> 01:49:27,909
particular way of doing things if you

01:49:26,889 --> 01:49:29,050
want to use a different theme or

01:49:27,909 --> 01:49:31,659
something else that's not compatible

01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:33,369
you're still locked in so this is a very

01:49:31,659 --> 01:49:35,229
user centric model of trying to create

01:49:33,369 --> 01:49:37,780
solve this problem for the entire work

01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:39,389
force ecosystem so on this sick all

01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:42,400
right we got a lot of people waiting so

01:49:39,389 --> 01:49:43,659
really quick on the well it's not a

01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,130
really quick question I'll let you jump

01:49:43,659 --> 01:49:49,289
over to thank you for your time thank

01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:52,690
you hello hello and you've got the mic

01:49:49,289 --> 01:49:56,499
hi Matt Michelle aim is from WP AWP

01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:57,909
coffee talk and I would like to lighten

01:49:56,499 --> 01:50:00,369
this up for just a quick second and ask

01:49:57,909 --> 01:50:02,650
you a fun question mm-hmm I ask every

01:50:00,369 --> 01:50:04,329
guest of my podcast what's the biggest

01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,559
mistake you've ever made with WordPress

01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:09,360
and what did you learn from it and

01:50:05,559 --> 01:50:09,360
what's your proudest WordPress moment

01:50:11,729 --> 01:50:17,999
the biggest mistake is the longest a

01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:20,139
longer story but there was a hot nacho

01:50:17,999 --> 01:50:21,550
episode is what it was referred to

01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:23,429
hopefully most people in the room

01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:27,249
haven't heard of it if you have but

01:50:23,429 --> 01:50:29,380
super early on with WordPress it was

01:50:27,249 --> 01:50:30,579
basically like completely unfunded and I

01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:32,409
had like run out of money we were

01:50:30,579 --> 01:50:34,780
getting hired a designer to redesign the

01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:36,760
logo actually Jason santamaría who did

01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:38,199
do the logo we currently use but then

01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:40,119
ran out before he was going to do phases

01:50:38,199 --> 01:50:42,249
two and three which were redesigning the

01:50:40,119 --> 01:50:44,349
website in the WP admin anyway long

01:50:42,249 --> 01:50:46,360
story short like someone paid us to put

01:50:44,349 --> 01:50:46,929
paid me to put these links on the

01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,420
website

01:50:46,929 --> 01:50:52,389
we're totally spammy but as kind of a

01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:55,479
for web spam was a thing and also might

01:50:52,389 --> 01:50:58,539
have inadvertently like been invented

01:50:55,479 --> 01:51:00,519
but certainly popularized a way to hide

01:50:58,539 --> 01:51:05,019
content using CSS that Google was not

01:51:00,519 --> 01:51:06,820
yet aware and so that was definitely the

01:51:05,019 --> 01:51:07,510
worst thing I've done to WordPress and

01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:10,830
the web

01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:13,800
[Laughter]

01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:16,620
my initial penance for that was creating

01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:18,000
Akismet was which was to create

01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:21,270
something to fight web spam especially

01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,940
which I understood the people were doing

01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:26,429
there but then hopefully the 15 years of

01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:28,620
WordPress following that and one of the

01:51:26,429 --> 01:51:30,929
proud you know I get incredibly proud

01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:34,080
every time we come together for these

01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:37,050
big work camps US Europe and last year

01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,250
having 5.0 ship and being able to talk

01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:41,190
about it and see how the community came

01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:42,870
together and I mean that really was the

01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:45,120
biggest change we've made in our 16-year

01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:46,889
history and this idea of going from kind

01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:49,949
of a document model to a block model of

01:51:46,889 --> 01:51:51,750
editing is it's impossible to overstate

01:51:49,949 --> 01:51:53,850
how important that is to the future of

01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:55,440
WordPress so seeing how that came

01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:58,290
together and how we iterated in public

01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:00,870
how it was all that happened definitely

01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:01,380
one my proudest WordPress moments thank

01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:08,550
you

01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:12,480
I meant my name is wolf Bishop I'm a

01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:13,320
with WP top hat and I live right here in

01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,949
southeast Missouri

01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:18,630
cool so kind of home for me I'm gonna

01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:20,940
kind of screw up the trend that she just

01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:25,260
tried to set up with a bit of a more

01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:26,550
controversial subject so um there's we

01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:28,980
one of the greatest things about

01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:31,159
WordPress is the fact that it's released

01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:33,900
under the GPL which means we can use

01:52:31,159 --> 01:52:35,699
redistribute change plugins themes

01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:38,639
anything that's released under that

01:52:35,699 --> 01:52:40,820
license as much as we want either for

01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:44,489
free or profit and we love that about it

01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:47,880
this has brought about a trend of a

01:52:44,489 --> 01:52:51,210
growing trend of companies known as GPL

01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:55,050
clubs which redistribute plugins either

01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:56,670
free or for profit and there's a lot of

01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:59,130
controversy in the community about this

01:52:56,670 --> 01:53:00,810
some people are absolutely for it and

01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:04,770
others are definitely against it and

01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:07,500
this kind of attitude is mixed between

01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:08,940
both plugin or developers as well as any

01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:11,040
users I've spoken to developers who

01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:13,290
support it developers who are against it

01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,120
the same with end users so I think the

01:53:13,290 --> 01:53:18,060
community might like to know what is

01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:20,160
your official or unofficial opinion

01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:23,590
about these types of companies

01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:25,810
sure first and foremost they'll say it's

01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:29,110
allowed by the license so it's something

01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:31,570
that is there's no other case if I'm

01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:33,520
aware of like that's the license when we

01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:35,380
create GPL software is explicitly with

01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,970
that freedom and we couldn't prevent

01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:38,830
folks like that from doing it without

01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:40,780
taking a lot of freedoms away from

01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:42,700
everyone here in there was this room so

01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,780
it's one of those uncomfortable almost

01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:46,510
like the first amendment in the Bill of

01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:49,200
Rights like sometimes it's uncomfortable

01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:52,510
but it's really really really important

01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:53,800
my personal view on it is that you know

01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:55,900
the customers there will get what they

01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:58,870
pay for yes they can get a hundred

01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:00,490
plugins well one it's weird in the first

01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:02,140
place but if they're their price

01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:04,090
sensitive but they're not supporting you

01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:06,070
those developers they're not practicing

01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:07,510
fire for the future in their own case by

01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:11,290
voting with their wallet for the

01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:14,080
software that they use sport that I mean

01:54:11,290 --> 01:54:16,030
I I've started now where I pay for stuff

01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:18,340
I don't even need to pay for you know

01:54:16,030 --> 01:54:19,990
donations or patreon or stuff like that

01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:24,940
just because I want to see more of it in

01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:26,230
the world how you spend your money is

01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:28,540
just as important as how you spend your

01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:31,030
time and any other resource you're

01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:31,990
supporting a certain worldview you're

01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,850
going to encourage more of whatever

01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:35,410
you're paying for it to happen so if

01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:37,000
you're seeing companies like some of the

01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:38,980
ones we've mentioned today that are

01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,050
given a lot back to WordPress doing a

01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:42,490
GPL creating great user experiences

01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:44,500
supporting Gutenberg all that sort of

01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:45,910
stuff even if you don't need to maybe

01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:47,950
just pick up their yearly license or

01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:49,360
something and think of that as a way of

01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:52,270
supporting more of what you want to see

01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:54,040
in the world and you know for these

01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:55,330
companies that are kind of taking lots

01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:58,240
of people's work but not really given

01:54:55,330 --> 01:55:01,000
much back it's those core things or two

01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:04,060
core may be pleased to say that I'm from

01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:08,770
a different generation from most of the

01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:12,460
people in the room so my question to you

01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:15,520
is how do you think WordPress or as

01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:18,190
either heart how do you think WordPress

01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:22,060
is gonna be adapted by the next

01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:24,970
generation of kids in K through 12

01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:27,700
schools or how do you think you're gonna

01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:32,200
change the WordPress so that way kids

01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:33,180
and kids through 12 schools will want to

01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:36,030
learn or

01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:39,210
and I want to join the local WordPress

01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:48,690
meetups like how they joined robotics

01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:50,010
and different things thank you well

01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:51,240
first thank you

01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:54,720
I believe Olivia you were one of the

01:55:51,240 --> 01:56:00,180
speakers that's working right yeah very

01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:02,850
modest so the example that you're

01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:04,850
setting is something that inspires so

01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:07,500
this is gonna be on YouTube later and

01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:10,530
boys and girls maybe of your generation

01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:12,360
will see you here asking a question

01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,000
being a speaker at work camp in front of

01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,920
a thousand adults and you know it's kind

01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,920
of beautiful when I got start with

01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:21,900
WordPress I was my team and you know the

01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,380
old comic and The New Yorker are like on

01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:26,580
the internet no one knows you're a dog I

01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:28,590
would think like it's great on the

01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:30,060
internet no one knows that I'm a 19 year

01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:31,920
old kid in Houston who doesn't have a

01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:35,520
comp high degree and like is learning a

01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,110
coach people just were looking at the

01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,510
code I was creating and we started

01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:41,820
working together and were able to create

01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:44,160
something that became a community came

01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:45,840
except ours a lot of the web and that

01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:48,240
I'm still decided to work on every

01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,800
single day when I wake up so those

01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,870
examples being out there I think really

01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:52,980
help hero press stories and probably

01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:57,120
need some more younger folks on hero

01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:58,500
press Seto for somewhere here you know

01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,570
just kind of get more of that out there

01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:02,730
kids camps I think will help and finally

01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:04,770
you know we need to well this isn't

01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:06,660
finally we need to make WordPress easier

01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:07,920
and more accessible that will help with

01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,840
younger generations as well as all the

01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,860
generations and the last plug I'll put

01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,740
in there is you know something that

01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:16,110
happens this year was automatic which is

01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:18,000
my company bought tumblr and we

01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:20,900
announced that we're gonna switch all

01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,310
that to WordPress so there's going to be

01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:25,020
half a billion more word presses in the

01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:27,090
world and tumblr definitely has a

01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:28,890
younger audience on it as its primary

01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:31,050
user base and so I'm very very excited

01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:32,070
as you know it's not gonna be the first

01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:33,900
year but probably the second or third

01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:37,560
year as those become WordPress on the

01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:39,120
back ends tumblr.com can be like a react

01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:41,010
front end talking to the WordPress API

01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:42,570
and you can have a different user

01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:45,960
interface on top of that

01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:47,250
and those folks much like before

01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,320
WordPress there's a generation that

01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:51,480
learned to code you know CSS from

01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:53,940
MySpace and things like by going where

01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:55,320
there's a lot of youth activity

01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:58,200
happening already and it's pretty fun

01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:00,210
site as well the customization in the

01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:01,680
path we have there could allow them to

01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:03,750
graduate to being WordPress and maybe

01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:07,770
graduate being someone as cool as you

01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:10,070
talk about working up someday thank you

01:58:07,770 --> 01:58:10,070
so much

01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:21,269
I met Becky Davis from Chicago and I've

01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:23,670
been doing this a long time

01:58:21,269 --> 01:58:25,440
I have sites that are out there that are

01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:27,239
six and seven and eight years old and

01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,400
I'm still maintaining them and they have

01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:32,789
thousands and thousands and thousands of

01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:34,650
both in multiple languages and you want

01:58:32,789 --> 01:58:39,989
me to switch over to Gutenberg are you

01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:42,420
kidding me so you but you don't have to

01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:44,460
rush so my real question is I've heard

01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:48,989
rumors that the classic editor is going

01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:51,960
to die in the future please tell me

01:58:48,989 --> 01:58:56,070
that's not true what did we officially

01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:57,329
announce for a classic editor 2022 yeah

01:58:56,070 --> 01:59:01,409
that's not cool

01:58:57,329 --> 01:59:04,230
yeah well there's a lot gonna change

01:59:01,409 --> 01:59:06,449
between now and 2020 - in the world in

01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:08,900
general like we'll all be like doing

01:59:06,449 --> 01:59:11,880
work camp on Holograms or something but

01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:14,130
so we I think it went from good burger

01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,780
release we said four or five years that

01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:17,130
we announced at that point that we were

01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:19,739
going to continually maintain the

01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:22,230
classic editor plugin in reality an open

01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:24,929
source when things have usage it gets

01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:27,749
maintained and so classic editor still

01:59:24,929 --> 01:59:28,769
has a couple million users by 2022 guess

01:59:27,749 --> 01:59:30,960
what it's gonna keep going guess what

01:59:28,769 --> 01:59:32,639
we're gonna still work on it if it makes

01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,409
you feel any better again but we don't

01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:36,090
want to promise that it's just because

01:59:34,409 --> 01:59:37,769
that doesn't encourage what we want to

01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:39,449
happen which is people start to adopt

01:59:37,769 --> 01:59:41,550
and so hopefully some of the site's

01:59:39,449 --> 01:59:43,139
there six or seven years old maybe as

01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:45,059
you start to update them for a new

01:59:43,139 --> 01:59:46,739
design or something else that could be

01:59:45,059 --> 01:59:48,239
an opportunity to also bring them over

01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:50,849
to guru or maybe there's something there

01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:53,190
users or you as a developer want to

01:59:50,849 --> 01:59:55,170
bring in like I definitely by the way I

01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:59,159
have WordPress is there 16 and 17 years

01:59:55,170 --> 02:00:00,599
old and it's been kind of fun to go back

01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:03,420
and see like things that I used to have

02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:05,670
to custom code or have a lot of HTML and

02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:07,440
it's gonna be custom the CSS I now

02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:09,599
recreate in Gutenberg that's a little

02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:11,400
bit work it's also really it's kind of

02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:12,630
interesting and I learn as I do it and I

02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:14,610
know it's gonna be forward compatible

02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:18,090
because Gutenberg 100% is the future of

02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:19,260
WordPress so if you were to ask me 20

02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:22,019
years from now is there still a classic

02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:23,469
editor I mean I hope not but only

02:00:22,019 --> 02:00:27,290
because no one wants to use

02:00:23,469 --> 02:00:29,390
so sometime in between there its usage

02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:30,949
will dwindle to the point where it'll

02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:32,960
maybe either be an issue gun or not

02:00:30,949 --> 02:00:34,760
something officially supported it's

02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:35,690
still open source so that still means

02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:37,730
that people will be able to customize

02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:39,380
however they like there's people who

02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:42,469
only post a wordpress using a command

02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:44,420
line so use that as an example of some

02:00:42,469 --> 02:00:48,560
pretty nice things can still be actively

02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:50,960
supported and maintained but I do

02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:53,360
appreciate if at some point in the

02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:58,570
future you take a look at Guttenberg

02:00:53,360 --> 02:01:02,960
again and try it out projects with

02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:04,909
thousands of pages how do I transfer

02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:11,590
that there's no script of that we should

02:01:04,909 --> 02:01:15,670
make a script for that thing thank you

02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:20,630
our other last couple maybe two or three

02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:23,600
what's up Matt hey hey my name is

02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:27,560
Christy and I have a question for you

02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:30,830
you are a CEO so you know or you have

02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:32,989
consultants that know that a key

02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:34,429
component of any successful project or

02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:37,520
organization is good stakeholder

02:01:34,429 --> 02:01:39,620
management so this idea that in any

02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,880
group we have a ton of people and a lot

02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:43,040
of the time most the time they have

02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,960
competing interests if we have buyers

02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:46,190
and sellers the buyer wants to get the

02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,570
most money that's other ones they get

02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:50,239
the least money and we have to find a

02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:53,480
place in between I think we could argue

02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:56,810
that the WordPress open source project

02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:58,610
has even more stake holders than the

02:01:56,810 --> 02:02:00,640
traditional corporate structure that

02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:06,530
maybe hasn't placed by sellers

02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:12,020
shareholders I'm curious what we're

02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:13,010
doing in 2020 and Beyond to bring all of

02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:15,800
the different people with different

02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:17,989
motivations together in the WordPress

02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:21,070
project to work towards a common goal

02:02:17,989 --> 02:02:24,290
the questions that we see here

02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:25,690
demonstrate I can probably list about

02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:29,199
seven different kinds of stakeholders

02:02:25,690 --> 02:02:31,699
mm-hmm yeah with different motivations

02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:34,159
different incentives different things

02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:36,830
they want to see how do we get everybody

02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:39,050
working towards that same goal of

02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:41,690
what we saw in the video just making the

02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:45,490
project in the world a better place that

02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:48,110
is a good question and I am so relieved

02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:50,990
you defined what stakeholder management

02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:54,110
was because from over there I'm like man

02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:56,090
I'm a terrible CEO I have no idea what

02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:58,370
she means by that so you gotta think

02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:59,660
andrew nason for that one cuz he texted

02:02:58,370 --> 02:03:01,100
me and said what's your question and I

02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:03,340
said it and he goes you gotta define

02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:06,610
stakeholder management ah

02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:06,610
thanks Andy

02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:14,720
yeah so I'm maybe not the most corporate

02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:16,280
CEO ever in terms of but I do think

02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:17,690
about that problem quite a bit which is

02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:19,790
there are so many people with different

02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:21,410
types of interests different incentives

02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:23,150
different motivations different things

02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:27,650
that are important to them special

02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:30,020
interest within WordPress and you know

02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:32,900
it can be cacophonous sometimes right

02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:34,190
like all the voices in the room I also

02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:36,980
think as part of what makes WordPress

02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:40,100
beautiful and exciting is that those

02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:42,620
voices occasionally come together and

02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:44,060
create like a chorus or we can all go in

02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:46,070
the same direction we're never gonna

02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,360
make everyone happy and not everyone's

02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:48,950
ever gonna agree with all of our

02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:50,570
decisions I'm sure there's many things I

02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:51,770
presented today that a lot of people

02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:52,760
would strongly agree with or say it

02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:54,770
would be bad for the web

02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,150
there's opposite of our goals but what

02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:59,120
we do try to do is put our philosophy

02:03:56,150 --> 02:04:00,860
out there of what we're trying to do the

02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:02,570
web that we want to see and the things

02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:03,560
that are really core to us I came up in

02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:05,900
an earlier question things like

02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:07,730
transparency and open source and then

02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:11,180
say if those are also important to you

02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:14,060
you know get on the bus and we'll take

02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:15,950
this journey together if not guess what

02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:18,950
it's open source so you can still you

02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:22,820
can great evil press or something and

02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:23,990
I'm sure it's open source you can fork

02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:25,820
it you can change it you can take the

02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:28,970
code you cannot fork it you can use it

02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:30,860
for whatever purpose you like and and so

02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:33,800
you're not forced but if you do want to

02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:35,000
be part of this what I would term or the

02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:39,110
community of people contributing to

02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,850
WordPress we do have to think about how

02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:42,320
we present things so it's stay to the

02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:44,510
word but it's also what happens at

02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:47,510
meetups what goes on the blog what gets

02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:49,340
translated and so the 50-plus languages

02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:51,860
that WordPress is translated into it

02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:56,240
very much is a global and multifactorial

02:04:51,860 --> 02:05:01,370
problem that is part of the fun of it

02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:03,950
it's I was listening to a I was I think

02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:06,980
it's a podcast with poster guy that does

02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:08,510
the documentary is like Vietnam jazz Ken

02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:10,880
Burns write the one that has awesome pan

02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:13,880
effect how cool that he has effect built

02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,350
into a movie like to be a director to

02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:18,590
have that your name and then effect

02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:20,060
someday and he was talking about they

02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:23,330
have this neon sign in their editing

02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:27,710
room and I'm gonna butcher it I think it

02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:29,660
said it's complex because every he

02:05:27,710 --> 02:05:32,510
covers these really interesting rich

02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:34,880
stories and for everything that is kind

02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:36,770
of a surface story by the kind of tweet

02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,390
version but you can say about what

02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:42,380
happened and got something like the

02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:43,880
Civil War or music called jazz but the

02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:47,180
reality is it's really really complex

02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:49,040
and I try to I thought about getting

02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,480
like a neon thing that said that from my

02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:52,580
office after I heard that Bacchus I

02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:55,070
think it was a podcast he recorded Tim

02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:58,810
Ferriss if you want to check it out so

02:05:55,070 --> 02:06:01,539
thank you for your question thank you

02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:03,940
all right next to last

02:06:01,539 --> 02:06:05,440
him at my name is Jeremy Ward I'm a

02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:08,559
senior back in engineer with web dev

02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:10,900
studios and I was excited to see in your

02:06:08,559 --> 02:06:12,909
presentation today and was aware of the

02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:15,250
decision last year to upgrade the

02:06:12,909 --> 02:06:17,920
minimum version of PHP and it's great to

02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:21,190
hear 83% adoption I believe you said it

02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:23,590
was already pre-press my point - so 83%

02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:25,090
of people on WordPress 5.2 are running

02:06:23,590 --> 02:06:27,820
PHP 7 or higher

02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:30,010
right exactly hey cool that's awesome

02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:31,809
the goal for this year as I understand

02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:34,510
it was to get the minimum version of

02:06:31,809 --> 02:06:36,789
WordPress on to seven plus and of course

02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:40,199
I think it's next month that security

02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:44,380
updates for 7.1 and I'm just wondering

02:06:40,199 --> 02:06:45,699
if you can elaborate on like the 10% the

02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:48,219
laggards the ones that are still on the

02:06:45,699 --> 02:06:49,599
old versions and in the conversations

02:06:48,219 --> 02:06:51,280
that you are planning on having with web

02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:55,360
host to get them up to date so that we

02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:57,849
can push everything forward sure so one

02:06:55,360 --> 02:07:00,579
common bit of info that a lot of people

02:06:57,849 --> 02:07:03,579
don't know is that web hosts that were

02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:05,170
running older versions of PHP that the

02:07:03,579 --> 02:07:06,849
PHP project itself was no longer

02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:08,139
officially supporting we're still

02:07:06,849 --> 02:07:09,909
getting back ported security fixes

02:07:08,139 --> 02:07:11,079
usually from third-party companies that

02:07:09,909 --> 02:07:11,349
they would subscribe to or things like

02:07:11,079 --> 02:07:13,840
that

02:07:11,349 --> 02:07:15,159
so although 7.0 will no longer be

02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,019
officially supported by the PHP project

02:07:15,159 --> 02:07:18,820
it's a little bit like when we say we

02:07:17,019 --> 02:07:19,719
don't want to support all this they just

02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:21,400
don't want to have to deal with it they

02:07:19,719 --> 02:07:24,280
want to focus on making it a new thing

02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:26,320
but there you know web hosts often

02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:28,059
subscriber services and they'll be those

02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:29,860
people will still have PHP security

02:07:28,059 --> 02:07:32,440
updates so it's not actually as end of

02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:36,969
life as a PHP project would like you to

02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:39,309
the feel in terms of what we need to do

02:07:36,969 --> 02:07:43,510
to pick up those old people not old

02:07:39,309 --> 02:07:46,510
people people on old versions of I made

02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:49,750
a generational mistake there people on

02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:51,730
old versions of PHP is we had to work

02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:54,489
with the hosts you know it's really

02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:56,500
something where you know apart from a

02:07:54,489 --> 02:07:58,510
small handful that might be running like

02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:59,920
servers in their closet and on their

02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:02,739
home connect like pretty much everyone

02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:04,809
runs WordPress on a web host on a server

02:08:02,739 --> 02:08:08,219
image on there's a great web host that

02:08:04,809 --> 02:08:08,219
sponsor work camps and

02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:12,760
so one thing we're looking to start

02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:15,100
doing is its are identifying which host

02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:16,390
or have those older versions and just

02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:17,770
use that to talk to them they might not

02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:20,110
even know themselves that they have

02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:23,200
still have half a million word press is

02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:25,030
still on PHP 5.6 or something so if we

02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,920
can expose that to them and kind of

02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:29,350
offer the best practices of what we've

02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:30,790
seen folks do to upgrade by the way this

02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:32,500
is also an area where I've seen direct

02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:33,760
competitors hosts that competed with

02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:35,680
each other for same customers actually

02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:36,820
help each other out and open source of

02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,380
scripts and things that they used to do

02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:41,170
upgrades Bluehost did some amazing stuff

02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:43,960
there so we can bring these folks along

02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:44,980
but it's not the end user that probably

02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,030
needs to hear at this point because

02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:48,190
they've been seeing the notices and

02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:51,010
everything for a while now it's that we

02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:53,620
need to start working with wherever

02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:55,870
they're paying to host our website great

02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:57,100
thank you thank you all right and we're

02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:58,360
going to end on this one I apologize I

02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:00,340
know there's a few more questions but

02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:02,380
I'm very cognizant a time and for the

02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:03,580
folks that didn't get to it come on up

02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:06,550
afterwards I'm happy to talk to you

02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:07,720
alright so you've got the last question

02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:11,140
please introduce yourself you're the

02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:17,770
celebrity that was on that video no I

02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:19,480
just want to go and I'm at my name is

02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:21,400
Francesca I'm the WordPress community

02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:23,800
manager at SiteGround and right now I

02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:28,380
serve as the release coordinator for

02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:28,380
WordPress 5.3 hopefully

02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:36,940
November 12 right November 12 I'm just

02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:40,690
shouting bossy maybe everyone else is

02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:43,330
doing the work but one thing you have

02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:45,940
executive management skills yes thank

02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:50,110
you thank you I'm also a good listener

02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:52,480
so one thing that came up over the past

02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:55,300
few months in conversations with many

02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:59,650
different people involved in the release

02:09:55,300 --> 02:10:03,190
is that they feel it will be great to

02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:07,330
have a calendar of releases a year long

02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:10,870
a calendar of releases so how do you

02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:13,300
feel about having a calendar for 21 24

02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:16,719
the next because you said yourself three

02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:18,080
releases at best every year so how do

02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:21,470
you feel about having

02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:29,750
calendar for 2020 this is a good one to

02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:32,210
end on ah let's do it thank you

02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:33,830
there's no reason not to we do kind of a

02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:35,750
version of that earlier in the year yeah

02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:37,340
so we might as well map it out as long

02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:40,760
as people realize that those dates might

02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:41,930
move you know you know in The New Yorker

02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:43,040
when they say they're going on is about

02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:44,810
town they're like musicians leave

02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:46,760
complicated lives developers leave

02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:52,640
complicated lives and something else is

02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:54,440
bossing them around but maybe the

02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:57,950
release is you lead will be super on

02:10:54,440 --> 02:11:01,070
time yes well we'll get that nice to see

02:10:57,950 --> 02:11:03,200
and the place that we should have that

02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:04,400
and we have had it a little bit more in

02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:07,370
the past I guess we just fell out of

02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:09,350
updating it would be slash about SAS

02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:11,780
roadmap probably the best place for that

02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:14,330
and that shows the days of previous

02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:16,040
releases the jazzers they chose and then

02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:17,780
we've previously showed some of the

02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:19,100
updating ones but I guess we we fell

02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:22,250
behind there so let's fix that up a

02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:26,180
contributor day that will be done as we

02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:28,640
