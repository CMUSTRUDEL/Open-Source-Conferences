thank you all for being here today as

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,490
she said I'm Alison Osaka which I'm

00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:14,589
coming from the biggest Greek hosting

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,099
provider and the domina register it's

00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:21,910
actually a group of brands and idea and

00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:24,670
we have brands in Serbia it's one in top

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,130
10 hosting companies mint popeck is the

00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,740
biggest Rick dummy register top host his

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,140
biggest dedicated VPS and that kind of

00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,860
stuff reseller the core is the first of

00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,559
all commerce managed WooCommerce hosting

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,559
and hostel the biggest Albanian Nami

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,960
registers so and my job there is to

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,320
track what mint and hostel are doing

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,579
there today we will talk about

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:55,359
e-commerce future because I think that

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:58,750
we are making a huge mistakes while we

00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:02,050
are starting building our e-commerce web

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,750
shops and that the trust is pretty much

00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,930
shaken and that customers are losing

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:11,710
trust in e-commerce and online shops so

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,450
but why that is happening first of all I

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,780
need to say actually I have to say two

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:21,549
things first one I have on disclaimer

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,310
for all of you and I will use the words

00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,549
like crap and when it

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,700
is because there is no other explanation

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:34,390
than to say and crap

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,060
also I have to apologize to the previous

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,720
speaker because he shared a lot of

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,640
statistics and I know that 84% of all

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,890
statistics in presentation are fake

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,189
because speakers are using statistic to

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,280
give more authority to their talks so

00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:56,890
you should know one thing if you see

00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,030
this because I would be an if I

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,950
said that all 84% of something is fake

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,570
and statistics are fake so 84% is also

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,880
fake percentage because I don't have a

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,230
freaking clue what is the percentage of

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,849
fake statistics

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:19,040
and what is bad well the starting point

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:23,300
is really bad when people are starting

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:28,519
with e-commerce web shops and any shop

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,500
business we have one bad manner what

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,140
we're doing like we see that our

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,630
neighbor has a bakery and it's really

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,970
successful bakery and then we open a

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,700
bakery right next to it because we think

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,910
that probably our bakery will be at

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,599
least successful as his bakeries but

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,890
that's not the case so there is

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,049
something that you need to have

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:56,840
different than others in order to

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:59,860
succeed also if you ever listen to some

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,299
talk or read a book from simon Sinek

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:08,720
people are rather will buy what why then

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,700
what what actually that means when you

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,590
are buying a laptop or a mobile phone

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,319
I'm used to Apple

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:22,340
I have macbook air I have iPhone so for

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,769
me I don't look at what is inside the

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,319
computer I don't look what's inside my

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,690
phone so I don't care about processor

00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,650
about the graphic card I only care that

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,989
it's Apple and probably for the lesser

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,230
price I could find some Lenovo or some

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:43,069
Asus eraser or whatever with better

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,840
configuration and better hardware but I

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,700
will go with Apple because I'm buying

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,700
why not what I'm not buying a laptop

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,010
next thing very important is to discover

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,530
what is your competition not who there

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,650
was one great example from denílson in a

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,880
book lean product playbook you can find

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,160
it online as well on Amazon he is

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,620
actually advisor for big companies

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,019
creating software's products and that

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,260
kind of stuff and there was company in

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,389
u.s. they were creating software for

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,000
submitting your tax report every year

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,570
personal tax report and in u.s. it's a

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
big deal

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,419
they're keeping every invoice they paid

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,150
paid something all receipts I read

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,550
they keep so they can deduct that amount

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,419
from their tax at the end of the year

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,219
and they created a software to do that

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:40,020
to make her life easier less miserable

00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:43,930
because you're doing that every day and

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,779
what they did they discovered that there

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,499
are two companies two software's in u.s.

00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:52,629
doing the same thing similar so they

00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,330
were thinking what to offer more than

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,509
those two companies to have more users

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,090
and to take some market share from them

00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,789
but then then Olson came and changed

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:10,110
completely philosophy because

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:13,000
competition hold only 2% of US citizens

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,069
98 percent of US citizens were using

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,779
something completely different so

00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:23,289
competition was what not who can you

00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:27,729
imagine what was the competition the

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:30,370
pencil and the paper 98 percent of US

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,610
citizens were using pencil and the paper

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,250
and only 2 percent of US citizens were

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:40,360
using any software so it's not a point

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:43,330
to take some customers that already use

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,219
some software from your competition then

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,120
to take customers that are not using any

00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:50,860
software's to find a way how to explain

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,139
to them that it's better to use software

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:58,810
than a pen and the paper also shops with

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,789
unique products are more successful and

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,699
now you will say yes you've just

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:07,930
invented hot water of course that shops

00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:10,659
with unique products will have will be

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,729
more successful but what you can

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:16,589
actually how you can target some

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:20,229
specific groups which are not

00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:22,210
specifically for that product you're not

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,849
targeting that group of people for the

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,250
product but what you offer with that

00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,349
product might target some groups of

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,229
people like eco-friendly products

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,330
eco-friendly packaging no child labor in

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,550
the supply chain which is very hard

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,169
because I believe that today we all have

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,919
something

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:44,340
wearing on us with child labor in supply

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,169
chain and let's say recycling by doing

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,509
this you will target some specific

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,150
groups of people who really really care

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,039
about this stuff and your product is

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:58,860
actually the same as all other products

00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:01,740
in the market what is actually this part

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,770
is the most important one what is

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,409
extremely bad drop shipping became

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,689
Aliexpress so you install WooCommerce

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,789
you buy a plug-in Aliexpress something

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,740
drop shipping or whatever or Shopify

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,199
then you connect it with your website

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,659
you create account in Aliexpress voila

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,789
your drop shipper you have a new

00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:23,569
business your business owner your shop

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:27,900
owner and you you can rock the world

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:33,300
number two are fake shops and number

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:36,139
three is elephant sales margins so I

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:40,139
will give you some examples for this

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:43,680
this is Serbian webshop it's called ship

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,919
rotisseries I don't care if they will be

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,199
mad at me because I'm using them as

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,229
exempt as an example because they're

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,909
 so I am here and you can see

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,250
that the price for shoes was ten

00:07:53,909 --> 00:08:00,479
thousand one hundred and twenty dinners

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:04,969
it's like 85 euros when you convert it

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:08,969
and there is some huge discount of

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:10,819
almost 70 percent if you buy it in the

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,409
next six hours

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:16,050
because they are so cool and they want

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:19,129
to give you some huge discount on that

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,639
pair of shoes first of all if you google

00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:26,339
Sterling shoes that brand doesn't exist

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,149
there is no sterling shows on Google so

00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,599
they already scammed you selling your

00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,969
Sterling shoes that doesn't exist and

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:41,130
there was some extremely huge discount

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:43,889
only for the next six hours but then you

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,199
are smart enough to have Aliexpress and

00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:50,689
you can see the same pair of shoes in

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:54,120
the top right corner for 25 US dollars

00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:56,610
so they're trying to scam you from the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,980
very beginning from the first step when

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,379
you visited their website or you found

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,060
their ad on Instagram or Google or

00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:09,720
wherever they started to scam you

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:13,610
another example I wanted to buy a watch

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:17,220
to my girlfriend for birthday because

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,379
the time is pretty much relative to her

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,069
and I wanted to buy something like a

00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,569
joke for a birthday and I look for some

00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:27,360
watches and then of course Instagram

00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:29,579
started to pile me up with ads with

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,160
watches and as you can see here soon to

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,370
watch is 70% off some please Finland

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,769
brand its high-end brand the watches are

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,339
like 1000 euros that is the price for

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:45,509
the wristwatch and the name of the shop

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,309
is Lhasa I'm something okay and I'm

00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:49,230
always clicking on these buttons learn

00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,610
more because you are spending their

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,860
money by doing that because they're

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,209
paying per click so click every time on

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,829
everything because you will spending

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,259
their money and they don't have enough

00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,470
money to spend it if everyone clicks on

00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:05,670
everything and then you got redirected

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:12,170
for to shop l GF o dot M L do you know

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,170
ml from which country is that till they

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:19,500
know it would be good that is Mulder

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:22,740
unfortunately it's Mali in Africa and

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,990
they have a civil war like two years ago

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,339
so if you buy something there do you

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,569
think that you will get your money back

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,269
like ever

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:33,720
no probably if you're from Mali you

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:35,490
would not get your money back so but if

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,769
you click on some of those wristwatches

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:46,290
you get redirected to another website it

00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:48,149
Suunto dot online and it was not hard to

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,269
me to find a real price for this

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:55,439
wristwatch and in Serbia this is

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:58,709
official authorized reseller of some

00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:01,259
torches in Serbia is it was fifty five

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,400
thousand dinners visitors around 500

00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,380
euros so that is the regular

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,780
price for that watch and it was

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:12,750
discounted price on their website but

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:17,050
then you have it for 16 pounds for

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:19,480
staggering 97.1% of discount on the

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:23,170
regular price and they said that it was

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:27,280
70% of on Instagram so they lied

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,380
themselves you see what they're doing

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,340
and if you buy this watch you are

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,680
probably because if you're if

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,860
you have two grams of brain inside your

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,650
head you will not click Add to Cart

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,720
because no one can sell you a wristwatch

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:49,360
that costs five hundred and fifty pounds

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:53,400
416 pounds because even what is the name

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,240
of that part that goes around your hand

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,720
wrist yes

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:03,790
cost more wristband cost more than 16

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:07,740
pounds for that watch elephant sales

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:10,930
margin this is when I was looking to buy

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:17,590
some joke wristwatch to my girlfriend

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:21,190
and it's also Serbian it says 15.6 US

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,940
dollars for a wristwatch if you buy two

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:28,960
or more you have a free shipping so if

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:31,720
you spend 30 bucks 31 actually you will

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,330
have free shipping then you go of course

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:40,000
Aliexpress and there is Geneva

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:43,480
wristwatches free shipping for $1 from

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,970
China and this shop is in Serbia so they

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,940
are shipping 100 kilometers or 200

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,370
kilometers and the other guys for $1 are

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,160
shipping four or five thousand

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,950
kilometers for free and they are not

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,920
asking you to buy two wristwatches to

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:03,430
have free shipping and then I was so

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,610
persistent to find the same one and the

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,540
same one is 135 with free shipping from

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,279
China and if I buy it in Serbia it would

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,949
be 15.6

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,610
that is another really really bad thing

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:22,009
about e-commerce these days so when you

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,220
see all of this you're like why would

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:29,959
they buy anything online and it's a big

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,809
lie that ecommerce is rising and that is

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,430
growing rapidly it is growing rapidly

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:41,300
but only for known brands for big brands

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:43,399
smaller brands can succeed in really

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,230
really really small percentage only if

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:50,870
you're really unique and if you'll

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:52,579
really put some effort into it but why

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,350
people then are buying online despite

00:13:52,579 --> 00:14:00,290
everything first of all you can check

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,110
product reviews but we need to say that

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,149
product reviews all are also fake

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,629
because people are mostly buying product

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,879
reviews and not only on their web shops

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,660
they are also buying product reviews for

00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,480
TripAdvisor

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,910
for everywhere where we go people are

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,790
trying to scam you somehow and then you

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,430
visit some place that you saw some great

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,579
reviews and you actually see that the

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,889
most of them were fake and paid because

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:31,300
probably the most of those people who

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:36,589
laughter if you never visited that place

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:41,029
but in that sea of reviews you might

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:44,779
find some that are actually real it

00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:47,839
saves our time because you can buy

00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:50,720
something while you're here if my talk

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,259
is boring to you you can serve something

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,720
and buy something online you can compare

00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,699
prices in different shops this is a

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,639
special important for bigger brands so

00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:04,699
if you're buying something known like

00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,279
let's say LG TV you can see in many

00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:11,779
different shops the price compare prices

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,839
and find the list price and something

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,939
that is closest to you to buy it wider

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,929
selection there is one rating in Greece

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:23,329
it's called screwed gr it's a website

00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:25,600
where you connect your shop to you are

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,890
paying like 500 or 600 euros

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,190
they are taking care that you are real

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,780
that you're not fake and Greeks are not

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,480
using Google when they want to buy

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,720
something they are using screws because

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,140
in screws you have if you type in like

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,080
night night laser you will have compared

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:49,640
prices for a night night laser in all

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:53,170
shops connected to screwed also you can

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,680
see if the number is available color or

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,020
whatever you need

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,000
so screws is pretty much interesting in

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,650
Greece and I believe that it will spread

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,060
all around Europe something like that

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:07,040
because it gives more trust to people to

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,210
buy when they finally find something on

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,180
roads also in online shops very often

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,700
you have some discounted prices like

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,580
4050 percent if you buy online because

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,760
it's more expensive to have a real shop

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,920
and to pay like two three or four

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,080
thousand euros in the city centre for a

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,420
twenty square meter shop then to have

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,340
online shop and that is why they're

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,500
giving you huge discounts if you buy

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,660
online of course you have to subscribe

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,610
to a newsletter so they can pile you up

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,160
and spam you with their offers what is

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,030
the brighter ecommerce future in my

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,440
opinion no mobile apps

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:51,500
how many mobile apps per month you

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,390
installed on your phone after you buy a

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,310
phone installed like viber whatsapp

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,700
messenger your Facebook Instagram that

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:08,200
kind of stuff some navigation GPS

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:10,430
whatever and after that that much yep

00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:14,800
probably zero per month

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:17,270
I sometimes install some games and

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,209
delete those games when I'm bored

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,790
but that's it you're not installing

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,010
applications to your phone especially if

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,680
you want to buy shoes you will

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,870
definitely not install application for

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,930
some shoe shop because you're not buying

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,820
shoes every day your bank shows two or

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,040
three times in a year and that's it

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,550
maybe less so you don't want to have

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,580
application in your

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,290
just because you will buy shoes but if

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,830
you use progressive web applications

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,440
there are some because you're not

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,760
installing anything on your phone you

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,440
just put an icon and for web shop owners

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,620
it's better to have progressive web

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,260
applications because you're abusing the

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,780
clients phone and his resources and not

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,820
your server resources and also when you

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,800
update something in your progressive web

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,190
application it will be automatically

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,340
updated on your client side so you're

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:18,240
not dependent on the client and if he

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,380
updated application or not so it's

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,890
better to use progressive web

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,530
application and Lancome when they

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,300
rebuilt it their mobile their website

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,360
and they added progressive web

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,810
application conversions went up really

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,250
significantly it was like really really

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:41,310
for them they didn't they didn't expect

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,690
it at all to have that that growth on

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:48,240
their shop what else

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:51,390
bi-directional social and chat apps in

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,870
China it's normal they already have

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,350
options to bi-directional social so you

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,450
don't have to leave Facebook let's say

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,940
some their Facebook you don't have to

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,650
leave to buy you can buy there you're

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:10,140
not redirected to some shop you're

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:12,870
buying in social application also in

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,750
viber snapchat and other applications

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,490
you will have option to buy so you will

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:22,260
not have to leave Instagram to buy

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:26,010
something from some shop and that is

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:29,250
really good because because I believe

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:34,860
that then Instagram and others will

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:37,350
check if you're a fake or not they're

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,600
stealing our dye data so they should at

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:45,810
least do that for us what more in car

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,330
ecommons shopping on the go we are

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,730
racking our cars every day because we

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,929
are looking at our phones while we are

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,779
driving because we are

00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:57,629
those huge tablets that they're putting

00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,419
in every car these days and they're

00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:02,519
collecting information where we are

00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,590
going where we are traveling when we are

00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,049
traveling how much time we are spending

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:11,249
what is our speed so they know

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:15,869
everything about our everyday movement

00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:18,779
through the city so nearly 135 million

00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:21,299
Americans are using on the go shopping

00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,129
every day because they are getting push

00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,070
notifications when there is a gas

00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:30,389
station around or so and with the newer

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,549
cars when your gas is low it will

00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:35,009
probably send you a notification there

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:37,200
is a gas station one mile away from you

00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:39,269
so you can stop by there and add more

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,249
fuel because you're you're running out

00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,379
of fuel so that is one of the things

00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:48,210
that will be a future of e-commerce and

00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:50,730
we need to use that what else detailed

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,399
product information when you're buying

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:57,149
something you're not buying if you're

00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:59,999
not sure that it will fit you so if you

00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:02,690
see a t-shirt or shirt or jeans or

00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:06,110
whatever without detailed information of

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,789
its size you will not buy it

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,580
what you can do if you are Web shop

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,269
owner and it's really easy if you're

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:18,090
selling shoes

00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:22,080
I know that for editors I'm wearing like

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,559
40 foreign tutors and for Nike it's 45

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,960
health so there is a difference but you

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,090
know that there is a difference so you

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,070
can compare your shoes with Nike and

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:36,690
others and you can say if you are

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:39,059
wearing Nike 45 you should probably go

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,659
with 44 and a half with our shoes

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:45,269
because our shoes are bigger that way

00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,029
people will know what to buy otherwise

00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:50,580
when you see some shoes some brand that

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:53,490
is not that tall or maybe you never wear

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:57,480
some that brand maybe it's famous brand

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,179
but you're never wearing it before you

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,240
ten times easier for your customer to

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,700
find size by matching it with something

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,290
that is really really known and everyone

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:12,990
is very augmented-reality

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,120
it's so easy you have it on your iPhone

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,870
you have that measure application that

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,290
is measuring in centimeters if you want

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:25,799
to see how big something is and there is

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,720
one application diamond edge they built

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:32,549
an application where you can see how

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:36,540
ring looks on your finger and you can

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:38,970
check the size the size of the a diamond

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,400
you can check you can change the shape

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:45,660
of the ring and you can see how it looks

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,510
on your hand and both you will get the

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:55,200
size what is the size of the ring that

00:22:48,510 --> 00:23:02,790
you should order also gap it's famous

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:06,510
brand you add your height weight your

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:09,809
body type and then when you pick the

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:13,700
size small medium or large it actually

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:13,700
shows you how it will look on your body

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,059
it's easy as that

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:23,900
augmented reality is not something new

00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,900
it's not high-tech it's easy to build

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,669
this Raptor die

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:33,210
first of all diverse sales and support

00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:36,030
teams why because I would probably

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,429
rather buy something from from someone

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:42,990
who is similar to me and who has similar

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:44,610
interest like me but you can lie do you

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,120
really think when you contact support

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:52,820
from some big brand that some Michael

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,820
actually responded to you or some Eric

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,320
does it have to be the name of that

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:03,480
person who is chatting with you probably

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,909
not well in 99% it's not because the big

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,590
companies are mostly using cheap labor

00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:11,190
for support and those people are not

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,250
Michael area

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:18,270
and John those people are mostly from

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:21,000
China India some less developed

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:23,549
undeveloped countries like Serbia my

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,090
country or so and then you can see that

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,190
they're using names and you see when you

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,600
see that English that they are typing

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,679
that they are not native English

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,600
speakers but you can lie your customers

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,340
and they will feel better they will know

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,960
that you are lying but they will feel

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:46,650
better limiter artificial intelligence

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,630
and higher humans because people like to

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,909
talk to humans not to robots and

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:55,200
machines what I hate the most is

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:57,900
intercom when there is a chat and I

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,400
start typing in chat how to create a

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:04,230
backup and it offers me FAQ and

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:07,380
frequently asked questions to check

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,870
their if I wanted to read your article

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,590
about how to create a backup I would do

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,960
it earlier I would not contact your

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,720
support and I would never open that chat

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,289
box so I don't want to waste time and

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,570
read I don't know this big article just

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,289
tell me where to click and that's it but

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,600
they're pushing you in three or four

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,330
different steps before you can actually

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,220
chat with an agent and that is stressing

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,559
customers and probably the most of the

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:45,539
customers will just leave that chat and

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:48,539
leave your product why hiring humans

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:51,419
humans is good have you heard about

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,909
Zappos do you know what what's up sis is

00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:57,450
the big company from Europe and what

00:25:53,909 --> 00:26:00,780
they did one year their customer loyalty

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:06,450
team sends out nearly 13,000 written

00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:09,600
cards but they were written by hand not

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,650
printed and posted written by hand all

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,530
of their employees working in cities

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:19,070
where they have loyal customers

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:22,830
they took postcards and bring them on

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,290
the door ringin the bell and said hi I'm

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,760
from Zappos this is

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:32,929
our postcard we are want to say thank

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,750
you for being our loyal customer that is

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,390
that human relations and that is the

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,540
future of e-commerce and I think future

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:44,390
in general because people will start

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,470
getting sick of artificial intelligence

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,809
and that kind of stuff

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:52,549
communicating with robots because we are

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:55,730
not communicating with Robert use your

00:26:52,549 --> 00:27:01,309
customers as a salesperson word-of-mouth

00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,690
I again invented hot water people also

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,750
buy from people they trust and they

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:08,270
trust people they like so if you're

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,390
buying WordPress thing in example or a

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,570
plugin you will probably ask someone

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,010
from Slovakian WordPress community

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,950
because you trust those people they are

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,960
from the same group as you are they're

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,270
similar to you and of course if you will

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,340
trust them and if they give you an

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,770
advice you will probably go and buy

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:36,020
something that someone from Slovakian

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:37,640
WordPress community suggested so the

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:43,190
brighter ecommerce future is definitely

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:47,559
trust the trust is shaken because of all

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:50,750
these scams spamming stealing our data

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,130
you know what happened once you know

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:56,200
that they are recording actually your

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:59,770
voice messages in chat applications and

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,960
they're actually mark doing marketing

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:04,010
according to those voice messages me and

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,770
my girlfriend we are communicating

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:10,669
mostly I record voice messages and I'm

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:14,450
not typing and once I told her look can

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:18,910
you buy me the 200 grams pack of samba

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:21,950
coffee it's a coffee from her place and

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,860
bring it when you're coming and she was

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:28,580
like yeah okay I visited the instrument

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:32,659
tomorrow and there was an ad Samba

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,550
coffee so how I never ever know where

00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:38,800
typed Samba coffee

00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:42,070
the only place when I mentioned samba

00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,700
coffee anywhere is a voice message that

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,710
I sent to her over viber so if they say

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,300
they are not stealing I'm not listening

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,550
our messages they're lying because

00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:56,920
they're so we need to build more trust

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:59,560
somehow I don't know how I gave a couple

00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:07,830
of examples how you should figure out

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:11,140
the rest so you should trust me an

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,670
ecommerce future will be brighter thanks
