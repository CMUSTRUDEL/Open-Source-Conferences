thank you

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,709
my name is Yvonne and I'm a CEO of the

00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:15,429
company vibration and I'm here today for

00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:17,949
speaking about remote collaboration with

00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:23,500
the client or with your team so or in

00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:26,250
your team so let's get say something

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:31,240
about me I start the building website in

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:35,350
1999 so it is 20 years from now and it

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:40,090
was HTML and CSS 1 and we use tables so

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:46,899
if you know this wait how to do websites

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:49,539
you you know the joke like that because

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:55,890
you write every everything in tables and

00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:59,019
souls and rows so in that era is gone so

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,800
we start to build websites on PHP and

00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:04,720
then there are some there are some CMS

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,340
like WordPress and I found WordPress in

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:15,159
I think 20 2006 and in 2007 I built my

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,810
first blog which is working right now as

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,710
you can see these sprint screenings from

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,060
today

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,430
so it's update you need to update your

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,759
WordPress so you can have your WordPress

00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:31,390
for 10 years in and more so from 2007

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,770
I'm building website on WordPress and I

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:38,890
will tell you something about the

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:42,340
journey how I make website and which

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:47,560
tools I used i start with cauldre 8 I

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:51,399
think maybe 7 in 2000 I think and then I

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,899
found when Joe Pro then I start with

00:01:51,399 --> 00:02:00,280
Photoshop and I really enjoyed the

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:04,149
Photoshop and I stay with Photoshop

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,659
maybe for 10 years and maybe 10 up ten

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:10,300
thousand hours of designing so

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,390
Photoshop is my best tool for designing

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,770
and the time and then I started building

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:21,819
flash animations and flesh applications

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:26,410
I use ActionScript one then I think five

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:30,060
years ago with start building website

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,890
and designing things in sketching and I

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,770
thought that is the best thing for

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:40,840
building websites and designing things

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,790
and design custom templates so vibration

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,890
is digital agency focused on WordPress

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,260
and we are basing that lava but a lot of

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,050
our team members are not embarrassed of

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,400
us over a remote company and we use

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,920
modern tools so here today I want to

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,519
tell you something about the modern told

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,580
me which we use and I pick two of them

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:07,989
we try to make a website with the

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,840
WordPress but also we have our own our

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,209
own platform for e-commerce so in

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,489
WordPress we use right now Guttenberg

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,310
and we really enjoy WordPress API and

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,820
right now we are focused on vue.js so

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,310
front-end will be in vue.js

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,239
in future website and future templates

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:31,900
we also every time we make custom

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,489
template and custom plugins so our

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,989
clients are happy because it's really

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:40,120
fast and why I'm here today I want to

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,850
tell you something about how to optimize

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,590
your work how to speak with your client

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,190
and team members and how to get feedback

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,250
from the client and we want to be really

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,350
productive so if you are designer web

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,750
design a front-end programmer project

00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,910
manager or product owner or client you

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:05,079
are in the right place so I I pick two

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:07,359
of them - two - software's or maybe

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,210
software services there are online

00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:14,970
programs or services

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:18,820
and first of first of it is asana and

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,820
authorized content it's a collaborative

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,090
tool for project management but we use

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,220
it for different things like to make

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,030
specification with the client we also

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,370
make estimates inside of the astara also

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,770
we use rave several templates to to

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:42,040
define the the whole process of the

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:47,350
project and every time we use project

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:50,620
management project manage this asana for

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,380
me the project management tool one of

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,780
the best of the all of the tools you can

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,470
use Monday you can use Basecamp you can

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,380
use Trello

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,080
it's a little bit same but I think that

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,080
authorized the best and faster for the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,790
also for the big projects also we use it

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,870
for communication so we we tend to use

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:18,670
emails and we try to to speak with the

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:23,080
clients with the with just asana so you

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:35,590
don't miss your emails or some some

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:38,760
communication so we also we try to have

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,520
everything about the project in asana so

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,680
all of the ideas change requests

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:51,310
function function requirements

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:54,280
backtracking so when when you go to the

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,470
project in asana you see everything

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,380
about the project and all whole

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:04,000
communication in the in the project we

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:07,570
also put em put client to the workspace

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,820
or project so you can speak with the

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,700
with the client inside asana and also he

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,150
can speak with the with the programmers

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,940
and designers and you don't need to send

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,860
emails or calls and things like this

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,929
so I I can

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,489
show you the default process of us of

00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:30,509
our company

00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:32,669
it's like sales phase then it's

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,779
milestone of a preparation of the

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:40,319
project I I think that you can't see

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:43,139
this but you can you can put your task

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,439
into the milestone so this looks like

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,049
waterfall and it is water for I think

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,229
but you can see whole phases in the

00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:56,039
project and the whole task in the phases

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:58,829
so you can you don't you don't need to

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,619
think about the next step or next phase

00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:04,259
in the project and you go one by one and

00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:07,529
you just check everything

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:13,579
also asana is good for support because

00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:18,379
the clients send you requests or bugs or

00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:21,569
some requirements to do a project and in

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,479
here we use a different approach in this

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:28,469
project we have ideas to do doing and

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:32,069
review and done so you can go from

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:34,229
different phases or milestones but we

00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:39,539
use it like interval so you can go with

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:42,360
the task to different step in the

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,239
project also we use it for feedback and

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,909
communication so client comment

00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:51,329
everything and you can ask client to

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:55,259
give your feedback and give you feedback

00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:59,999
and we use it like send a print screen

00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:06,769
or upload upload your like folders or

00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:09,269
files next next software is figma and

00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:12,479
most of this presentation will be about

00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:17,399
the figma it in one sentence Google Docs

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:21,899
for designers so if you can imagine you

00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:24,360
are working on the program it's online

00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,610
and you can you can see how your

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,610
designer clicking and what he is doing

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,880
and you can put how many designers we

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,790
want into one artboard or one one place

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
so

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:42,480
it's really easy in really fast so let's

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:47,230
go into the figma so why framing is the

00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,750
process of making some sketch and to to

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,620
prototype the website and then we can

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:57,490
make clickable prototypes and then we

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,470
make designs and and interaction sayings

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,270
and then you can use for testing

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,010
feedback version control from that

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:09,510
programming so by Framing we used paper

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,850
it's the best way right now also and

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,920
then we switch to acts

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,580
RP then we use buzzer make then power

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,360
point some clients send it in Excel also

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,700
good good thing is Google drawings but

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,980
in figma it's really easy and really

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,620
fast and it's online all the time so

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,900
it's final version all the time and as

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,070
you can see this is start of the project

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:40,810
so here in this area I start with the

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,550
sketching and then if we go closer you

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,090
can see this will be Red Cross website

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:51,670
building of built on web that's sorry

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:54,790
built in WordPress and here is my frame

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,980
of the front page and maybe some sub

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,910
pages sometimes you can go from the

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,090
difference back perspective and you

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:09,400
don't need to go totally into the

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:12,820
components but you just write or draw

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,710
just the rectangles and you can speak

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,660
with on skype with your with your

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,670
designer or with the with the client and

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:23,260
you can sketch online and you can see

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:27,730
the the mouth so it's really easy to be

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:31,470
remote and remotely speak about may be

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:36,670
different or next feed feature

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:40,300
requirements and also design also we use

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:43,900
asana for making prototypes so the old

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,470
way we used a sharpie or Photoshop or

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,430
sketch and then

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,970
we export all the design things into the

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,880
envisioned and envisioned we made areas

00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:02,240
which clickable and you can you can make

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:05,240
links to that to that areas so right now

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:19,010
I try I try I'll try the second

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:22,370
microphone okay so it works so when when

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,910
we speak about divine framing I'm just

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,310
click a it's really good to know the

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,420
keyboard shortcuts because you will be

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:36,140
faster than if you use paper so I just

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,590
click R so I can make a rectangle then

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,610
you can copy it and make like a normal

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:46,460
form then okay I want to have call to

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,280
action button so I put some colors

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:56,930
inside of it so right now I have the

00:11:49,280 --> 00:12:02,500
form you can make groups so it's really

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:07,400
easy to sketch everything then you can

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:12,140
you can see here all the artboards are

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:15,560
inside of the one place let's look

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:19,550
inside these so this is sketch of the of

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:24,550
the pages sometimes you can go deeper

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:28,750
and it looks like this sometimes it's

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,940
ready for the designing here's some

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:39,550
maybe interaction sayings and how how it

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:43,100
will works and sometimes it's really up

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,620
like here so this is the form or this is

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,070
FAQ so I know that there will be text

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,710
but there is no text right now so there

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,940
is just preparation of the project then

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,720
you can make prototypes like this so you

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,480
can see all the

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,880
these aren't for the website this is

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,130
professor days which is also based in

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,200
WordPress and this will be read easily I

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:12,810
think in the future so you can send PNG

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,460
or PDF files but it's better to see

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,850
prototype like this working so it's

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:24,570
clickable and it looks like the complete

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:27,150
application so the clients can see how

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,940
it works okay it is forum you can

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:34,410
register there is a clear code then you

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:38,030
can make some changes you can go back

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:42,600
and what is really good inside of these

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:47,460
you you can send it to your client or to

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,970
the clients customers and he can he can

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:55,050
then realize how it works if it is fast

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,980
if it is reasonable and how how it works

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:02,010
and how it works

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:03,870
so if he if the clients can't if he if

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,440
the client want to make some changes he

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,170
just click see and he want to make this

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:17,970
bigger so he just write your comment

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:20,850
write your comment so heading so

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,190
designer get feedback from the client

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,240
from the prototype but when you switch

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:30,990
to the to the figma you can see it here

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,850
so there is a if I click see I can see

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,090
comments and I see this one and I can

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:40,290
resolve it so I just go here and change

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:42,930
the text size there is a style so I can

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,300
change it here and make it bigger but

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,180
there is no space so I'll leave it here

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:57,330
like this and I can resolve the comments

00:14:48,180 --> 00:15:00,180
so I said yes it's okay okay and here so

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:04,080
you can cooperate with the more people

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:09,900
inside one one artboard or one one

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,310
project then if you go inside of

00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,120
designing things

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,339
I need to wait here okay okay see here's

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,249
a different project and you can see

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,589
there is also design so it goes from

00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:27,089
maybe something like this like

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:29,220
preparation some very framing and in one

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:31,769
project you can have everything and

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,629
there is a design so you can go inside

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:40,529
this and your programmer can check the

00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:45,480
code from the Sigma so we don't believe

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:50,939
this this software so it's really easy

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:54,420
so here is it is you can find all of the

00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:56,790
all of the serious things for for the

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,569
programmer so you can see found family

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:03,809
fun style and everything he can measure

00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:08,129
how far some things are so if you build

00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:12,899
your custom template you definitely try

00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:16,829
you want to be quick and don't use

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:23,879
different software's for things to cut

00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:25,529
the design okay so so it's like sketch

00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:32,459
buddy's online so it's better than

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:37,079
schedule okay next project is like this

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:43,050
you can see that it's really fast it's

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:44,809
online and they use cloud to to optimize

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:52,319
the speed so you don't need to have a

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:55,259
fast computer or fast graphic driver or

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:58,259
graphic card so it's really fast and you

00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:02,339
can have multiple multiple pages and

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,260
multiple screens inside one project you

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:08,120
can also make it you can also make

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,110
design system inside as as figma and

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,360
let's see if it works

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:19,380
I here is our our project so from the

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,000
May of this year we done plenty of

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,069
designs so I'll try this one

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,709
if it works

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,830
as you can see we use it for comments

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:34,730
but I want to show you that after final

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,730
final design contain a lot of comments

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,780
here I can switch to shore ease of

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,900
comments and these small panes blue

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,679
panes and white pins are comments so in

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,130
one page

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:53,900
we cooperate with the designer and make

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:57,419
lot of changes so if I click see you can

00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,000
you can see how many times we change

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,730
things inside the design but we don't

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,240
need to send all of all the files and

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,860
all the print screens by email or make

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,320
some exports in envision it's also

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:18,030
clickable so I can click here just play

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,040
the prototype and every time is when the

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,840
client want to see the final design he

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:31,169
just opened the file you can share also

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:33,690
this this edit view so I can send just

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:37,440
link and I can say okay this our team

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,320
and I can send him just to view the

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,559
things to not to change and I can send

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:48,150
him email about ok give me your feedback

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:51,090
and maybe Martine want to cut the design

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,130
and make some changes so I've made the

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,809
rights for the editing of the document

00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:01,020
and programmers are really like it

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,710
because you can use it on Linux Mac or

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,160
Windows

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,630
so it's multi-platform so it's the game

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,559
changer for us because we don't need to

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:14,130
have a lot of schedule I senses we eat

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:20,190
just for free it's where you how to do

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:24,090
it we don't need to use all I think it's

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:27,960
also change of our work because we we

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:31,830
more we are more productive and we more

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,169
we cooperate in daily basis and we

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,220
comment everything and maybe more people

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:40,510
are involved into the project so it

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:43,270
so really really better and our designs

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:47,620
are I think are better and the client is

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:53,610
in in in the project from the from the

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,610
beginning so he can see whole I think

00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:02,610
whole process and how the things are

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:06,370
built and it's easy to explain them

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:11,350
clients to the clients that how work it

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:16,780
how long it takes and how what is what

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:18,970
is below it and they like it and they

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:24,419
are they really like commenting the

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:30,460
designs so like this so maybe I can

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:33,549
finalize my live demo with this this

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:38,380
slide the last slide main reasons why to

00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:43,600
use asana and sigma is because they are

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:47,470
online so there are really really game

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:52,570
changers in the field of web design and

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:54,909
communication figma is really really

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,110
best tool in this year i which i found

00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:03,190
so i really recommend it to everyone but

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:05,710
let's let's say okay why to switch from

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,490
sketch or why to switch from Photoshop

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,909
or Adobe XD because it's online so it's

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,470
the most valuable thing with what I

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,169
think and

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:22,450
it's multifunctional so you can use it

00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:24,840
for everything in in case of from start

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,460
of the project to end of the project

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:31,480
then it's easy to learn if you know

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:35,830
sketch or or Adobe XD it's really easy

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,980
to learn there is some some shortcuts

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:43,210
keyboard shortcuts I will recommend you

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,280
to learn that and it's free so if you

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,580
have one project or if you leave it in

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,890
one project it's free and it's free for

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,880
all of your use

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:56,460
inside of the project so I think that

00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,840
you can you can put all of your company

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,370
inside of the project also you can save

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,700
money because you don't need to have

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:08,640
using Photoshop schedule a extra or in

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,260
vision and it's online it's fast and

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,230
it's multi-platform you can also

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,630
download the application so you can have

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,600
it like you can see I have the

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,220
application but you can work also in

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,130
Chrome or in Firefox

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,730
so it's online so that's it so what to

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,070
do next

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,070
try a sauna if you don't if you travel

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,870
you can live in Traill but try a sauna

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:41,580
and if you are designer or you want to

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:44,280
sketch some things try figma and maybe

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,490
try to learn about design systems it can

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,950
be really faster when you use your

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:52,740
libraries in the project and traffic my

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,740
plugins there's they are here for maybe

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,710
two months and I think that there will

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,100
be future of development that you will

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,679
make like you can see website in figma

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,400
but it is online I think if you can

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:11,669
imagine that we just say that ok let's

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,580
try to show this one I can zoom it here

00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:17,760
and I want to I want to change this

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,679
heading from the database I think that

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,380
the front end the front and programmers

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,960
they will not have a lot of work because

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,710
it's it's working like this so I think

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,429
it's future so I will see it in maybe 2

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,620
years that some guys smart guys make

00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:37,799
some plugins and you will export figma

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:43,710
things into the website so this is the

00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:45,120
future so thank you very much and if you

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,049
have some questions I will be here for

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,970
all day and also on after-party so you

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,540
can ask me about the figma Rosanna I

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,540
will help you

00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,609
