okay thanks for coming to listen to me

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:15,309
I'll try not to do the butterfly with my

00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:16,299
hands the content of my talk is going to

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,650
be Who I am

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,070
it's going to talk about some early

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,740
games some games in school

I'm a libertarian some 90s games some

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,460
family games some online multiplayer

00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,649
games current games that's the game part

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,539
there's also going to be blogs and media

00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:46,809
so the end of history of since Francis

00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:50,109
Fukuyama I wrote the book in 1992 at the

00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:52,019
end of the Berlin Wall

00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:54,879
which is partly why I'm here also

00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:57,070
blogger how I've written some blogs and

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,949
bloggers using the Wayback Machine to

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,960
get my dead mow time blog back a little

00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,960
bit the fall of the Berlin Wall I

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,220
mentioned some of my favorite bloggers

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,350
neo neo Con and asked blog of Arnold

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:16,750
Kling other book marks I make a little

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:21,430
bit of Facebook where Iowa hopefully

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,380
love-hate relationship some Twitter and

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,229
Trump where I have a love and a

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,810
disagreement relationship a tiny bit of

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:33,820
WordPress at the very end who I am I'm

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,729
an American I'm a libertarian that's

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,159
mostly free-market and freedom oriented

00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,899
freedom with responsibility you know

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,299
there's two kinds of freedom there's

00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:45,969
adult freedom and child freedom the

00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,130
child freedom is freedom from

00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,860
responsibility so that if they make a

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:54,479
mistake someone else pays for it

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,920
adult freedom is the freedom to act but

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,710
along with the freedom to act goes the

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,960
freedom of all the responsibility to pay

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,539
for the consequences and what almost

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,649
everybody wants is that adult freedom to

00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:09,760
act with the childish freedom of

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,940
responsibility so if there's a mistake

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,920
they want someone else to pay for it

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,510
I've been working in IT I'm a

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,000
finance expert a game player and

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,970
technologically very savvy but I'm

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,860
getting tired of learning new updates

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,980
all the time every six months every

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:45,819
three months language after language how

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:49,540
did I get to Slovak five minutes or so

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,250
show five minutes or so per slide well

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,680
I've got over 100 slides that's going to

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,350
be 500 minutes no I have to start

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,510
speeding up and it's about 10 seconds of

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:03,790
slide once I start moving a little bit

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,590
of economics transition I came to

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:13,000
Slovakia with my own everex 386 a laptop

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,590
notebook 6 kilo machine it was kind of

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,709
unique at the time but I don't have a

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:20,500
picture of it anymore so I'm gonna start

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,970
with card games I'm gonna talk a little

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,209
bit about rummy solitaire but no

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,700
pinochle spades hearts and poker rummy

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,570
is very much like the Slovak game Joliet

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,769
and I played Juliet with Jokers and it's

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,870
the basic game you tried to create a

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,840
trick and you play it and you score the

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,010
most points and wins solitaire most of

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,260
you have played it it's also available

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,150
on our computer my mother loved this

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,459
game and she would play it every night

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,320
in fact the night before she died she

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,140
was at home she was playing solitaire

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:57,970
she went to bed and she didn't wake up

00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,609
that was Oh 14 years ago I went to

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,540
America for her funeral it was sad but

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:06,730
it was also nice to see my family

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,269
pinochle is a very strange game pinochle

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,930
refers to a queen of spades and a Jack

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,010
of Diamonds

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:19,180
that's a pinochle it's played with the

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:24,220
high cards and the suit goes in order a

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,349
s-- and king queen jack so it's a

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,000
strange game but I liked it and I played

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,009
a lot of it when I was in junior high

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,099
school

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:36,069
spades I still play spades and spades

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:39,459
has the advantage of you have to choose

00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:42,580
how many tricks you're going to win and

00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:45,069
then you play tricks to get those and

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:50,649
spades is always Trump so you can see

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:53,499
here South is bidding to and it's got

00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,259
three Trump's king queen Jack and it's

00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:57,909
got this king of of clubs it doesn't

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,129
know if the king of clubs is going to be

00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:03,149
a winner I probably won't because the

00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:05,439
ace of clubs will be higher than it or

00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:08,229
it might be trumped by someone who

00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,479
doesn't have any clubs so he's got two

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:14,189
definite winners between king queen and

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:18,610
Jack and you could even get three spades

00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:21,279
punishes you - ten points times the

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,800
number you bid if you miss it but if you

00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,709
get over so if he does get three tricks

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,589
he'll get 21 points and you usually pay

00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:31,419
play up to 200 or so my daughter likes

00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,740
spades my wife doesn't like it so much

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,149
she doesn't like card games

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,589
I like card games I like hearts hearts

00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:42,639
is a very different kind of card game

00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:46,509
the idea is to not get points and the

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,860
way to avoid getting points is to avoid

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:53,319
suits high cards of suits and it has the

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,050
advantage and disadvantage of tray of

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,029
trading you trade three cards you pass

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,069
three cards to lift then pass three

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,930
cards to the right and pass across and

00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,719
then you keep according to the rounds of

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,539
hands it also has a strange scoring

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,579
system where every heart that you get on

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:13,089
your tricks is one point which is

00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:16,509
negative and the Queen of Spades is 13

00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:19,119
points so it's very negative and there's

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,909
also another interesting thing if you

00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:24,909
get all 13 hearts plus the Queen of

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:27,669
Spades you get 26 points except that you

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,649
don't get that everybody else gets it so

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:33,099
this is called going for it all or

00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:34,629
shooting the moon and that's what makes

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,189
Hearts really really interesting because

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,110
most of the time you're trying to avoid

00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,550
so everyone else is thinking oh they're

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,499
doing great they're getting no hearts

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,350
but you're taking them all so you take

00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,800
them all

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,890
then they all get 26 it's great fun then

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,780
there's poker here's a list of poker

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,000
rankings if you don't know straight

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,520
flush four of a kind Full House flush

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,390
straight three of a kind two pair one

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,190
pair and I card and the pots get big

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,100
when two people think that they're both

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,480
going to win or when one person is

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,460
bluffing and the other person thinks

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,750
he's going to win or when first is

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,580
bluffing and the other person thinks

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,840
he's bluffing but isn't sure who's gonna

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,940
win chess board games I played lots of

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,130
board games when I was young I liked

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,930
chess one of the interesting things as

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm looking for these images on the

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,850
Internet is that many of them are

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,940
advertising images if you look at this

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,300
board game beautiful stunts and pieces

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,220
by the way it has black in front it's

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,750
sort of closer to you and white on the

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,760
other side most of them are the other

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,510
way if you try to look at the pieces

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,390
you'll see this is strange Black has

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,390
made four moves and white has only made

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,070
three moves because why it is supposed

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:54,160
to go first so this was not really a

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:58,400
game this is just advertising monopoly

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,380
is another great game that I like and I

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,060
used to know all the rents and all the

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,700
properties and you know how you start

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,000
out with the money you know five ones

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,460
five five five ten six 20s to 50s to

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,090
hundreds and to five hundredths that's

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:17,360
1500 bucks and if you land with a four

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:21,290
in income tax you pay the ten percent

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,480
which is 150 instead of the 200 but as

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,750
you start getting more money it's 200

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,000
more often my wife doesn't like monopoly

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,040
either that well because my daughter

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,690
when we were playing it if she my

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,610
daughter would get upset she would give

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,160
all our money and all our property to

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,200
somebody else and that would very much

00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,570
disturb the game

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,060
another two-person game that I like is

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,310
Stratego and again this is just for

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,700
advertising purposes no one is going to

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,070
put their flag out here near the front

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,870
so that it can be easily taken because

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,280
when your flag is taken by the other

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,710
team you lose

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,750
almost always you want your flag in the

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:04,610
back either disguised or protected by

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,560
bombs now they do have this guy

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,420
protected by a few bumps but you don't

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,420
put the bombs in front you put the bombs

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,420
in back but Strategos a fun game a

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:20,330
really fun game is risk now when I was

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,010
growing up I had a box very much like

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:28,520
this kind of funky and if you look at

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,430
this these are little wooden squares and

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,820
there used to be also little wooden

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,910
oblong pieces for 1000 of these is one

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,130
army the newer risks like my the one of

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,310
my sister has and when I was visiting my

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,410
sister this year she won a risk game and

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,740
she was really happy they take about

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,290
four or five hours it's not so quick and

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,210
she has kind of cool little pieces that

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,460
looked like armies or cannons or cavalry

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,770
and you have three dice if you're

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,230
attacking and two dice if you're

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,700
defending or or less it might be if you

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,040
only have one guy left

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,010
you only get one die so it's a very

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,870
interesting lots of die rolling your

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,820
three dice against the other guys two

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,500
dice if you're attacking and it's your

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,830
highest dice against their highest die

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,410
and so if you have a six and A one and A

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,240
one and they have a five and a two your

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,730
six beats their five but their two beats

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,790
your one so you lose one and they lose

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,130
one so you're attacking you have lots of

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,300
stuff and you slowly take over the world

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:38,750
it's all a lot of fun another game that

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,550
I used to play quite a bit is 3d

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,339
tic-tac-toe I don't know how well you

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:48,830
can see it but in this case there were

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:52,220
four levels of clear plastic and each

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:57,680
level had a four by four so it was 16

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,720
squares so it was 48 possibilities and

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,860
you tried to get four in a row

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,650
up down across or on sort of a a

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,430
tic-tac-toe but four four and that was

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,710
very fun

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,040
a similar game is score for and you can

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,710
see right away again this is the stupid

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,270
advertising they don't even have some of

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,890
the posts so supposed to alternate but

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,960
the thing about score four there's two

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,420
ways of playing that that we used to

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,550
play one is the first one that gets four

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,330
in a row wins but you can see here the

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:36,360
ice white has four in a row here so

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,970
should win but you can also see black

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,520
has three in a row and only needs one

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,900
more on top but also over there has

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,460
three in a row and only needs one more

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:50,820
on top so it looks kind of nice I'm sure

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,290
somebody in marketing was looking at it

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,050
and say this is a nice looking image

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,910
there's I think there's sixteen black

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,110
and only twelve white so it was also

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:03,240
nice but it's nicely balanced anyway

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,570
score for another game if you like

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,590
graphs and things is go now go as a 19

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:13,170
by 19 grid and there was talk about how

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,670
go is harder for computers to play than

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:21,540
chess and that was true up until the

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,430
massive ability of throwing first more

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,560
hardware at the problem and second

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,660
smarter software so they have better

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,710
artificial intelligence looking at

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,730
patterns also when you play go the way I

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:42,780
was taught you can see very nicely here

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:44,430
the little black and white pieces you're

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,590
supposed to pick them up with your two

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,450
fingers like this and put them on the

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,150
board but I think most people don't do

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,890
that and you also are supposed to use

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:57,720
chopsticks when you're eating because

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:59,490
it's a Japanese game battleship how you

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,200
can buy battleship and play battleship

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,810
but I would always play almost always

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,230
play battleship just on graph paper you

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:11,790
make graph paper you play battleship you

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,690
put different sized ships five for an

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,830
aircraft carrier

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,990
four for four battleship three for a

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,850
cruiser three for a submarine two for

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,870
destroyer you put them on the grid

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,089
somewhere and

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:30,120
you guess where the other guy has his

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:34,380
and he sinks your battleship dots dots

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,960
can start out as just a four by four

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,480
dots or usually on graph paper five by

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,220
five ten by ten and you make the lines

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,320
and then the other guy makes the lines

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,230
and you keep making a line until you

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,970
start making boxes and then you count up

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,260
the boxes and number of boxes you get

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,870
wins in this game that you which was me

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,430
I'm about to lose because I made a box

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,900
here I'll make another box there and

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,320
then I have to put a line and as soon as

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:08,400
I put a line here or there or anywhere

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,040
he'll get all the other boxes I hadn't

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,870
played this before on the computer so it

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,700
was the first time I saw this as I'm

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,380
looking for this because this was

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,290
something I used to play when I was in

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,830
elementary school and that's fun another

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:26,700
fun graphical game is five in a row and

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,610
you as you could guess you try to get

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,650
five in a row like tic-tac-toe to get

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,720
five in a row typically you need two

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,900
cases of four in a row without being

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,370
blocked so that you're trying to get

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,410
lots of threes in a row that will

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,290
intersect so that you can get some twos

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,150
in or two times four in a row you can

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,140
see here you can also play it on a go

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,520
board which is kind of fun and nobody is

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,690
winning here this is actually looking

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,690
like it could have been a real game

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,760
pinball you know this is a walk through

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,360
my childhood and I used to love pinball

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I used to go to bowling alleys to play

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
pinball also when I was going to bowling

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,070
alleys they didn't have automatic scores

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,290
so if you were playing a bowling you had

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,150
to score it yourself if there were

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,370
leagues and there were lots of bowling

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,589
leagues they had to score themselves now

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,970
most people who Bowl when they're at

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:22,950
bullying and League one of the nice

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,770
things about bowling is you can be a

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,250
little bit tipsy and still Bowl in fact

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:32,880
you can be barely walking and still Bowl

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,820
but but you can't keep score and you're

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,280
barely walking so I would keep score

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,050
these guys and because I knew how to

00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,550
keep score and it's a little bit

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,680
complicated bowling you know if you get

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:47,730
a spare it's ten plus what you get on

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,680
the next roll if you get a strike it's

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,320
ten plus what you get on the next two

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,570
and if that's a straw another strike

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,100
then it's 20 plus the next one but if

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,950
it's a spare then it's twenty directly

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,300
plus you have to add each one so you

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,890
know you get eight in the first frame

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,450
and then you get a spare in the second

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,240
frame and then a third frame you get

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,630
another eight so but you got it by eight

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,480
in one ball so that's a twelve eighteen

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,280
plus eight is 26 and then another aide

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,500
is thirty four so you got to keep that

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,110
score that was in the bowling alley

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:23,100
pinball was much more easy and fun you

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,080
put the quarter in in the slot over here

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,630
and you have the flippers and you bound

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,490
it and you tilt and you really get upset

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:35,340
then finally moving towards arcade games

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:40,020
the first one was computer space and

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:42,390
this was a I this is what the arcade

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,900
machine looked like and there was a

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,520
little guy I had visions of having

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,890
little animations here but the

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,520
animations take too long so you're not

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,930
going to get animations I'm sorry but

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,560
one of the things about computer space

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,120
is you don't have the Thai fighter

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,780
moving quickly in the air because in

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,420
space nothing stops your momentum except

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,880
your own thrust so you have to turn

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,130
thrust against the way you're moving and

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,310
slow down and then start going another

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,439
way or you can turn but your momentum is

00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,199
really a big thing and these early games

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:23,370
were very interested in getting the

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:27,240
mathematics right so that was most of my

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:29,850
high school junior high some important

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,430
books Lord of the Rings a beautiful

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,580
wonderful fantasy I read it a few times

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,970
it led to Dungeons and Dragons and

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,410
adventure games moon is a harsh mistress

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,360
libertarian politics another way of

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,970
getting the libertarian politics is ala

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,890
shrugged and Hein Rand but and I would

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,540
read those too but that's not how I got

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:52,440
to libertarianism

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:56,070
Ender's Game was a fun book a but also

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,420
had a very small interesting side story

00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,990
where Enders

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,000
older brother and older sister were

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,650
having conversations on the world wide

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,320
net and this is before there was the

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:11,760
internet and they were shaping public

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,580
opinion I read lots of science fiction

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,710
and fantasy here in Slovakia you find

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,710
out very little science fiction inched

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,570
in Slovak it's in check and I don't and

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,790
a pretty actually overly in post

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,660
Levinsky those dobre nay over in

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,550
portuguese i Chesky any Isaac lots of

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:35,310
Slovaks don't know that because they

00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:38,610
grow up listening to check on their TV

00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:41,940
programs and reading check books in in

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,650
classes check people know that because

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,110
they don't look listen to Slovak stuff

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,820
and so lots of Czech adults have

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:53,100
difficulty understanding Slovak and

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:56,310
Harry Potter I read all 14 Harry Potter

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,050
books and only seven were written how

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,540
did I do that well I read them in

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:04,320
English and I read them in Slovak but it

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:08,940
helped my Slovak now I'm getting into

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,790
college and finally some games one of

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,850
the games was Star Trek now the games in

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:21,090
Star Trek and college were actually I

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:24,450
say it's here but they were actually

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:27,750
written on paper like this which I find

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:31,020
up in the back and the paper came out

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,770
printed like this where it would say

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,610
here is the Starship Enterprise here are

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,550
Klingons

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,440
you have some shields you can put up you

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,670
have photons you can use against the

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,130
Klingons and you tried to kill them and

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,940
you say what's happening and you get a

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:55,920
command and there's a list of commands

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:58,200
but it was typed out on paper in fact it

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,550
was typed out on a machine kind of like

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,550
this which was really fine

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:09,870
but it was kind of fun we get them up

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,870
and we type on the keyboard

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:20,230
not only Star Trek but also lunar lander

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:23,289
this was a old form lunar lander where

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,600
you have the feet your speed and fuel

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,519
and you're supposed to be giving the

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,799
fuel to slow yourself down you can see

00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,630
he's not doing it he's not using up any

00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,330
fuel and he's not slowing down in fact

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,889
he's getting faster so he touches down

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,779
but he doesn't quite touch down he

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:42,940
crashes he blew it appropriate

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,580
condolences will be sent to your next of

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,360
kin

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,279
later on lunar lander allowed you to

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:56,080
control on a screen with vector graphics

00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:58,269
and that was also quite fun adventure

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,200
was a game I spent a good amount of time

00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:06,809
in one Christmas when I was at Stanford

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,820
welcome to Adventure you're standing at

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:12,549
the end of a road before a small brick

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,440
building around you is a forest a small

00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,980
stream flows out of the building in

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,649
Donegal II so this is the beginning of

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,470
adventure in your mind you type go south

00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:24,700
go north or just north or south and you

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,179
go somewhere and you find some other

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,260
description and you find a great you get

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:36,159
into colossal cave which was actually

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:39,220
based on a real cave by this guy will

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:46,120
brother but most of the adventure games

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:49,990
in the u.s. colleges were revised by

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,539
Crothers of first pass by a guy named

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:56,169
don woods who I met and we'll get to

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:58,960
later oh and we're here on these are

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:02,919
text games so there's not really

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,700
graphics on the mainframes you could

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,159
also play Monopoly this is kind of hard

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,490
to see there's monopoly but because it's

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,680
a text game it's basic attempts at

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,280
graphics of the different properties

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,310
you can quickly play it this is not a

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,200
text game and you'll find out that a lot

00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,490
of my games are not text games or

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,570
computer games

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,970
this is diplomacy and it's a no luck

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,250
game everything that happens in

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,230
diplomacy happens because people order

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,850
it or they don't order it or they miss

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:43,540
order it or they forget to order it so

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:46,820
if your have a piece in Vienna and

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:50,840
Russia and your Austria and Russia has a

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,030
piece in Warsaw and you order your piece

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,030
to kaliesha and he orders his piece to

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,890
Galatia they bounce so then nothing

00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,330
happens so what do you have to do well

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,460
you have to take your piece that's in

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,920
Budapest and support your piece in

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,710
Vienna going to kaliesha so that you get

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,120
two against one and then you move but of

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,540
course if he thinks that you're doing

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,020
that maybe he's gonna go somewhere else

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,780
maybe come down here uh and so it's a

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,200
very interesting simple game the

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:24,200
mechanics are simple but what it is is

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,710
you as Austria talking to Germany about

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,150
how you two should go against Russia but

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,980
then you talk with Russia and you say

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,960
you and Russia should go against Germany

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,270
or maybe you and Russia should go

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,520
against Turkey or maybe you talk with

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,770
Turkey and say the two of us should go

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,250
against Italy and then there's Italy and

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:46,610
France and England it's a it's a fun

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,010
game take over Europe but no luck

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,140
involved you have to get them to order

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,080
its turn-based everyone writes orders

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:59,000
same time the written orders are read

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,530
and the results are shown very often

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,310
that's one of the results that you feel

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:06,620
you get stabbed in the back that was a

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:10,970
lot of fun I've never met a woman who

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,770
really likes playing this much and when

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,320
I was going to war game conventions in

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:20,330
Silicon Valley not too many women were

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:24,190
even interested in playing getting back

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:27,950
into the arcades starting with pong and

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,950
pong is like ping pong with a nice

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,250
little Mook

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:35,920
Boop back and forth and this is what the

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,700
consoles look like and this is what it

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,000
looked like when you were actually

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,160
playing and I hiked long a little bit

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,810
not so much but I preferred Atari

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,830
breakout and was more fun and more

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:53,260
colorful but the game I really liked at

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,860
the time which was the breakout game was

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,960
space invaders a little bit like jaws

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,940
and it was fun and it was getting louder

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,910
and louder and faster and faster as

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,340
you're killing these aliens that are

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:10,320
coming down and moving and shooting also

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,550
at you and a little alien up there

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,440
another arcade game that was fun was

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:21,010
defender and just the reason I mentioned

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,230
joust is because ready player one was a

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:26,350
movie that came out recently it was a

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,270
fun movie and it helped inspire this

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,220
talk because I thought well the guy who

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:33,910
wrote ready player one played all these

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,640
games I played a lot of games so that's

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,290
why I'm talking about it

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,570
jost was more important in the book

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,270
which I read of course then the movie

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,470
which have two people most people who

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,000
see the movie they don't need to read

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:51,250
the book I'm not like that but and

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,640
another game that I played a little bit

00:25:51,250 --> 00:26:01,780
but was more important in the movie was

00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:05,890
Galaxian the huge huge winning arcade

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,990
game that caused hundreds of millions of

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:11,800
dollars of revenue to the arcade

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:14,980
industry after space invaders was

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,320
pac-man and lots of women like to play

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,990
pac-man and they didn't seem to have a

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,500
big preference for Miss pac-man but they

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:26,620
did like it and there was Donkey Kong

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:30,670
and then there's Silicon Valley Games

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,940
now back to text

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,480
there's covered up here but your little

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,730
guy is rogue and in these boxes there'll

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,160
be some villains and you go and kill

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,610
them that was rogue I like that

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,830
it was

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:51,640
but you can see here list of your

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:53,620
inventory then there were the early

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,500
personal computers which were game

00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,230
playing machines like this Atari and I

00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,120
had a friend who had an Atari and one of

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,090
the things about the Atari is hooking up

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,850
for joysticks to it so this game dandy

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,950
which was not a very well-known game it

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,800
has 1 player mode you can have 4 players

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,870
in it and then you have 4 guys here that

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:18,580
are shooting the heck out of these guys

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:22,030
and you go down levels ABCDE we got to

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:26,830
about Q but we were having a fun time

00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:28,210
drinking too so we had a ton of fun

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,610
and there's four of us with the

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:35,200
joysticks just blazing away the that was

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,120
my friend who had an Atari I had a

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,610
Commodore 64 which looked a bit like

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,860
this and this was one of the games arch

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,200
on which is a little bit different

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,080
because it's a chest type game but with

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,560
different characters and when two

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,320
characters meet there's a not an

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,360
automatic win you go into a little

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,380
battle area and you fight it out like a

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:04,060
little arcade game but the appropriate

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:10,360
stronger piece so sorry

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:13,750
we typically win but not always and like

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,620
I said I had a Commodore 64 so I did

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,320
play lode runner I did play for it

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:25,330
apocalypse and I did play excalibur

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,450
annex II Oliver was a fantasy take over

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,030
England game where you have to do

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:34,270
different diplomacy with the other

00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,820
people and you have different wealth and

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:40,810
taxes and army and you have gifts and

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,290
honour and ways of getting with other

00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,290
people

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,000
Phoenix I'm not going to go into Phoenix

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:53,140
it's a very complex game the rules are

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,510
94 pages long I really liked it it would

00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:58,550
be diplomacy take over the galaxy

00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,850
and you have factions you have alliances

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,950
you have battles it was a lot of fun it

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,220
took up a huge amount of my time

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,310
far more than it's worth Tetris was

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,770
another game very fun taking up a good

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:16,760
amount of time I mention it because the

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,680
3d text Tetris I was not so much fun to

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,440
me but this guy

00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,940
Andres Negev he was a friend of the he

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,780
was the Russian friend of the guy who

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,390
did Tetris and he was one of the key

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,300
programmers of 3d Tetris so when I came

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,700
to Slovakia in 1991 before I came to

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,770
Slovakia I had a three month a Eurail

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:41,060
pass in Europe so I spent a week and a

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:45,770
half in Moscow at Andres Negev house in

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:48,590
an 18-story panel act some of which have

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:52,160
been falling down and they had rats in

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:55,670
their shoots where you put the garbage

00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,520
in and it goes down you they have

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:03,710
beautiful subways though at the time I

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:05,660
was kind of surprised Ultimate Frisbee

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,240
I played Ultimate Frisbee in Silicon

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,480
Valley I urge all of you to play

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,360
Ultimate Frisbee it's a fun game it's

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,450
also I think the best game for men and

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:22,970
women to play together in terms of

00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:26,030
physically in kind of a no-contact fair

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:32,420
way and you can see there's a lot of

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:35,360
mixed teams in in Ultimate Frisbee we're

00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,930
at the point where another game Game of

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,620
Thrones

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:42,020
well it's politics Iran has a

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,990
libertarian candidate in California a

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,190
couple of times because I'm very

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,310
politically I was very politically

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:53,800
oriented then I came to Slovakia as an

00:30:49,310 --> 00:31:01,040
adviser to a Yantra Nagurski because

00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:03,680
this guy Tim Evans was paid by or funded

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,170
by the Adam Smith Institute in the UK to

00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,260
be on China gorski's advisor when he was

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:12,370
a vice prime minister but at that

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:16,050
time 1991 met er you have to tell me

00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,050
when I have ten minutes five minutes

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:29,950
okay so this is his wedding 10 years

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:33,940
later and most of these people I met

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:37,050
here in Slovakia because of this issue

00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,100
and I focused on privatization

00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:43,090
minesweeper that was a game

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:45,700
Castle Wolfenstein another game this was

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:47,320
a good game this was the first person

00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,540
shooter I'm not big on first-person

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,180
shooters but this was a really good game

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,160
Sid Meier's Civilization that's a great

00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,740
game I'm big on this kind of game in

00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,640
this case American civilization

00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,140
destroyed by Indians

00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:09,870
nice big game that I loved Age of

00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:12,600
Empires and sorry

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:15,400
it's coming

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,670
mental disk orders here in Slovakia

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:23,860
there's actually lots of good ultimate

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:26,200
disc players now and when I was here I

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,870
was among the people who were helping

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,680
found that and so I'm glad that that's

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:35,080
happening here's why I'm staying my

00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,900
beautiful wife and I love dancing and

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,660
she wants to stay here secret for

00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,660
marriage do the things that are easy for

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:46,720

make her happy do there's ten things

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,970
five of them are easy do those five

00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,610
things argue about the other ones but if

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,140
it's easy for you do them it's easy for

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,110

pretty flexible I have four kids and

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:06,730
here they are but this is 12 years ago

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,640
when Michael and Daniel were still young

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:14,710
and just starting to play Age of

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:18,780
Mythology daughter Bianca this was at

Del in one of their Mikolaj things and

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:24,679
that was for those three

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,649
I was the year before or the summer

00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:33,139

play tighten by email and you can play

00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:44,210
tighten on a computer and it's a great

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,480
game Don Woods and Tom Lehman are two

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:52,029
people who were involved in game playing

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:56,379
in Silicon Valley other games

00:33:52,029 --> 00:34:00,649
Settlers of Catan labyrinth Carcassonne

00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:03,129
hears Age of Mythology and we still play

00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:05,990
that and the reason we still play it

00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:09,500
it's still working or we will play it

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,169

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:47,299
was written by this guy Tom Lehman that

00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,400
was the guy back at Stanford that I met

00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:51,859
who was a friend of Don woods who did

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,920
the adventure games and we would all

00:35:51,859 --> 00:36:01,880

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,230
the fun games now we get to the content

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,660
it's probably and insta pendant I'm just

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,150
going to zip through these is a blog

00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:54,769
that I read and they typically have a

00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,390
very short piece of news sometimes a

00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:58,869
little bit so you can decide whether you

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:05,839
want to click on it and get more details

00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:09,079
some of my blogs I wrote one that was

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,960
going to be for my family which I I

00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,839
stopped writing most of these blogs but

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,690
they're quickly Hayek in Slovakia was

00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,150
going to be economics weblog ABCs was

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,619
going to be about web blogs software

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,710
projects was going to be about software

00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,990
projects a world association of

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,359
international studies was actually this

00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,910
long email that I was getting from this

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,750
guy Ronald Hilton from Stanford very

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:38,059
interesting stuff but once it's not on

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,970
the on the web you know there's the talk

00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:43,160
about Google if you can't find it so I

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:46,190
was making a blog and I was copying his

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,480
letter into this blog so that it could

00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:52,830
be found

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,920
then I started blogging more on mo time

00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,300
more time is now dead so it's gone you

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,550
can find a little bit of this stuff

00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,960
through the wayback machine where

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:09,240
there's three billion three hundred

00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:12,450
billion web pages stored so I looked up

00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:19,190
mine and I could go through more neo

00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:21,090
neocon ask blog is more economics

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,430
comments or what makes a really good

00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:29,520
blog so this is a comment that I wrote

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:34,440
on the ask blog economic issue PJ Media

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,720
you can have blogs in a PDA form low

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,040
graphics but I don't like that so much

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,140
even though it's better for smartphones

00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,970
you can have it with the RSS feed but I

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,180
don't like those and you can have

00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:52,910
monetization which I also don't use yet

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:57,330
or bj media that's was pajamas media

00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:59,400
that's the PJ Facebook my love hate

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:02,400
relationship with Facebook here's my

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,000
wife this is our Christmas picture last

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,860
year this was a picture of 12 years ago

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,710
or 10 years ago so family what's on my

00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,830
mind you know it says what's on my line

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,870
but I just don't like Facebook that much

00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:21,690
but it's kind of like blogging so I'm

00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:24,960
gonna be doing it more oh and you see

00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,310
there's a not six of us but there's

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,070
seven us of us

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:32,670
that's because Victoria gray is my

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:35,190
oldest son Michael's wife so when she

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,140
wrote Victoria gray I was wondering who

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:45,480
is that person because I knew her is

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:50,580
Vicki that's like okay one of the things

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:54,450
is they do have a Age of Mythology group

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:58,500
for the for our family to play swipe the

00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:01,800
have League of Legends Trump on Twitter

00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I don't I was suspended from Twitter for

00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,320
retweeting something of Trump I had made

00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,450
zero tweets but I was suspended for four

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,490
months they've recently not suspended me

00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,400
but I'm not going to be using it except

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:18,360
to watch what Trump says and this is

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,360
another guy who's very Pro Trump and is

00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:25,980
kind of a jerk about it almost these

00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:28,530
guys power line two guys are pretty fair

00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:32,550
and one guy is kind of anti Trump but a

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:37,250
pretty reasonable anti Trump and finally

00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:40,790
WordPress I have a wordpress blog and

00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,970
comparing blacks to blacks is that it

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,610
okay

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:54,060
I have other slides that could go on and

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:57,300
on and on I won't even mention it but

00:40:54,060 --> 00:41:05,720
okay let's get to the future design okay

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:05,720
