they can volunteer so this presentation

00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,500
is supposed to be in English but are

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,740
there any English speakers okay so then

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,339
we'll stick with the English great so

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,939
welcome

00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:20,470
I'm IO I'm the CEO sparring that is one

00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:23,140
of the first legal supports for the

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:27,040
digital entrepreneurs here in the CEO

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,309
region and as you probably know I'm a

00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,590
lawyer but I would like to tell you that

00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:35,170
people and the lawyers especially are

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,840
nasty people and when having your own

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,780
business you would like to spend as

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,250
little time with them as possible and

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,760
therefore this presentation would be

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,000
basically a short guideline how to avoid

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:54,730
oil as much as possible throughout the

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,720
five rather easy easy steps so this

00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,760
would be the outline so a cow five areas

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,989
where basically every single digital

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:09,580
entrepreneur and experiences is his or

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:12,790
her life cycle of the of the business so

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,530
first of all when you do have an idea or

00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,220
set up your own business it's really

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,590
easy for you to really start without any

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,270
corporate presence just as a Friday

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,610
night project with your friends you can

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,400
build up the product then test it maybe

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,470
even introduce it however there are some

00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,920
reason for you to a suitable a corporate

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,229
entity but if you would like to really

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,750
transfer the IP or you would like to

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:41,440
receive an investment or you would like

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,530
to really on board some clients and get

00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,180
some invoices running then the company

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,630
set up is something you should really

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:53,650
think about and there are basically two

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,510
things you should really think about the

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,740
first of all is the geography and the

00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,530
region where we like to set up the

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,470
entity and secondly is DS deform so

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,650
there are three usual suspects first of

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,330
all is the surprisingly sea region so

00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:11,310
there is a good news the good news is

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,989
that to help a corporation or a company

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,170
set up here in the industry region is

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,290
actually a good

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:22,599
think when it comes to the

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:25,220
maneuverability the is ease of control

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,440
Slovakia Czech Republic Hungary are

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,239
pretty pretty good for that in each and

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,390
every single country there is a limited

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,120
liability company and basically in every

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,110
single country you can set up it rather

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,900
easily run it very cheaply furthermore

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,870
when it comes to the sea region there

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,959
are a number of other advantages for you

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,810
to really set up the company so first of

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,500
all as a sea region tries to really

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,489
interesting you know invite

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,569
entrepreneurs and innovation and

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:02,330
everything there are a number of texts

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,880
basically supplements or incentives for

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,970
you to really set up your own business

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,950
so for instance there is a tax deduction

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,860
for the R&D especially in Slovakia like

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,650
one month ago the text deduction was

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,870
raised to 200% so basically if you are

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,959
doing an R&D for instance also in

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,100
digital business usually it's a

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,920
development of complex back-end

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,760
technologies but it really depends then

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,350
you're basically amount of money that's

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,060
going to be text is going to be

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,750
decreased significantly

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,350
also there are favorable IP transfers

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,359
and also there is a very fine text

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,720
regime especially for instance in

00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,730
Hungary so if you would dare to commute

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,859
by the public transport to Reika

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:53,030
which is the closest Hungarian village

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:56,450
next to Slovakia then also the you will

00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,140
face with a very favorable income income

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,010
tax not mentioning that it's also also

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,959
envisaged that maybe an Estonian

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,530
corporate model will be basically set up

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,739
in here saying that the taxation will be

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,260
not processed each by by the end of each

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,650
and every year but basically the

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,109
taxation will be basically withheld

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,639
until the distribution of the profit so

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,430
basically we'll be able to keep your

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,590
funds in the company invest them to your

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,620
Grove or to the to the people or to the

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,120
assets and all

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,240
texts them while we would like to really

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,150
distribute the profits to to you and so

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,520
that you don't need to be anxious every

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,960
October or November in optimization of

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,280
your of your business

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,690
so see region is quite quite good then

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,870
there is a offshore and we are not going

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,690
to discuss any Caribbean adventures but

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,120
there is all offshore within also EU

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,070
region so for instance Estonia that

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,470
actually is very favorable when it comes

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,410
to the investment of new businesses that

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,150
you need don't need to tax your income

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,220
every single year but you need to wait

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,440
until only until the distribution of the

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,460
profit then there are countries such as

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,930
Malta and Cyprus however be careful

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,870
because every single tax authority

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,810
actually when they see the such such

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,360
company from from Cyprus or from

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,740
whatever Malta Luxembourg Netherlands

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,210
there is a red flag

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,520
basically ringing and actually my god

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,620
control you might get the double text so

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,200
be careful if you are setting up a

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,389
business somewhere outside Slovakia or

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,160
some somewhere else make sure that

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,169
actually real business operations of

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,400
your company are happening in there

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,169
so either you do have a sales

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,419
representative over there or some

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,150
development or some marketing strategy

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,880
or any other corporate presence because

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,440
if you want to fake it then actually you

00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,680
can really face a double taxation as a

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,229
one of the number of penalties thirdly

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,270
our very favorite is the Western Europe

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,699
and the US why well because of the

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,550
investors in Czechoslovakia they are

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,139
approximately ten to fifteen investment

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,620
funds some of them are actually

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:19,830
investing public money for instance this

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,830
year around 30 and then maybe even 70

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:27,180
million of euros shall be invested in

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,919
Slovakia European money these money 10%

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,590
are going to be invested here in Bharti

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,840
Slava region whereas the 90% are going

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,030
to be invested in the in the regions of

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,570
Psilakis basically central and eastern

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:43,020
eastern part alongside that there is all

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,150
of our private money basically here

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,949
on the other hand what I would say and

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,330
what's our experience is that local

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,280
investors do lack a good I would say

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,830
strategic approach basically it's a

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,930
demain money so if you receive a money

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,949
from the local investors very likely

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,410
they will not be able to help you to

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,220
provide you a global global scale do

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,470
some door-opening

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,070
support your own business if you would

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,979
like to really search for smart money

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:17,190
investors such as speed invest in in in

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,590
Vienna or some other investment funds or

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,850
other NGOs in the Indy from from the

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,850
Western Europe that can really support

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,190
your scale then it's much more favorable

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,680
for you to loose a table a foreign

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,410
entity in the Western Europe or us where

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,479
actually they really understand the

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,370
jurisdiction you will raise their trust

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,110
and therefore you will be more likely to

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:41,190
receive those funds when it comes to the

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,780
so this is the basically the

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,180
distribution of the regions when it

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,510
comes to the basic forms well there is

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,320
one trick fuels ago a specially for

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,820
starter person individual innovators a

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,700
simplified joint-stock company was

00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:03,720
established in Slovakia meaning IDO Luca

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:05,729
activist poach toast and then now many

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,590
many lawyers and many experts basically

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:12,690
say yeah this is for startups go for it

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,430
well but this is a trap so limited the

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,669
simplified joint-stock company is

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,340
actually tough you need to communicate

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,160
with four different public authorities

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,729
it's not only commercial register open e

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,660
register but also national depository of

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,789
the of the Securities than the and other

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,909
other authorities so first of all it's

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,919
more more difficult secondly you need to

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,450
really pay for the all accounts and

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,640
every single transaction and the mission

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,180
of the stocks so it's more more

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,040
expensive and also to administer such

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,380
simplified you instant company it's not

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,750
simplified at all you really need

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,459
somebody who will basically support you

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,970
on this one provide the general

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,879
assembly's submit

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,129
filing documentation etc etc so it's not

00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,709
easy at all and you will definitely need

00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:05,079
a legal support therefore first step to

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,060
avoid a lawyer is to set up a zero

00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,480
meaning limited liability company

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,819
basically this company can have up to 50

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,040
shareholders so basically with that you

00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,120
can really support your business for

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,529
years to come

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,139
once you will scale you will have

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:23,410
hundreds of employees dozens of dozens

00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,149
of shareholders then okay maybe simplify

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,449
the joint stock company make mess make

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,120
make sense for you but until that once

00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,680
you have like team of dozens people then

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,889
it's really the limited liability

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,779
company is very simple fast solution you

00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:41,430
can basically found it by a film

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,959
arranges car or any other a non-legal

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,600
user-friendly solution so within within

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,709
a weeks or even days

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,569
therefore you should you should

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:54,160
definitely go for this one and be aware

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:56,439
of the simplified unstuck company okay

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,149
so once you have a company then you

00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:59,680
usually have some co-founders sometimes

00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,600
you're on your own of course and this is

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,850
not really relevant for you but very

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,410
often you do end up with the co-founders

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,649
of yours since you would like to really

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,670
have a diverse I know how attached to

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,519
your business now very often the

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,350
founders are friends right and I'd the

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,319
usual assumptions is I don't need a

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,459
really a agreement with a friend of mine

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,040
or a family of mine

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,290
why will you do that right I mean we are

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,199
friends there's no need for us to really

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:32,170
set up an agreement the problem is once

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:35,949
the money comes in either through

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:39,339
investment or through the first through

00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:42,519
first client then actually the

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,589
agreements that were agreed few years

00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,829
ago or a few months ago may have been

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,529
differently remembered or actually some

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:53,439
of them just would like to exploit the

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,449
situation and therefore very often and

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:57,699
we experience very often the dispute

00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:00,069
between the founders not having a proper

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,839
agreement between themselves so the

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:05,730
least you can do for in order to

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,889
basically prevent future future disputes

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,029
actually and keep good

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,559
friends is to set up a good contract

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,540
between yourselves called the

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,759
shareholders agreement now the

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,529
shareholders agreement is perfect thing

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,269
because not only it prevents the dispute

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,959
but it can even support your business

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,369
and we go through that so first of all

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,579
the thing is if you establish a company

00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:31,049
like the limited liability company and

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,989
you have all your co-founder so what do

00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:37,290
we do well first of all you will split

00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:38,879
the shares right 50/50 and then this is

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,980
the thing the other founder will receive

00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,410
a 50% of the of the company are going to

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,169
build and in envisage or imagine the

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,639
situation where the second founder after

00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:50,669
six months will have a child or

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,309
something and will leave the company but

00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,139
he or she keeps the 50% of the company

00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,259
regardless of her actions or inactions

00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,779
on your behalf meaning you can work for

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,029
years and yet your co-founder that is

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,100
passive will still keep 50% of the

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,139
company well this is not a fair right

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,299
and also not only he keeps the fee or

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,179
she it keeps the 50% of the company

00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,410
those 50% will be missing to you when

00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,629
you like to invest the funds or

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,959
distribute it to your employees etc etc

00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:21,660
therefore you should think about vesting

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,029
now Westing is something that you agree

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,839
at the very beginning that okay we get

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,819
the company as agreed 50/50 but we

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,649
commit ourselves to stay and work

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,379
actively for the company for at least I

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,970
don't know two three four years three to

00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,419
four years is the basically market

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:43,589
standard if one person basically leaves

00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:46,470
the company then basically it's obliged

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,009
to return the equity to the company or

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,839
to you as the founder now it can be very

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,389
variable for instance we can say that

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,980
okay either you need to stay there for

00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,169
four years and if not you lose

00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,759
everything which is not really fair but

00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:01,230
we can do we can say it can be

00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,439
proportionate and we can set up a

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,660
one-year cliffs saying that if I leave

00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:09,449
after two years well I need to return

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,220
only half of the equity promised to me

00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,470
if I leave after one year

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,509
well I returned three quarters of the

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,749
other of their shares so basically the

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:20,730
founder is actually motivated and

00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:21,150
stimulated to stay in the company for

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,490
the

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,810
to come and also in the best times for

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,360
instance them previously

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm from the vacuum labs the company

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,500
that has like two hundred people right

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,630
now here in mostly CA region but three

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,460
years ago there were like 20 20 of us

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,900
and there were three co-founders one of

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,420
sales one octa work and one was CEO if

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,700
any of those founders would leave the

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,020
company at the dead stage the company

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,880
would not be successful at all and

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,720
probably would not survive at all the

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,220
best thing was one of the key actually

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,050
stimulations for them to really stay

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,980
together even if the numbers were not

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,350
good too good

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,540
or even if the personal situation of one

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,010
of the founders was not very good so the

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,160
best thing is good motivation to really

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,730
keep the team together and there are a

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,860
number of ways how we can really make it

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:13,260
secondly founders living close this is

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,750
closely related to the to the vesting so

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,360
it can be also there can be some

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,550
additional additional obligations for

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,870
instance the founder would say okay I

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,690
cannot quit like next next day my

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,810
leaving period needs to be at least a

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,810
year and throughout the year I am forced

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,170
or obliged to train a basically

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,420
substitution on my behalf say leaving

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,550
the company with a good other person

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,920
getting to the company on the particular

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,170
role of the leaving founder such

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,480
obligation is again one of the vital

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,240
vital supplement of the company in the

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,339
bed bed times also there is a dilution

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,650
for angels so basically we do have an ID

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,660
and you're building your product so

00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,810
basically already really digital product

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,360
startup you need the first investment

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:07,470
enabling you to build a first MVP or

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,820
demo or whatever for that you know the

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,950
first money are really the most

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,600
important ones but then of course you

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,150
have only slides and an idea and maybe

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,890
one Excel or maybe just a few few lines

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,620
of code and then the angels are

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,959
reluctant for you to invest and they

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,150
require a huge amount of equity which is

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,470
bad because then you lose the equity for

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,930
the other rounds and other investors and

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,450
your other co-founders there for what

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,910
may be done is that if new investor

00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,269
comes to the company basically every

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,089
single other shareholder

00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:39,819
is going to be diluted so basically his

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:42,519
or her share is going to be decreased

00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:44,589
proportionately to the increase of the

00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,050
share of the new shareholder however

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,790
this might not be done proportionately

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,980
and there are different ways for

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,779
instance we can actually say that okay

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,790
so if you are an angel and you really

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,040
invest the first manage the company you

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,029
really show your trust you may dilute

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,920
your share slowly like in your pace

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,290
might be 50 percent slower than the

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,290
dilution of the others for instance such

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,839
motivation we will incentivize the new

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,939
angels and new investors that give money

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,339
on the table to really support your idea

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:20,680
and can really help you in raising the

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:22,449
funds thirdly fourthly very often you do

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,029
end up with your employees having some

00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:28,120
shares or with this early 8 early stage

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,040
founders and then H actually you need to

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,189
protect them because you know if you if

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,769
you do have like 5% or turn 10% of the

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:38,170
company you cannot actually really steer

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,939
it you cannot really control it but if

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,040
in the shareholders agreement there are

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:44,499
good minority shareholders protection

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,279
mechanisms such as tag-along right or I

00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:47,829
don't know

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,170
shootout or whatever then actually the

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,569
minority shareholders can have a trust

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,610
that although they are very small and

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:56,679
they can steer the company they cannot

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,120
be fooled so for instance it can be done

00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,040
as it was done in Facebook that

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,230
basically you will erase the capital of

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,270
the company by few thousand percent and

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,740
then the shareholder from five percent

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,010
will end up with zero zero five percent

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,990
right so the such mechanisms can be

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,059
included in the shareholders agreement

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,679
and basically the minority investors can

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,980
really have a trust that it cannot be

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,990
tricked very easily and there is a

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,939
shootout for instance that can provide

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,039
you and actually provide you with the

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,480
tools how you can overcome a deadlock so

00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,850
basically the situation where you need

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,710
to adopt a decision but you do not have

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,909
the necessary majority so basically

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,169
there it might be a shootout which is

00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:35,529
very complex mechanism but it can really

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:39,070
work also it's really important is that

00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:40,840
you know if you divide right 50/50 it's

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,610
the worst actually division that can be

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,649
made because you always need a second

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,690
partner to agree so either you have a

00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,360
casting vote so we say okay if there is

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,450
a you

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,070
equal vote one shoot the CEO usually

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,620
should help the casting role and say

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,080
okay if there is a Equality my word

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,080
prevails ideally should have a at least

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,390
a three three co-founders etc etcetera

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,160
also when you are basically attaching

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,250
the voting rights beware that your

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,110
company she'll probably glow grow new

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,970
people will come new shareholders will

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,070
come new investors will come and those

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,040
who will require some votes now you

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,630
still need you you need your votes to

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,660
steal the company because we have the

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,799
votes your company is not your at all

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,490
therefore when thinking about the right

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,410
please

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,419
think at least two or three or four

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,210
years ahead what may happen to your

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,429
company and be able to keep as much

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,110
voting power you need for the particular

00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,510
decisions especially for the entry of

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,660
the new investors exit of the company or

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:42,950
all the other street strategic strategic

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:44,720
stuff cool so this is the founders now

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,090
we have a company we have a founders

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,679
agreement and then we can come to the

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,370
intellectual property so basically in

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,400
our business everything related the code

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:59,510
and to the digital stuff is basically

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,770
transferred to your clients via transfer

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,900
of intellectual property now there are

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,640
different types of that so first of all

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,299
is a copyright and it's the best one I

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,390
really love it

00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:10,700
because basically it doesn't cost you

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,559
anything to create it doesn't cost you

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,210
anything to register it actually doesn't

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,580
need to be registered and can be

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,880
actually registered and there it's

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:22,280
basically created upon the creation of

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,860
the code or the design or the website or

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,990
whatever the only thing with the

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,360
copyright is you should be able to

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:33,380
really track its origins in Slovakia

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,679
intellectual property and especially

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:41,870
copyright can only be created by people

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:45,200
by entities made of flesh and bones not

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,520
by the companies therefore if you have

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,730
your company and you have some

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,010
contractors of yr limited liability

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,440
companies and everything make sure that

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,630
those limited liability companies those

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,830
Aceros basically providing the license

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,529
to you

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,629
get the license from the people on the

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,289
first place because otherwise you have

00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:08,539
no certainty that actually the license

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:12,669
was acquired by the limited liability

00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:15,649
company also the IP Clause is already

00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:18,019
very very very tricky secondly the

00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:21,710
trademark now sometimes especially once

00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:23,690
you do have like b2c business you would

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,549
like your brand to be recognized for

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,619
that you would need a trademark now

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:29,480
trademarks are great because they

00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:31,639
doesn't cost very much but they need to

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,499
be registered now it's impossible

00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:34,999
basically to register the trademark in

00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,549
every single country it would be

00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,649
time-consuming it would be expensive but

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,239
there are some per

00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:42,799
good good shortcuts so first of all if

00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,109
your business is only in Slovakia then

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,299
it's easy you'll fight for 200 euros an

00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:50,509
application here in Slovakia if you do

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:52,549
have a European white business then you

00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,489
can file automatically a European white

00:20:52,549 --> 00:21:00,379
trademark does maybe not covering the UK

00:20:55,489 --> 00:21:03,019
in awhile but still via for 850 euros

00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:06,710
you can get a trademark covering whole

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,989
EU area so like 2758 Member States which

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,779
is very decent boost for your continuous

00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:14,029
business also what you can do there is a

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,769
special regime covering like hundred

00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:17,720
twenty countries which is called an

00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,460
international trademark this is bit more

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,710
costly like three thousand but then you

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,080
can really cover most of the most of the

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,139
world so really to set up your trademark

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,119
significantly increases the value of

00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,919
your business protects your business

00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,350
against the competitors trying to really

00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,869
free right on your brand and also does

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,989
not it's not that expensive when it

00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:40,879
comes the patent is a third usual usual

00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:43,359
type of intellectual property although

00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,409
there are some more but the patent

00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,600
especially digital business is not

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,029
widely used is mostly related to the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,730
healthcare if any and this is rather

00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,899
difficult and also expensive so yeah if

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,429
there is a possibility for you to

00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:57,409
protect your intellectual property where

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,759
copyright or trademark go for it the

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:05,720
patent is rather not very user-friendly

00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:09,529
ok and then the yeah so we have company

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,299
we have founders we have IP and now I'm

00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,749
pro employee share schemes so where

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:17,210
very beginning for you to really set up

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:19,159
your own business and be able to be able

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,080
to compete with the competition out

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,869
there you need to need the best people

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,369
now at the very beginning you don't

00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,200
haven't that much money to really pay

00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,600
for for the best people and therefore

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,460
employee share scheme may be put to the

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,159
place if you have an employee share

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,860
scheme it allows you to basically fill

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,350
think two things equals the pay of the

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,600
of the great people working for you

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,710
why equity not where money you don't

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,559
have usually and secondly it the the

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,289
employees of yours put your their skin

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,580
in the game so basically once the person

00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:57,289
is ready to accept your equity not only

00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,609
the person says I believe in your

00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,679
company but secondly

00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:02,149
it becomes also the co-founder or at

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,299
least a shareholder of the company

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:07,340
having said that basically the

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,559
expectations and the intentions and

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,049
incentives of yourself and your

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,179
employees are pretty much the same are

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,980
aligned and this is very important for

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,230
your business so the employee share

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,960
scheme has significant significant

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,109
benefits and there are basically four

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,179
four levels of how formally we like to

00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:29,419
be now the good news is you don't need a

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:31,940
lawyer again for at least one or two or

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,789
the two types so most of the companies

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,059
start with a trust me spreadsheet having

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,279
said that having an Excel names of the

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:43,419
people and some percentage written

00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,789
alongside their name such a spreadsheet

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:48,440
actually is a legally binding ish can

00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,330
work for a year or two or especially

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,249
once your business is small and can

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,090
really stimulate those people without

00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:58,039
making any formal formal registrations

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,409
or anything number of companies in

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,679
Slovakia run by this and actually it

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:05,869
really works in it although it it's not

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,129
formal it actually there is some binding

00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:12,409
and you can really claim it on a court

00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:15,249
ish but also it really you get the you

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,239
significantly get the motivation

00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:20,840
incentives and skin in the game of your

00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:22,940
people bit stronger level is the

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,950
basically you can include the people

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,720
into your shareholders agreement

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,630
so basically they can exceed to it and

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,670
they become a shareholders themselves

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,610
being applicable all the Westing rights

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,990
founders living clauses etc etc although

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,960
they aren't founders they may have bit

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,270
more lenient and easier regime it's easy

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,530
to set up but usually for the good

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,570
shareholders agreement you should have

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,070
some at least some legal support but

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,010
then you can really run for years

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:52,040
without any without any change a third

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,960
one is options now options are tricky

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,290
because basically what they do is that

00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,140
you receive an option that after

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,660
completion of some conditions like in

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,650
three years working for the company I

00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,570
may acquire official shares now option

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,360
is great because basically it pushes all

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,030
the registration stuff all the all the

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,210
all the costs all the administration for

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:20,300
the years to come but usually when you

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,010
have your business now in today the

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,950
business may be valued for I don't know

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,110
hundred K but in three years time the

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,090
business can grow to like four hundred K

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,550
now if you receive and you will try to

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,270
distribute to really consume the option

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:38,420
in three years time basically the your

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,010
taxation regime may actually basically

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,860
be much stronger because you receive

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,840
more value for the share because the

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,120
company is bigger and therefore your

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,080
taxation obligation may be may be

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,730
stronger so be aware with with options

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,280
although they are easy today they may

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,140
not be that easy in the a three or four

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,840
year time especially if the company's

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,390
growing if it's stable then it's okay

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,250
last thing is the real shares now the

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:08,720
real shares of of course are the most

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,430
formal act it costs the most but with a

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,750
limited liability company not that much

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:16,730
and also and also it provides the

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,130
biggest amount of certainty and

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,260
commitment of your employees it's

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,090
publicly accessible it's really hard for

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,620
you to really trick your people so the

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,300
minority shareholders have a good

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,360
certainty that you are going to really

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,220
keep your keep your promises especially

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,640
when distributing the profit or when it

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,430
comes to the to the exit so yeah and

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,450
from our experience basically maybe half

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,249
of our

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,389
portfolio companies and partners and

00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:46,970
clients you usually use these and

00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:49,519
actually it works really really well so

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,899
and the last thing is that if you do

00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:56,059
have a company and the brand and the

00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:58,850
founders living close and even employees

00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,799
then you should somehow contract them as

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,080
I've said the intellectual property is

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,419
not passing to you without a written

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,830
agreement therefore you should have

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,859
actually some written agreement and

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,960
there are basically three basic types

00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:13,730
there number of mutations or variations

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,399
but the three basic types how you can

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:19,129
really employ the person and these types

00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:21,080
are the same also in the in the in the

00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:23,809
in the broad so it's pretty pretty

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,100
similar so first one is the employment

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,269
contract now the employment contract

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,879
it's twofold

00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,639
there are huge cons and huge pros so

00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:34,369
first of all the worst thing about the

00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:35,950
employment contract it two things first

00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:38,989
of all is the taxation that is high

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,799
secondly the issue is that it's not

00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,600
flexible

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,309
now with the startup you often need the

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,980
flexibility you will find out that ok I

00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,559
don't have my cash flow runway is like 2

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,450
or 3 or 4 weeks then you really need to

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,769
restructure your company with the

00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,359
employment contract it's not that easy

00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:58,609
because the people are protected by the

00:27:53,359 --> 00:28:01,759
labor code secondly therefore it's not

00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:03,259
great what is good employment contract

00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,029
is for the protection of your employees

00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,730
and they are very well protected and

00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,619
also is great for the transfer of

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:13,190
intellectual property you don't need to

00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:15,769
have any IP agreement any license

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,129
agreement automatically based on the

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:22,700
based on the legislation everything made

00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:24,649
by your employees passes on to you even

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,210
in the broader broader sense so

00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:29,440
basically this is very good for the

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,659
transfer of their IP if if necessary

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,799
also there is a this freelancing regime

00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:38,629
which is the widely used mostly because

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,460
the taxation regime is really favorable

00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:45,859
and it's going to be even more favorable

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:48,289
next year and however you should be you

00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:50,480
should be really cautious when it comes

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,070
to the transfer of the IP your license

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,380
agreement needs to be trusted

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,000
well so that all the IP created alright

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,310
as much as possible or as much as

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,710
allowed by the legislation will pass on

00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,990
to you so that you can really sell it

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,940
sell it to the other third parties or

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,730
use yourself or at least have

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:10,610
exclusivity of the of the I piece of the

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:13,550
dye people won't be sold by your by your

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,750
employee to the four or four four or

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:19,550
five other other companies as well

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,310
lastly there is a b2b relationship

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:26,290
now this anthemic does not make any

00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:28,520
sense when you have just an ordinary

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,310
developer working for you usually

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,460
because it's more complex you need to

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:38,390
have an accountant you need to file bit

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,620
more complex tax filings every year so

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,620
it did really make sense if you have a

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,240
significant significant income and then

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,810
you can really play with the costs

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,270
around so this is not widely used

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:53,420
although when the income is high it

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:55,190
might be what you should really think

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:59,810
about and I've mentioned it previously

00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:04,850
is the IP beware of that because a

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:08,030
company cannot create the IP the human

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:11,090
does therefore sometimes if you have a

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,710
look like client that is regulated such

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,930
as bank and you're developing something

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,330
for the bank they may come and say okay

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:20,300
so proof that you really acquired the IP

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,790
right from your developers and then the

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,710
agreement the agreement with the there

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,150
as a limited liability company would not

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,800
be enough you would need to provide

00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,120
actually the contract between the

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,640
company they will meet a level two

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,080
company of theirs and themselves some of

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,150
sometimes those contracts may not be

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,310
existent usual they are not and then

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,790
this might be an issue for you so really

00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,470
be careful either you can do a three

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,050
parties contract between the person

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,840
between his or her limited liability

00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,970
company and yourself or there may be at

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,830
least some separate IP transfer

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,470
agreement signed between yourself and

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,640
the person although it's for free so

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,980
there are number of ways how you can

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,170
really deal with it but beware of that

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,920
this is one of the usual mistakes we see

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:05,750
in the innovation companies hearing here

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,030
in Slovakia and also in the region

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:13,190
cool yeah so thank you for the attending

00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:17,600
now I believe there is a there are ten

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:19,490
minutes for for questions then after

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,770
this talk and after the Q&A session I'll

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,480
be outside there are some pillows in

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,490
front of the in front of this hall and

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,520
there will be like another 30 minutes

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,050
for you to come and discuss why our

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,300
workshop we can discuss really the

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,950
issues you have in mind and I'll be more

00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:40,850
than happy to advise and help if

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:42,710
possible so thank you very much okay so

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:45,860
thank you very much and I have a one

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,050
question here would you recommend for

00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:51,530
employees to know each other share

00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:53,740
portion is it needed or not that's a

00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:57,260
good question

00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:00,440
depends I've seen companies trying to be

00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:05,000
less transparent and really trying to

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:08,090
basically not raise envy of the actual

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,560
people and employees and working in a

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,260
company that is very transparent

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,500
having said that all shares are

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,420
basically public or celery's are public

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,400
so that even the developers can come and

00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:24,440
say okay so I'm in the level I don't

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,440
know 14 I earn 3,000 hearings more why

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,110
is that so and then the CTO can discuss

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,580
with the guy or the girl can really say

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,490
okay so if we'd like to get a raise

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,170
these are the KPIs or the knowledge or

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,030
the team you should really be able to

00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,140
handle once you achieve that then you

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,120
can get raised this transparent regime

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,580
especially here in the region it's not a

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,020
widely used minority of the companies

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:52,010
are that transparent when it comes to

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,560
the salaries and the equities but on the

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:58,640
other hand it has its pros if

00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:01,280
communicated correctly lastly some of

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,070
their shareholders or equity regimes are

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,290
transparent by nature having said that

00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,530
if you would say okay I don't have my

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:12,430
Excel the trust me spreadsheet but I

00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,450
would like to have the official shares

00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,190
registered in the register in the

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,410
commercial register then actually it's

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,429
really impossible for you to to hide it

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,099
because it's it's

00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:24,379
publicly accessible so then you should

00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:28,009
also take in the mind the way of the

00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:33,200
distribution of the equity for you okay

00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:35,480
so that's all thank you very much dr.

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,109
kovac receivable simple as gojira's
