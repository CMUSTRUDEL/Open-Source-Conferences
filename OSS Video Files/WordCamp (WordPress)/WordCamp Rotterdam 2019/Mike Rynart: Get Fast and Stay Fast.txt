[Applause]

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,160
welcome everybody well thanks for coming

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,440
to my talk it's really a nice that's

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,670
you're here Oh might okay

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,070
this was an answer

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,869
yeah it's about speeding up your web

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:28,099
sites so my name is Mike Reinhardt I'm I

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,469
live in Rotterdam and I really like

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:36,930
Rotterdam it's my city and yeah I'm

00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:40,140
about making your websites faster I like

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:46,489
faster websites I don't like watching

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:49,440
slow loading screens so yeah I started

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:52,949
when I was a kid I always had a creative

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,160
mind and I didn't make it to art art

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,850
school or an art academy but always kept

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,229
myself creative and by the 90s I started

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,189
fiddling in Geo cities I don't know if

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,990
anybody knows about geo cities all right

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,520
and eventually you started building my

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,020
own web page my first web page online

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,729
Microsoft the front page anybody

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:24,210
familiar with it oh cool yeah it was a

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,840
fun time so at that time you didn't

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,960
really care about speed or optimizing

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,470
for mobile devices because there were no

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,369
but there were no devices to browse the

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,880
internet with so we had a lot of yeah a

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:46,159
lot of creativity to create all kinds of

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,200
websites and the internet then web 1.0

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,380
not wasn't we didn't call it that way

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,380
but it was that's what what it was it

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,229
was one way communication basically one

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,520
big information dump of our web pages

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,460
linked together for your hyperlinks so

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,849
it was fun times but yeah over the years

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,319
I developed my skills from webmaster to

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:15,209
web design

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:19,860
eventually a web developer and yeah

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:22,650
today there are millions of pages and a

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,799
lot of devices that's yeah we have to

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,409
optimize our website for and it's a very

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,069
important these days that our website

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:34,260
loads fast especially on a mobile device

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:39,769
because we have to compete with billions

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,760
of websites so if you look at your

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,090
statistics I don't know about your

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,400
statistics but if I look at my analytics

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,519
I've almost half of the traffic now

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,510
comes from a mobile device sometimes

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,569
even more than that yeah people visit

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:03,120
your your website from a mobile device

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:04,019
so this was a statistic from 2016 from

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,560
StatCounter

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:12,690
and it shows that mobile has over

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:15,359
surpassed desktop traffic well

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,359
especially on mobile speed is important

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:21,599
and according to research it's that's

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:25,109
almost 53 percent of your website

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,480
visitors they will leave your site if if

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:31,379
it takes longer than three seconds to

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,340
load so it could lose like more than

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,109
half of your your web traffic before

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,629
people even see in your site so if you

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,690
leave them waiting with some white

00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,940
loading screens and don't show them that

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,980
anything is happening there are people

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:53,549
that will just click away now this data

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,440
is also not unseen by Google and I Cook

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,889
was paying a very close attention to

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,079
speeds last year they introduced Google

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,680
speed updates I don't know if you guys

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,780
you probably heard about it last week

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,139
there was an article in the news news

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,409
that's after this update and until now

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,620
they saw that the average speed of web

00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,539
pages improved like 20 percent so this

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,600
really helps you to speed up the

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,880
Internet

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,490
but still yeah it takes a long time for

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,090
webpages to loads and according to

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,210
google research it takes there are more

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,360
than 15 seconds for a mogul sites to

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,510
fully loads so that's yeah if you think

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,390
about people who leave your site's if it

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,890
takes longer than three seconds yeah so

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,890
that's way too long

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:52,520
and yeah because web pages are you are

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,710
carrying a lot of weight and we've seen

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,930
over the years that the Internet has

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,290
become heavier and heavier we are

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,790
loading a lot more JavaScript images

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:08,570
videos and the efforts web-based

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:11,510
nowadays I've seen also figures of five

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,390
megabytes or even more but according to

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:20,150
research if more than half is over two

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:23,690
gigabytes well if you consider that the

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,900
old classic game Doom which is a

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,840
first-person shooter with some 3d

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,980
graphics multiple levels sound effects

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,880
with only 2.3 megabytes and today we are

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:42,500
still struggling to just put out a piece

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,940
of web content in the same size so we

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,660
still have some work to do

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,800
so all this weight is really affecting

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,350
the user experience when we keep our

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,230
people visitors waiting with loading

00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,860
screens slow loading web pages

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:04,400
it's affecting the overall experience

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,980
our visitors they don't measure time

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,910
with a stopwatch they measure it with

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:14,330
their brains their their eyes when they

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,470
see a white screen where things don't

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,680
move then

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:22,700
yeah you get people like this throwing

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:27,140
their phone also the big companies they

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:31,460
also know yeah this data there are a lot

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,370
of reports for example Amazon they saw

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,670
saw that for every 100 milliseconds

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,010
their website loads slower they lose

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:43,420
like 1% of sales

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:46,130
that's like billions of dollars so now

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,470
maybe we don't make a billions of

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:52,040
dollars with our website but still yeah

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,860
who wants to lose money well you can

00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,810
find a lot of small reports on this

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,570
website it's called WP wbr stats so if

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:07,130
you ever want to convince your clients

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,850
or buzz to optimize your websites you

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,810
you can find here a lot of interesting

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,850
reports what it

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:22,220
what kind of effect it has on on sales

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:25,250
of visitors engagements so but web

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,460
performance web performance is yeah and

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,350
not really a one one-time thing it's

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,070
like a continuous process

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:39,970
it's a journey that's you continue want

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:43,100
to monitor optimize and measure so and

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:47,450
measurements is in my my eyes that's

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:50,990
really a part of web performance so

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:54,080
before you do any optimization I want to

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,810
start with measuring so find the

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,990
starting points and see what is slowing

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:03,190
you down so there are a lot of tools

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,700
these days that you can that you can use

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:10,730
all of these tools are free to use most

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,350
of them are web-based and they go for

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:19,910
all kinds of yeah interesting figures

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:23,630
like a load time they paid sighs Pingdom

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:28,280
test is another popular tool among

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:32,270
the WordPress community and webpagetest

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:35,599
it's like the industry standards well

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:40,070
all kinds of figures on how your website

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,919
is performing but all these figures yet

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,670
they basically tell ya half of the story

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,420
they don't really tell you how your how

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:55,300
fast your website feels in the eyes of

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:59,630
the visitor so that's one story bouts

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,300
yeah for example how LFA elevators in

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,840
the old days I don't know if you know

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,940
the story but in the early days when in

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,370
New York they were building high-rises

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:15,440
and elevators were introduced people who

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,830
are complaining how ya slow the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,170
elevators were so yeah all kinds of

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,790
engineers were thinking about solution

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:29,290
to speed up the the elevators which cost

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:34,400
a lot of money like using faster engines

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:37,520
all to yeah speed up this elevator but

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,840
then there are one clever engineer he

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,030
came up with a solution

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,730
he said now we don't have to we

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,460
shouldn't focus on the elevators but now

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,160
we need to focus on the users on the

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:53,510
people inside the elevators so what they

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,920
did was a clever invention was to put

00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:01,160
mirrors in the elevator so to distract

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,700
the people inside the elevators so an

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,150
after they put this put these mirrors in

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,150
the elevators they asked the the people

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,830
if they thought the elevators were

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,320
faster or not saying they said yeah

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,650
these are much much faster and the speed

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,580
was exactly the same so it's the story

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:26,750
about elevators but back to the web how

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:32,360
can we kill how can we get people

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,660
engaged how can we keep them focused on

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,560
our websites

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,080
so so the most important metrics for

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,290
that to keep in mind is at the first

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,710
content for paints so that's actually

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,480
when you first show something on the

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,000
screen that something is happening you

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:57,120
want to yeah as quickly show something

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,310
that stuff is loading up others so are

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,530
other metrics like first meaningful

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,780
things but then there is also the time

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,360
to interactive so that's actually the

00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,030
time when people can start interacting

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,400
with your websites

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:16,380
so that's what we should be optimizing

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:19,200
for so where do we start with

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,930
optimization well we can go to google

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,930
and type in how to optimize my websites

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,540
we will get millions of results and I I

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,800
think they are like thousands of yeah

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:36,270
tactics to speed up your website backend

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,770
front and sides oh you name it so I I

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:43,350
just listed here

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:46,590
yeah 10/10 performance tips yeah I don't

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,640
know hold it all the tips and tools but

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:55,530
yeah I know a lot so I just thought let

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,630
me list top 10 so we will go through

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:03,210
these four deaths I'm using my own sites

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,450
project is the Miami guys I was talking

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,280
to you know Miami is my one of my

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,550
favorite cities I go there every year

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,980
and somehow I came up with the idea to

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:18,840
create a website in WordPress and

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:23,450
started a travel guide so I go there

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:27,390
every year my social media profile and

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:30,630
yeah it's a really fun city so but I

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:33,270
know about that but the travel industry

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,270
is really competitive for the markets

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:39,690
because there are lots of travel sites

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:41,880
but one way - yeah - way from

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,720
competitors is definitely with speeds

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,720
especially in the

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,439
rival brands you see a lot of travel

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,439
websites that are really loading slow

00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:56,209
and they are like using a lot of video

00:12:52,439 --> 00:13:01,110
of course so but the first thing I do is

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:03,990
start at a measurements in lighthouse so

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,300
lighthouse is a tool that is freely

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,339
available in your browser the Google

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,110
Chrome browser

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:15,930
so I ran reports and by the time at this

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:20,120
time and I measured my sights

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:23,370
it was 6.5 seconds time to interactive

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,579
so what is nice about a lighthouse that

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,339
it gives you also some opportunities

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:33,389
that you can use to speed up your

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:37,920
websites so when you scroll down Google

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:41,550
gives you several optimization tips so

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,879
here they the first step is to defer off

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,990
screen images so off screen images is

00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,899
images that

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,600
yeah you don't see immediately above the

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,120
fold so when you visit the websites

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,670
somewhere at the bottom of your website

00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,899
that can be images that are not

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:04,829
immediately visible so by deferring off

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:07,110
screen by lazy loading deferring differ

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:10,769
of screen images you can speed up your

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:14,759
sites but one way to do that is a lazy

00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:18,870
way is to use a plugins I am currently

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:24,360
using this one and it's speeded up my

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:27,209
site 3.9 to 3.9 seconds but this was on

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,449
desktop and yeah we are in a mobile only

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:34,709
world so we need to optimize for mobile

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:36,689
well when it comes to web performance

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,480
you can start out with all kinds of

00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:42,059
tweaks but that's just like putting a

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,120
bandaid on something and most

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:50,639
importantly is to have a good hosting

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:54,210
platform so a fast loading server which

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,960
with HTTP to it was a talk that's more

00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:02,850
so talking about the offenses also for

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,480
security-wise http/2 is the hd2 is also

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,010
a lot of adventures for performance

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:13,470
loading almost they are more than two

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:18,300
times faster another thing you want to

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:20,660
do is run the latest version of PHP also

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,360
security wise its importance but

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:28,970
performance wise by using by running the

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:32,730
latest version of PHP also its

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:37,500
recommendation in for WordPress is to

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:41,190
run PHP 7 points 3 I believe I don't

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,350
know what's the latest version so that

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,529
can help you to speed up your website

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:51,180
like 3 times

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:55,080
an abling got gzip on your server so by

00:15:51,180 --> 00:16:00,750
enabling gzip you compress your files

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:03,029
and make it small but it's compressing

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:09,240
it to smaller packages so also you will

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:12,959
save lost on bandwidth and CDN so a

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:18,720
content delivery network is everybody

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:21,029
familiar here with a CDN so if you have

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,570
a website that's visited from yeah

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:27,330
multiple locations all over the world

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:29,760
people will be able to access the files

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,279
on your server much much faster because

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:39,360
they will be expensive accessing it from

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:42,440
a nearby server well tip number 6 images

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,380
well that's still yeah one of the main

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,230
quick ways to speed up your websites so

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,050
it's like the low-hanging fruits so yeah

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,959
a lot of with web pages these days are

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,550
using images so we need to make sure

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:04,750
that yeah we are using the right formats

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:09,339
right sizes yeah that they are come

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:11,980
so there is a guide by the osami he has

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,740
a whole guide on how to optimize your

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,480
your images you can basically give a

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,140
whole talk about how to optimize your

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,890
images so I really like this tool it's a

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,430
tool from Google's called squash it's a

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,280
web-based app and the app itself is like

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,250
15 kilobytes but it's really you know

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,500
compresses your images really nicely you

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,920
can select all kinds of different

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,510
formats and it's available yeah right in

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,870
your browser so you don't need any other

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:47,200
tools another way to optimize your

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:50,200
images is to use a plugin so if you work

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,290
with a lot of people like content

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,140
editors so you can install this and

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,560
automatically images will be updated

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:03,180
when they upload images to a blog post

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:08,680
so you don't have to worry anymore about

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:12,280
optimization for images well number

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:16,180
seven is a caching caching and

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,850
compression so you want to catch and

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,560
compress everything there is on your

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,820
websites so by using a plugin you can

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,000
easily what this is one of the most

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,790
popular one WP a super cache you can

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,400
cache your websites it will be also a

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:40,090
talk after my talk about web performance

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:45,460
and he will talk more in depth about

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:48,400
caching so and besides caching you want

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,370
to make sure that your codes is immersed

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,910
and minified so when you normally visit

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,070
the web page and when you go to a few

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,850
the source codes you will see a lot of

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,060
white spaces between all the codes

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:06,810
merging and minified combines your codes

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:09,070
it takes out all the white spaces and

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,620
unnecessary characters and make the

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,260
overall package a lot smaller so that

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,510
its lowest

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,510
much faster especially on mobile devices

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,340
there are plugins for every everything

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,900
on another press oh also for merging and

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,530
minifying your codes you can use

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,660
although optimized

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,790
well besides optimized by optimizing

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,490
your code oh you want to make sure that

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,040
you are serving clean coats and bike

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,710
yeah what I mean about clean code is

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,610
that you don't want to serve any code

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,180
that is not being used or unnecessary so

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:53,070
especially with plugins if you have

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,580
plugins running on your website that

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,760
you're only using for example on your

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:02,490
contact page but not on your home page

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,320
well that's yeah that's still ways that

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:09,060
you're surfing to all your pages so

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,630
there's a special plug-in called

00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:16,400
plug-in load filter and with this plugin

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:20,610
you can disable other plugins

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,610
natsu loads on specific pages so that

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,030
you only serve what is really needed on

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,030
that date

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:35,910
and well final yeah final tip is to

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,070
offer valid codes so you want to make

00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:41,280
sure that the code that's on your page

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,910
that yeah it has no errors you want to

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,580
make sure that your style sheets well

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,590
day loads in the header and that's all

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,340
your scripts are at the bottom of your

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,590
webpage so otherwise you will get these

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,700
messages from Google that you are

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,410
loading blocking resources and also you

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,260
want to check if there are no images

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:08,730
that are for a force images that are not

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:12,720
fans so you want to make sure that code

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,820
is valid it's well after all this

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,060
optimization you want to constantly

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:24,840
check yeah how what is the effect of

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:28,650
your optimization work so at the time I

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,670
checked my site downloads in three point

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:36,420
eight seconds on a mobile device so it's

00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,580
yeah quite okay you can't go for a

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,640
hundred percent but yeah I didn't

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:45,350
through set it as a goal especially on

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:52,560
mobile it's if it is below five seconds

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:54,360
it's okay so besides optimizing you want

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,210
to make sure that yeah you keep on

00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,500
monitoring it because your site is

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:04,080
really dynamic and it changes so it's

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,300
important that you monitoring how your

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,480
site is doing so there are a lot of

00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:13,230
tools for example Google search console

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,290
now also gives you alerts if several

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:19,010
pages are slowing you down

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:22,800
so you can yeah you will get notified

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:26,490
optimize them what you can also do is

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,670
set performance budgets so there's a

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:33,480
tool online that how to calculate

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:36,480
performance budgets to see how fast your

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,130
size needs to loads and then calculate

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,550
how much weight

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,690
your place needs to be and also in

00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:47,340
Google Analytics they now offer the

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,940
PageSpeed score so you have a nice

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:55,340
overview of which pages are slowing you

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:59,670
down so you can optimize them as well

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:02,430
and they even give suggestions with what

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:07,400
you need to optimize Google really helps

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:11,190
a lot - yeah make our websites faster

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,620
and how fast yeah you need to be I think

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,460
really depends on ya like your

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,440
competitors so if you want to compare if

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,840
you don't know who your competitors are
