00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,710
before we dive into the matter let's get

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,140
to know you a little bit better first

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,079

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,080
ever suffered from writer's block when

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,460
creating content for their website you

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,250
remember that feeling when you're

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,060
staring at your screen and that cursor

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,320
is blinking at you like it's laughing

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:22,860
and then when you're driving the car

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,650
those ideas oh I got it not forget about

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,479
that and then when you have the time to

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,840
take notes nothing

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:39,840
it stinks right all of you in favor of

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,649
never experiencing that again so these

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,060
are my three goals for you for today

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,930
discover some commonly make mistakes

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,689
when creating content get to know a

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,540
review some commonly used concepts and

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,540
strategies to make sure that we're all

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,180
sort of on the same page and consider

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,619
ways to take this a level up so did

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
you're creating content that resonates

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,420
with your clients and your audience and

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,179
so that it becomes much more fun and

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,970
easy

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:15,019
but first Who am I to tell you about

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,180
that well I'm in charge of marketing for

00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:21,260
level level a full-service WordPress

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,819
office right here in Rotterdam I started

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,829
a few months ago and before that I've

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,590
been a freelance digital marketer for

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:32,659
over 15 years I've been using WordPress

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:35,840
since 2007 and I love love love this

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,209
community for how encouraging it is and

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,049
for how it brings people together from

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,310
all over the world but we're not here to

00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:47,299
talk about me we're here to talk about

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,730
content so let's discuss some commonly

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,950
made mistakes

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,040
number one not planning content at all

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,230
have you ever heard of the concept if

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,349
you're failing to plan you're basically

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:05,180
setting yourself up for failure the

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,950
thing is there will always be something

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,989
more urgent there will always be

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,329
something in the daily operations of

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,190
your business that will distract you and

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,949
when you're already staring at that

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,639
white screen and nothing's coming even

00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:21,680
as hard as shake there's an additional

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:26,569
reason to just run off and do that other

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:31,040
thing and if you don't keep track of

00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:34,459
those ideas you will keep reading that

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,979
writer's block and as a result you will

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,650
not build the confidence that comes with

00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,720
creating content consistently and you

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,060
will not share that message that you

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,400
have to share and you will not encourage

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,090
those people that you're supposed to

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,879
encourage in this world so mistake

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,760
number two is not creating content for

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,650
your ideal client and I will explain the

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,220
concept of an ideal client a bit better

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,109
later on for now just remember that the

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,209
ideal client feels like your favorite

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:11,060
clients and why is it so important to

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:13,010
plan for this ideal clients well the

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,340
thing is people do business with people

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,930
and if they have the choice they'd

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,060
rather work with the people they know

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,620
like and trust so when they're come

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,240
barring service providers they're

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,850
basically trying to get the answers to

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,070
four essential questions to decide

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:35,580
whether or not there is a basis for know

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:38,580
I can trust these questions are do they

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,040
understand and empathize with the dreams

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,669
the goals and affairs and frustrations

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,620
that I have as a potential client are

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:51,330
these people qualified to get the job

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,600
done is there some sort of a click will

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,840
it be fun to work at these people and

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,940
are they basically good peeps because

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,889
what will happen if we run into a

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,820
disagreement will they disappear on me

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:09,120
will they go all the ffensive and they

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,510
will you they will use your contents to

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,220
get a first impression of all that

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:19,070
because ideally your ideal client

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,070
consumes your content when they're

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,800
trying to get to know you and ideally

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,100
when they are getting to know you're on

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,039
your website they will get that sense of

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,780
what is this writer doing in my head it

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,360
feels like they've been there and

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,780
they've done that and they probably

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,520
collected a stack of t-shirts on the way

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,460
but it also feels that they're experts

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,510
and then friendly experts and lastly

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,669
mm-hmm

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,330
I actually like their sort there there's

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:54,169
their sense of humor mistake number

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,180
three not planning for a buyers journey

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,039
people go typically throw the same steps

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,889
when they're trying to accomplish a goal

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,650
when you're trying to solve a problem in

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:08,400
an ideal world your content supports

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,550
them on their journey but if there's no

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,580
logical flow in content if there's no

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:18,389
clear calls to action or invitations for

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,550
them to get to know you better and if

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,190
there's no follow-up in a form of shape

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,650
of campaigns your audience will forget

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,600
about you and they will under they will

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,289
be on their way and they might never

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,150
come back to your website so to avoid

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,740
these mistakes in the future

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,760
let's explore some commonly known

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,460
concepts and strategies number one your

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,160
ideal client and that ideal client has

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,500
the most common characteristics of your

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,710
favorite clients in terms of

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,290
demographics so gender age group

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,110
education profession but more

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,110
importantly in terms of psychographics

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,290
like I said fears frustrations dreams

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,900
goals but also core values because I

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,930
personally think that if you're working

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,750
with a company where they're your go

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,560
your core values align it usually works

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,630
much better and if you know about these

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,910
emotions going on in the head and the

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,970
heart of your potential clients you can

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,460
tap into that by sprinkling words in

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,600
there that show them that you understand

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:31,560
them and that you're likeable an ideal

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,180
client has a need a problem that's it

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,550
like that that person likes to solve or

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,770
goal that they'd like to accomplish but

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,849
also a deadline as in some sort of

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:45,570
urgency and they thrive on the mix of

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:47,580
the personality and expertise of you if

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,150
you're a sole service provider or of

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,919
your team and lastly like I said they

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,120
follow a fairly predictable path to

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,280
purchase that path the purchase is also

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,460
called a buyers journey and this is the

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,979
most basic version of that three steps

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,490
so let's dive a little bit more into

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:11,010
what these three terms mean someone in

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,250
awareness stage has discovered a problem

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,280
and a sense of urgency for instance

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,720
their site has been hacked they're

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,320
typically trying to learn more about

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,020
that problem or about that goal in a

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,010
case of the hacked site why would

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,339
someone like my side I have nothing data

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,589
wise that they can abuse how would I

00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,669
even do that I thought I was using a

00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:41,900
security plug-in what de beep is DDoS or

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,910
a brute attack brute-force attack and

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,740
they're looking for types of options so

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,660
for instance can I clean this myself

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,200
and if I do so how much time will that

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,420
take me and how will I make sure that it

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,420
gets cleaned at all and nothing is still

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,250
there if I hire it out online on a

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,290
platform how will I know someone is

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,720
reputable or if I hire it out to an

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,780
agency is that not going to be like a

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,050
really expensive then someone in

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,720
consideration stage knows the types of

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,960
options that are available is looking to

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:21,270
find out the common pros and cons of

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:24,990
those sorts of solutions and they want

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:28,890
to know what sort of solution fits their

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,790
vision their timeline and your budget at

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,450
best and in a decision stage someone has

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,250
picked a type of solution for instance

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,820
they decide they're going to hire this

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:45,960
site cleaning out to an agency they have

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,480
created a short list of suitable service

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,510
providers and they're looking to pick

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,100
the one with the answers that are the

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,860
best match to what they're looking for

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,190
when it comes to the four questions that

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,260
I just explained do they get me dirty

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,600
empathize with me what does their

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,300
personality look like online and in

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,130
person if you're having a meeting and

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,320
are there any reviews available that

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:15,480
show evidence of all that unfortunately

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,810
this basic version of the buyers journey

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,330
has a very short term focus it's focused

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,390
on that first sell and it's a linear

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,330
model now in my opinion relationships

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,430
aren't linear it's not like we're

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,270
pulling people from point A to point B

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,280
right and some further digging led me

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,950
into a more extended model that went

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,580
past the first sale and is focused more

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,530
on keeping customers long-term and

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,480
making loyal clients so happy that they

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,110
keep referring new clients to you all

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,810
the time and they love you so much that

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,220
they will even stand up for you if they

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,100
feel like you're not treated fairly

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,310
online so let's have a look at these

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,440
additional stages

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,240
someone in retention stage that someone

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
who made a first purchase and you'd like

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,860
to like them to choose to do business

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,350
with you more often it's oftentimes

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,980
looking to make the most out of their

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:17,370
first purchase and may need content to

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,790
to get help with that they might not be

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,470
entirely happy and content that would

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,910
help them solve that problem that they

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,980
run into or easily to find page with

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,310
what they can do and whom they can reach

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,899
out to it's going to be really helpful

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,750
and they also might be interested in

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,000
purchasing add-on services if only

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,040
someone were to offer that to them and

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,339
if only someone were to explain to them

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,570
like this would be what you could do

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:51,209
next then someone in loyalty stage has

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,740
hired you more than once might be

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:57,180
willing to write a review but might not

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:03,209
think of it themselves

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:05,610
so an arch might be helpful and they

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:09,360
love to be surprised with little tokens

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:12,630
of appreciation and then last there is

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,910
advocacy stage this is the 20% of

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,510
clients that generates 80% of your

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:21,120
income not only by hiring work out to

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,949
you but also by referring those clients

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,500
all the time and they're the ones that

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,269
will that are most likely to stand up

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,360
for you if they feel you're not treated

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:36,140
fairly and this group in my opinion

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,750
needs to be spoiled rotten

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:43,140
and yet this extended version of the

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,740
buyer journey is still linear and I like

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:49,079
I said don't believe in the linearity of

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,640
healthy client relationships because

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:56,160
would that mean that they have an

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:59,570
expiration date personally I think it's

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,130
more about growing closer after all

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,980
within the internet marketing you hear a

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,949
lot about the example of dating when

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,149
people are explaining digital marketing

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,570
because it's hard to care for someone

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,030
you don't know there's a

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,220
distance but after a first pleasant

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,370
experience whether dad is a first date

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:26,890
or a first business meeting you grow

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:29,740
closer and trusts increases so how do

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,110
you take this to next level how do you

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,630
grow closer with your clients and how do

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,560
you make creating content easier and

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,250
more fun for me it helped me to turn the

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,670
linear model into a model that I call

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,350
circles of trust where your advocates

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,270
your most loyal clients live at the

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,540
center of your business because you're

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,880
closest with them and then repeat

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,940
clients come then first-time clients

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,700
then leads then people who have heard

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:04,630
about you and lastly the rest of the

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,880
world you may be thinking but if it

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,210
you're just changing the shape and

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,120
that's it well that may seem but it also

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:16,930
shifts the entire approach from pulling

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,050
and pushing to inviting people and the

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,470
circles symbolize infinity which is a

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,570
much more long-term focus and also I

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,510
think it fits much better with us work

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,330
with people because we already love

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,120
growing closer rather than pushing we

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,160
already prefer offering value rather

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,070
than pushing a deal whether someone

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,950
needs it or not and we already thrive or

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:47,320
know like and trust does that feel about

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:49,990
right and also mostly aligns with the

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,360
stages of awareness which I think are

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,420
helpful if we don't feel the need to

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,440
push or pull and the second big

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,510
difference is all about implementation

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,620
we start instead of working away from

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,350
the outside in so visitors leaves

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,690
prospects clients we start at the core

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,410
so we focus on our advocates first and

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,840
then on their loyal clients then on the

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,710
ones we'd like to retain and so on and

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,710
so forth

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:26,050
and your first focus therefore is to

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,910
make your advocates raving about you by

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,699
offering the best of what you have and

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,699
then you start creating systems to make

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,410
your clients more loyal then your

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:41,040
nurture your first some clients into

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:44,100
loyalty etc so to help you keep up with

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,480
to help you coming up with content

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,540
there's another concept I lead you to

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,209
understand and it's called pillars of

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,209
expertise what I basically call your

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,680
unique gifts to mankind

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,870
it's the fields of expertise in your

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,910
business the things you do to make your

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,370
clients lives easier let me illustrate

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,559
that with some examples if you're in a

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,420
hosting business for instance this could

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,509
be your knowledge of setting up servers

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,870
it could be about registering domains

00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:20,079
and it could be keeping websites secure

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,389
so keeping the bad guys out if you're an

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,449
agency this could be online strategy or

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:27,040
rep accessibility or your deep

00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:30,220
understanding of code that makes

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,819
websites or and that brings me to a tool

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,059
that helps you going from theory to a

00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:39,459
Content plan it's what I call the

00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:41,529
content matrix it's in the shape of a

00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,740
matrix with the little squares in

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:49,059
between where the columns represent your

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,139
pillars of expertise and arose represent

00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:55,360
the stages of awareness and each cell

00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:58,600
contains several content ideas whether

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,139
that's a blog a video or follow-up email

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,149
and each of them help your ideal client

00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,490
get a step closer to solving that

00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:10,329
problem or accomplishing that goal and

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:13,829
each of them has a call to action to

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:20,169
invite them to come closer but always

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:20,890
starting at the core it could look like

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,620
this

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:27,490
you could recreate this as a table in

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:29,530
any sort of word processing document I'd

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,210
like to recommend you to treat a

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,960
document like this as an organic

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,260
document

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,470
so start one jot down some ideas then a

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:41,289
few days later go back to it add some

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,600
ideas and on the way if you think about

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:48,309
something make a note in your phone and

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,919
then add it again and if you were to

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,770
create like three pieces of content for

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,710
each little square before you know it

00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,570
you'll have outlines for up to 50 or

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,000
even over 50 pieces of content and don't

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,029
forget to add a call to action because

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,059
people may love your content but if you

00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:13,149
don't ask them friendly invitingly to

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,649
take a next step they may find that

00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:18,399
distraction they will be on their way

00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:19,899
again and mix it up a variety of content

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,490
there's people that prefer to read

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,710
there's people that prefer to listen

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:29,289
there's people that prefer to watch

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:31,990
videos this could be an example of one

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:36,279
of those content ideas so say for

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,590
instance we are organizing and VIP day

00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,600
for our very best clients and we need a

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,010
landing page we need to follow up and we

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,440
need to work on the content for that day

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,860
the content outlines could be and this

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,149
would be a long long form shape

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,600
long-form content because it would be a

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:59,020
talk we could write about five ways to

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,490
improve accessibility to boost ROI we

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,340
could add some metrics

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,980
that you could help keep track and we

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:11,440
could explain some steps to get there

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:13,630
and the call to action for them for the

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,850
email the landing page would be hey

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,120
bring a friend we'd love to meet some

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:24,130
people who are also interested in this

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:27,190
topic so having seen an example let's

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,200
have a look at the stages of awareness

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:33,940
again where we'll discuss some ideas of

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,770
content to create in advocacy stage your

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,990
goal is to keep the people happy so

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:43,389
happy that they will continue to share

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,789
their happiness and get referrals for

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,429
you right one of the ideas I just

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,619
gave it as an example could be customer

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:52,749
appreciation days but you could also

00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,279
bring a group of people within the same

00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:56,979
industry together to organize a

00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,259
mastermind about a topic within the

00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:02,739
industry or something we all struggle

00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:07,929
with then another idea could be to

00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:09,879
create premium content and for instance

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:11,529
if you're doing research yourself you

00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:14,289
could share that with this group first

00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,489
and then later on after having given

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:19,169
them a head start

00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:22,029
start rolling that out to other stages

00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:26,769
and like I said bringing a friend is an

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:28,690
awesome way for for advocate clients

00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:31,210
because they are already very happy

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,700
about you and they know people in the

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:37,929
same industry so it's something that

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:41,080
really works also collaborate with these

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:43,529
people if you are creating new products

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,879
invite them in have a panel discussion

00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:48,759
discover what their struggles are and

00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:52,059
how you can solve those but also if you

00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,940
are about to learn launch Minimum Viable

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,309
products have them in and test it for

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,169
you because they're most likely to be

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,149
honest with you because they will have

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:04,960
the benefits of a product that works

00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:08,289
better as well and always when you're

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,289
planning contents keep in mind how you

00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:13,059
can keep repurposing it because you're

00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,099
spending a lot of time on creating

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:19,419
content so you may as well squeeze the

00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:22,929
most buck buck for your hour then people

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:25,149
in advocacy stage I will recommend to

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,489
share that premium content that best

00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:29,139
research with them second and you

00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:31,570
instead of bringing them in you could

00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:34,389
for instance do a webinar or create a

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,970
special edition website a white paper

00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:39,909
for just that group you could co-create

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,190
contents like case studies happy clients

00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:44,979
love to be featured in case studies and

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,129
customer profiles and when there's still

00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:50,559
any excitement of having that that case

00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:52,179
study published that is the perfect

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,039
moment to ask them for a review because

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:56,950
they're still on that very positive flow

00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,150
and are most likely to create something

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,660
awesome

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,070
then people are loyal east age your goal

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,170
there is to increase customer

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,750
satisfaction and one of the ways to do

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,809
that is an onboarding strategy for

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,520
instance an email serie where you share

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:19,070
in the vision behind your company the

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,470
backstory of your brand but also some

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,309
key contact persons to reach out to if

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,410
they're not feeling happy a group like

00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,570
that I'm going to fast a group like that

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,120
you are you could give little

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,220
assignments ask them to do things are we

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,429
already connected on social media we

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,080
would love to connect with you there

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,850
read this blog post because most of our

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,140
customers are raving about it could help

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:47,390
you too and by having them do that

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,370
following up on your suggestions they're

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:55,160
starting to see you more and more as an

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,840
expert last also customer service

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,790
content is something that is really

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,370
helpful not only for your existing

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:04,160
clients but also for people that are

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,870
using similar services and are not happy

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,940
with the customer service at their

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,770
service provider so for instance if

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,650
you're a hosting company and someone

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,000
struggles with a domain that all of a

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,059
sudden doesn't do the thing that it

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,700
needs to do and your content helps them

00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,230
solve that by the time they're up for

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,460
renewal for the domain name and they're

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,840
still not happy with that

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:30,830
other register where do you think

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:33,500
they'll go and this group thrives on

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,870
well this group may be open for an

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,480
upgrade but you may need to offer that

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,460
on the right time for instance if you're

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,040
selling self-study courses you could

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,250
send an email out automatically after

00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,740
two weeks asking them how they are doing

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,040
and by the way if they were to be

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,990
struggling you also help you also offer

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,350
one-on-one coaching and if you're

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,929
launching a site after your guarantee

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:03,410
warranty period you could offer them a

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:06,650
maintenance program then people in this

00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:10,480
Asian stage you're trying to nurture

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,480
them into making that first purchase

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,000
what you're trying to do here is help

00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,970
tough customer find their best fits

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,019
because we are not the best fit for

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:26,140
everyone and if you're working with

00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:29,019
people that you're that where you don't

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:32,409
communicate well it takes so much energy

00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:34,450
so make sure that your your content

00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:39,490
reflects your personality and your

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:42,760
expertise you could use content that

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,850
helps them set priorities and compare

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,820
products this is the group that loves to

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,380
read case studies to see what sort of

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,480
brands you already worked with and how

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,799
you worked and what people actually said

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,350
about how that they experienced that and

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,820
if you'd like to convince people to do

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,000
business with you and they're still in

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,639
that moment where they're in doubt scar

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,360
City based offers really work work like

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:13,899
discount vouchers or bonuses with an

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,230
expiry moment people in consideration

00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:19,870
stage need to be persuaded to pick the

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,269
category that's yours for this group I

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,149
think pillar content the content that is

00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:28,389
long-form and focused on keywords works

00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,860
really well because you already they

00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:31,840
already have gotten to know you a little

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,710
bit so they're more willing to spend

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,940
time with you long how-to articles with

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:42,549
extended steps and lots of examples and

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,980
the longer firm lead magnets that they

00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:48,940
will need to sign up for before they get

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,679
access to it white papers webinars these

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,279
people are looking for more information

00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,620
for more in-depth information and then

00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,929
lastly people in awareness stage they

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,760
don't know you all that well so they're

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:03,039
maybe not willing to spend that much

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,960
time and attention with you what you

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,230
could do is create content that is

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,039
shortened to the point content that

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,960
explains some of the whys and how's some

00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:19,149
of the mistakes that they can make some

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,850
of the lingo of the field also content

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:23,490
that raises awareness so what could

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,200
happen if you don't act at all

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,809
if you don't clean out clean up that hex

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,390
I'd what if you do business with the

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:35,940
wrong people and not only on your

00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,980
website but also in social media and

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,460
what we see often is that people use

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:44,940
their social media to post this is my

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,340
article come visit and people may not

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,520
click on it but if you instead you post

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,530
snippets of valuable information without

00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,320
clicking they still get to know some of

00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,429
your personality and expertise so keep

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,330
that in mind when you're creating

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,550
content so these were my three goals for

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:07,470
you for today discover some commonly

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:10,890
made mistakes get to know some concepts

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,770
and strategies and learn ways to take

00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:16,110
this a step up I hope I delivered on my

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:20,840
promise and I'd love to hear your main

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,840
takeaways and any questions I can answer

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:29,619
