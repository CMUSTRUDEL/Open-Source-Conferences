Description: 
	“The practice of branding can be traced back to 50.000 years ago. The concept of marketing branding to 4000 BC. And with the (r)evolution brought forth by the Internet and Social Media, today “we are all brands” and as such, we all need to be aware of how a brand is best managed. 
This talk is a primer on the origin and the evolution of the concept of branding, so to better understand and care for our brand(s), regardless of their being a company, a product or a personal one. It covers 3 aspects of the branding practice: clarification on terminology, a historical overview to frame the culture, and a “branding recipe” section to highlight the process and the key aspects of quality branding.”
