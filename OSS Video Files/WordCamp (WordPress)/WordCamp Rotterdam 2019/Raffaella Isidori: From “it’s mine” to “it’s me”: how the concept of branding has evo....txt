Publication date: 2019-06-05
Playlist: WordCamp Rotterdam 2019
Description: 
	“The practice of branding can be traced back to 50.000 years ago. The concept of marketing branding to 4000 BC. And with the (r)evolution brought forth by the Internet and Social Media, today “we are all brands” and as such, we all need to be aware of how a brand is best managed. 
This talk is a primer on the origin and the evolution of the concept of branding, so to better understand and care for our brand(s), regardless of their being a company, a product or a personal one. It covers 3 aspects of the branding practice: clarification on terminology, a historical overview to frame the culture, and a “branding recipe” section to highlight the process and the key aspects of quality branding.”

know that tell me later so let's get

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,549
going

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,830
I need to look at my slides otherwise

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,799
this is gonna be stand-up comedy for two

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,000
hours so I wanna get three points across

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,810
to you today

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,799
first thing what a brand is and what a

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,259
brand is not the second thing is gonna

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,070
be how we got to what today we call

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,470
branding which it's you know it's a long

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,689
story and then I'm gonna share with you

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,799
my recipe as a brand designer to create

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,390
or to strengthen your own brands and

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,490
since we're having a hackathon and we're

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,659
working with no profits I've added a

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,579
specific little bit dedicated to that so

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:57,630
let's go

00:01:49,579 --> 00:02:02,250
so how many of you few are here know

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:06,119
what the term brands refers to or think

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,209
they do show hands show hands don't be

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,940
shy they see me not you well not a lot

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,490
of you that's okay that's good

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,650
so according to the American Marketing

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,010
Association dictionary which we're gonna

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,730
take as like the Bible a brand is a name

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:29,070
term designed symbol or any other future

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:32,910
feature so the overall experience that

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:37,740
identifies one sellers good or service

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:43,130
as distinct from those of other sellers

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:46,650
of goods or services so what is often

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:55,530
improperly pet peeve referred to as a

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:59,970
brand this is not a brand a logo is not

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,460
a brand how many of you

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,040
you can fess up you know how many of you

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,750
have used the term brand to refer to a

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:13,370
logo or vice versa

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,990
okay okay be brave okay so they're not a

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,660
brand is not a logo and a logo is not a

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,550
brand and I'm gonna show you exactly

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,550
what I mean so what is this

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,120
but what who is this okay let me

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,610
rephrase that

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:36,510
that's Nike right that's Nike the

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,150
attitude the vision the style this is

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,730
Nikes declared mission to bring

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,310
inspiration and innovation to every

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,830
athlete in the world in the world and

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,640
then there's an asterisk that says if

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:54,120
you have a body you are an athlete so

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,340
this is Nike's logo but this is Nikes

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:03,890
brand let me show you another example

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,890
who knows what this symbol stands for

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:12,900
right so this is a logo but this is the

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,000
New Zealand's All Blacks brand right the

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,130
haka and the fact that you don't want to

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,890
meet them pissed off at night also kind

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:24,120
of so a logo is the representation it's

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,760
an icon

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,449
it's a symbol of a set of intangible

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,380
values that set a company or a service

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:37,260
or a person apart from somebody else and

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:43,440
the brand is that set of intangible

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:47,930
values the emotions the vibe the hate

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,729
the like that is like the what you feel

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,790
so to borrow from Ann Handley who

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:56,789
borrowed from zefrank the brand is the

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,400
emotional aftertaste that comes after an

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:04,680
experience with a product or a service

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,070
or a company a person or an entity so

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,380
you can think of the logo as the

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,810
two-dimensional representation of a

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,770
multi-dimensional experience which is

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:23,070
the brand so every single one of these

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:25,650
marks can evoke feelings maybe bad ones

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,800
in which case you might want to work on

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,280
your brand but still you know they are

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,000
an icon of something that is much more

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,750
deeper and important and valuable so how

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,750
did we get here

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:46,560
the first practice of branding can be

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,840
traced back to 50,000 years ago its

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,830
purpose rather obviously was to

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:57,680
establish what belonged to whom so paint

00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:00,840
paintings in the Lascaux caves in the

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,960
South of France which are the oldest

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,990
that we have found suggest that early

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,120
man might have marked cattle and

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,539
utensils with symbols drawn in paint or

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,849
tar so all properties that were

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:20,520
considered precious were branded with

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:23,250
the marking of the owner by 2700 BC

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,840
owners switch to a more permanent method

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:30,210
burning in fact the term branding comes

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,260
from the Norse the Old Norse term

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,409
Brander which means to burn and the

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,509
oldest documented practice of how

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:42,179
of hot iron branding is found in

00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:48,029
Egyptian funeral documents and monuments

00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:50,939
that date back to 5,000 years ago so

00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:54,239
then we have an established ownership

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:58,469
now the next thing that branding did was

00:06:54,239 --> 00:07:01,229
to establish a products origin branding

00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:04,319
good a bit like labels transfer the

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,809
information as to who where and to which

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,879
with which materials some goods were

00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:14,699
made and we can consider this the

00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,729
closest application to the term of what

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:22,139
we mean today and the notion of brand as

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:26,249
reputation this practice was worldwide

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:31,349
spread there's traces in India Greece

00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:36,239
Rome Mesopotamia and China some of the

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:38,719
earliest smart pottery dates back more

00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:44,519
than 5,000 years I thought it was

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:47,249
oversized and I love this archaeologists

00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:50,339
have identified about 1,000 unique

00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:52,919
Potter's marks that was that were used

00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,679
during the first three centuries of the

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,829
Roman Empire which means that there was

00:07:55,679 --> 00:08:01,050
about a thousand shops and I can imagine

00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:04,110
people going who you know I just bought

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,679
this from Mario's FICO's you know and I

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:11,719
think he's so much better than Tito's

00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:15,860
Pateros whatever and I you know this is

00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:19,199
2,000 years ago this is quite cool so

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,989
moving forward in the Middle Ages

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,079
guilds began using marks to distinguish

00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:28,259
their products and property so paper

00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,769
makers and printing houses used

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,839
watermarks like this and stonemasons and

00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:38,849
quarries developed an elaborate system

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:42,419
to identify their work artists had

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,819
always used symbols to identify their

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,790
work but in the Renaissance artists like

00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:49,450
Michelangelo rather than use symbols

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,490
started saying

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,139
I want to put my name on it I want to

00:08:51,490 --> 00:09:01,240
make sure that people know I made that

00:08:53,139 --> 00:09:04,959
and so he this is in the Pieta in Rome

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,990
and this act introduced a new type of

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,279
branding which was authorship and the

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,649
first notion of personal branding fast

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,529
forward to the 1800s and the Industrial

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:22,029
Revolution mass production of generic

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:24,339
goods meant that these products which

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,100
were all basically the same needed to be

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,880
distinguished because they were all

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,250
basically alike so the first attempt at

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,339
doing that was through the crates that

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,120
were used to transport which were odd

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,910
hiren branded and they were soon

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,350
followed by the personalization of the

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:51,310
products container itself in the early

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:54,670
1900's in fact we start seeing the birth

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,399
of what we today call packaging design

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,300
and also of the mother concept of

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,390
branding so by the late 18-hundreds

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,970
on a legal side companies had began

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,360
investing a lot in branding and started

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,279
recognizing its intrinsic value so they

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,390
demanded a way to protect those

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:20,230
investments from competitors so in 1862

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,750
the merchandise marks Act made it a

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:26,980
criminal offence to imitate another

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:32,319
trademark with intent to defraud or to

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:35,199
enable another to the fraud and in 1875

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,230
the trademark registration Act allowed

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:46,959
formal registration of trademarks in the

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:50,230
UK so now a mark was or logo became a

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,949
valuable asset and a brand became

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,179
something that you could sell own and

00:10:53,949 --> 00:11:00,910
sell and transfer

00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:04,509
so many new brands entering the market

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,850
and so many parity products companies

00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,949
needed to you know further differentiate

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,670
and convince people that their product

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:15,309
was better than their competitors

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,519
that's where advertising comes in in the

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:20,429
early 1900 advertising it was relatively

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,829
new and underused

00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:28,899
but a man named James Walter Thompson

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:31,149
had a farsighted vision his advertising

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,819
agency was the first one to establish a

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:38,470
creative Department to design content

00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:41,739
for clients and he had a clear vision so

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,589
to support that and to sell the concept

00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:46,779
of advertising to clients he wrote two

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,730
books he was in a really great

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,189
copywriter because he called them the

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,860
red and blue Thompson books of

00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:59,889
advertising which is not exactly you

00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:03,009
know but in them there were two guides

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:09,610
dedicated to clients that explained the

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:11,619
values of creating a brand in them he

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,350
also introduced the concept of trade at

00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:16,389
trademark advertising which is basically

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,040
an early definition of what today we

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:26,439
call branding obviously advertising

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:29,019
needs a medium to be carried by so it's

00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:31,439
evolution follows tightly that of the

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:34,329
available communication technology

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:36,610
so the first advertising budgets were

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:40,110
spent on newspapers ads and radio spots

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:43,869
and between the 40s and the 50s

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,559
television became the game changer let's

00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:46,559
see if this is gonna work

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:57,130
America runs on bull of a time creating

00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,100
right so this was the first ever TV

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:08,770
commercial aired it lasted nine seconds

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:11,350
it was 1941 by 1952 TV ad revenue

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:16,330
surpassed magazine and radio ad sales

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:18,190
combined bringing in you know the Golden

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,530
Age of advertising which was made

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,940
popular by Mad Men in the 1560s

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,370
advertising evolves from a unique

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,700
selling proposition to an emotional

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,880
selling proposition in the 50s the

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,760
product is the core differential so all

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,510
advertising needs to communicate is that

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,720
it exists and what you can use it for hi

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:48,400
I'm a toothpaste you can you know brush

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:52,420
your teeth and have nice teeth but with

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,500
so many parity products the practice

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:59,700
evolved to a further way to

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:05,050
differentiate which is an emotional

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:07,930
selling proposition and so the messaging

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,990
becomes emotional in an effort to give

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:16,390
products a personality but also to pull

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:19,360
the emotional strings of the consumer in

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,120
the 70s and 80s we see the rise of mass

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,700
media communication and the integration

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,760
of all media in the budgets so

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:34,540
advertising is done through TV magazine

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:37,080
radio and billboards in the 70s TV sets

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,400
are now common they permeate society

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,710
consumers have become very brand

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:48,430
conscious friends have become a status

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:50,740
symbol and by the 80s the formula for

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,470
winning is clear a good campaign and

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:58,360
massive spending on all available media

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,600
an example of an excellent advertising

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,269
campaign is the mall Berman

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,910
first conceived by Leo Burnett in 1954

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,550
as a way to popularize filtered

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,790
cigarettes to men which at the time were

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:17,970
considered feminine the campaign ray ran

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:19,790
from 1954 to 1999 it is considered one

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,000
of the most brilliant advertising

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:28,319
campaigns of all times it transformed a

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,170
mile ladies cigarette into a rough ultra

00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:35,790
masculine accessory in a matter of

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:39,170
months Marlboro sales increased 300% in

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:44,339
the two years after the add the buted in

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:48,480
1955 and the Marlboro Man did that

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:51,779
through the simple insight that a person

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,250
cigarette could could speak to his or

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,250
her self-image

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:10,069
now mind you please listen to what the

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,069
to the colleague to text

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:18,260
you don't see many wild stallions

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:21,040
anymore it gets better

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,040
it gets better

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,520
no you don't see many wild stallions

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,070
anymore and even if he did run all three

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,130
of your best mares he's one of the last

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,130
over wild and very singular breed

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:56,390
come to where the flavor is come to

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,390
Marlboro country

00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:09,350
no innuendo non-0 okay we can okay no

00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:15,319
that's backward no we're not listening

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:17,959
to this again okay so between the 80s

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,199
and the 90s companies began to cultivate

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:25,370
the company brand focusing on corporate

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,940
identity vision and value so the company

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:31,460
behind the product became the brand that

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,389
they wanted people to become

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,909
familiarized with now in the 1920s and

00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:40,309
between the 1920s and the 2010 we

00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:43,279
witnessed the digital revolution by the

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:46,120
end of the 1990s Internet is widely

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:49,519
available at least in Western countries

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,730
and in little over two decades our

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:56,029
entire way of communicated and

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,269
interacting has completely changed in

00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:02,059
terms of branding this has had two major

00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:05,510
implication the first one is that we are

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:09,679
all brands now we're all given a voice a

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,960
look and feel a public persona through

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,510
internet and social media we can all

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,659
become references and beacons we all

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:21,639
have access to a potential instantaneous

00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:24,440
limelight but we are also open to

00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:28,269
unprecedented and unruly scrutiny and

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,730
judgment and trolling and bullying and

00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:33,950
less privacy which used to be only a

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,690
famous people problem I mean no

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,710
paparazzi were hanging out of my house

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,539
you know 30 years ago none are doing

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,649
that now you know I had a stalker once

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:48,620
but that's another talk so now we can

00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:53,240
all kind of you know we're only a tweet

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,639
away to become influencers though we all

00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,710
want to become influencers now no but

00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:04,299
many kids do I can understand why the

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,430
second thing that has changed is that

00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:08,640
information

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:11,610
is out there people are watching and you

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,000
simply can't tie it anywhere any one of

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,700
you remember an old gentleman being

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,300
dragged off you know a Delta airline a

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,770
couple years ago how quickly that went

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:28,410
around how poorly it did for the company

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,800
so blunders are bigger because the world

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:34,830
is watching and recording and the news

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,500
isn't aeneas so brands need to stay

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,400
alert and on top of things to avoid

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,190
scandals

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,670
which are a loss of equity remember the

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,160
value and they need to manage the

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:51,600
reputation much more than they had to

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,330
the for so branding has evolved it went

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,150
from establishing ownership to certify

00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,090
origin quality and authorship to

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,340
distinguish one product from another to

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,360
differentiate products that were alike

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,990
through emotions to turning a brand into

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:15,480
a company asset that has value to imply

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:19,310
status and to represent reputation so

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,760
what's today today your brand is your

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:26,760
captors to your customer it's an

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,160
exercise in trust building and in clear

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,250
communication and to put it with Jeff

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,200
basis your brand is what other people

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:41,190
say about you when you're not in the

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:45,050
room so this is great right this is big

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:49,350
company marketing offices what about us

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:52,470
you know freelancers small folks small

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:56,760
companies startups should we care about

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,360
our branding yes absolutely

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,340
because of all this stuff I said before

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:07,110
so let me show you let me give you a

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:10,230
little how-to and mind you this is a

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:15,690
blueprint to a brand not a logo although

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:16,730
some things apply first you have to know

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,220
yourself

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,120
it's hard to tell others what would you

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,010
do if it's not really clear to you you

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:30,320
need to know who your customer is and

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:34,870
what value you provide for them you need

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,870
to know which pond you're swimming in

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:42,850
you need to know what your competition

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:47,390
is doing and also understand what what

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:51,140
differentiate you from them you need to

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:54,110
have a vision your goals your purpose

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,920
where you want to go it's like a map you

00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:02,590
need that you need to follow and you

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,270
have to have values now more than ever

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,520
partially because the world watches and

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,950
records and will remember and partially

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,250
because it's really not nice if you

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:16,360
don't you get to be like Mark Zuckerberg

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:21,400
and you know that's I mean it has

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:24,710
advantages but you have to have a plan

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:29,210
this is like an intentional road trip so

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,310
you can't hack it you need to give your

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,250
brand an appropriate personality and

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:37,310
it's only now in the process that you

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,650
get to work on your logo and you can

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,400
convey your brand personality through

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,280
graphic design and now we talk logo and

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,560
symbol and colors and the key here is

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,350
consistency

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,660
and then you can use messages the tone

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,370
tone of voice and type of language and

00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:00,890
here you need to be coherent

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,740
communication how we're in which way you

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,530
communicate with your audience and the

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,620
key here is competence because it's not

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:14,630
something that you just know you need to

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:18,050
study and know about it the attitude

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:21,190
that you have with and towards your

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:24,260
customer and the key here it's service

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:28,810
and while there's no need for big

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,810
budgets you do need to invest something

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:35,760
like all valuable stuff you need to work

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:39,840
on it adjusted it's necessary and keep

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:44,480
working lastly and though it's not

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,460
mandatory but it's like the ethics thing

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,040
it's nice if you can do this mindfully

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,170
you know if you are aware of you know

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:56,340
who you are but also who's around you

00:23:52,170 --> 00:24:00,120
and what surrounds you your people so be

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:03,180
present and be mindful now what if you

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,510
are a personal brand steps one through
