Description: 
	How do you teach a computer to design a website?
I’ve spent the last year trying to automate my own job. I’ll tell you why that’s not such a bad thing, and how to actually go about doing it.
We’ll investigate how automation isn’t all that different from other technological leaps of the past—as well as ways in which it is vastly different. We’ll touch on how emerging technologies can be an equaliser and the real-world application of machine learning.
Along the way, we’ll talk about ethics, universal basic income, and how soon Judgement Day will be upon us.
Finally, we’ll touch on how Gutenberg opens up new possibilities within the WordPress space, and how to take advantage of those opportunities.
