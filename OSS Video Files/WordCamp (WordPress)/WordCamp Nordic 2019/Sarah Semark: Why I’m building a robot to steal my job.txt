Title: Sarah Semark: Why I’m building a robot to steal my job
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	How do you teach a computer to design a website?
I’ve spent the last year trying to automate my own job. I’ll tell you why that’s not such a bad thing, and how to actually go about doing it.
We’ll investigate how automation isn’t all that different from other technological leaps of the past—as well as ways in which it is vastly different. We’ll touch on how emerging technologies can be an equaliser and the real-world application of machine learning.
Along the way, we’ll talk about ethics, universal basic income, and how soon Judgement Day will be upon us.
Finally, we’ll touch on how Gutenberg opens up new possibilities within the WordPress space, and how to take advantage of those opportunities.

my clicker is not working noted all

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:13,650
right hi this is Brian Cheers

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,740
people love to imagine the future what

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,380
will it look like well we have cars that

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,920
run on electricity or even drive

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,439
themselves or huge warehouses staffed

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,150
only by robots

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,330
maybe wristwatches so you can use for

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,940
communication or entertainment or a

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,050
global job market enabled by instant

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,540
worldwide video communication we may not

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,510
yet have jetpacks robot Butler's or

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,820
flying cars but in many ways we are

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,579
already living in the techno futuristic

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,600
utopia envisioned by futurists in the

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,600
50s we ask tiny machines living in our

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,399
kitchen what the weather is like we have

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,140
super computers in our pockets that

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,230
allow us immediate access to any

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,080
information we have fridges that order

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,090
more milk when we run out and you can go

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,260
to youtube right now and see prototypes

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,530
of new airships and flying cars in case

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,640
you were worried they look hilarious

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:20,100
isn't the future glorious it's also

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,220
exciting that we don't tend to think

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,100
that much about what could go wrong are

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,070
we building Skynet is how plotting

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,430
against us are the robots coming to

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,090
steal our jobs the answer to that last

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:40,790
question is yeah probably an oxford

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:44,159
university report of 2017 estimates by

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,340
2055 half of all current jobs will be

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,200
automated now it's worth noting that

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,220
we're really really bad at predicting

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,360
the future futurists in 58 predicted

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,450
that we would have a chess-playing

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,899
computer by 1968 and that actually took

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,149
us 40 years and this oft-quoted

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,240
study about half of all jobs being

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,550
automated actually has a 20-year margin

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,209
of error which means it could be really

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,569
really soon

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,810
or it could be age

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:17,260
but either way this is a problem that we

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,840
need to start thinking about now the

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,700
thing is we've always been terrified

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,819
that automation is going to come and

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,769
take our jobs the term technological

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,439
unemployment to refer to the loss of

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:32,049
jobs by technological change was coined

00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,290
in 1930s by the economist John Maynard

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:38,530
Keynes but it's a problem that's as old

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,200
as the wheel Public Works and hand out

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,470
programs of ancient China Egypt Greece

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,829
and Rome were all responses to fears of

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,930
technological unemployment Aristotle

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,269
said that if machines can become

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,359
sufficiently advanced we would have no

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,970
need for human labor and this fear has

00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:01,269
often resulted in outright bans on

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,639
technological innovation Queen Elizabeth

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,230
and James the first both refused to

00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,120
issue a patent for a time-saving

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,310
knipfing machine for fear that this

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,939
technology might cause unemployment

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,699
amongst textile workers speaking of

00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:20,919
textile workers who here has heard the

00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:22,900
term Luddite okay so a Luddite is

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,239
somebody who opposes technological

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,430
change or isn't comfortable with it if

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,470
you know somebody who thinks iPhones are

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,919
newfangled devices and refuses to touch

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,090
one that is a Luddite the term is

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,340
actually derived from a secret

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,099
organization of English textile workers

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,049
in the nineteenth century they were

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,000
afraid of these new machines that would

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,099
put them out of work and in response

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,430
they went around smashing textile

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:51,069
machines as a form of protest this was

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,409
such a problem at the time that there

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,060
were more British soldiers fighting the

00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:58,199
Luddites in Britain than there were

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,090
fighting Napoleon in the iberian war

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,150
eventually Parliament made machine

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,220
braking a capital crime and one of the

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,220
most prominent defenders of the Luddites

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,859
was actually Lord Byron whose daughter

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,500
Ada Lovelace would go on to become the

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,570
world's first computer programmer by

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,370
combining the technology of Babbitt

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,550
Babbage's analytical engine

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,980
with a system to give programs and dates

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,169
the machine that was actually based on

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,110
the punch card system of the jacquard

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:33,199
loom so innovations in the textile

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,600
industry in spite of it being so against

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,220
innovations actually had a direct

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,570
correlation to the invention of what

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,680
would eventually become the modern

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:45,979
computer when Gutenberg inverse invent

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,830
introduced the printing press in 1450 -

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:51,590
so the first one it provoked complaints

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,200
about German interlopers driving honest

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,190
Italian scribes out of work and there

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,300
were protests in Paris but it also

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,720
revolutionised the publishing industry

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,400
across Europe it led to an explosion and

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,130
literacy and a flourishing of the Arts

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,030
which ultimately led to a number of new

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:14,300
jobs over the years we've largely

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:20,260
replaced a whole lot of jobs switchboard

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:25,280
operators travel agents stockbrokers

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,930
checkout clerks grocery clerks pilots

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,030
are still employed but most of their

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,370
work tends to be done by autopilot

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,120
algorithms and their job has become more

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,330
supervisory bank tellers have often been

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,729
replaced by automated machines the

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,310
average bank now only employs 13 people

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,560
instead of 20 but with the advent of

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,599
these machines the bank's passed those

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,700
cost savings along and actually opened

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,810
more banks and now there are more bank

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:57,020
tellers employees we think of computers

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,910
as plastic boxes and machines but the

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,780
original computers were actually humans

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,880
and mostly women a computer just meant

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,150
somebody who computes mathematical

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,250
tables for scientific actuarial or

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,460
military work and this work was

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,169
considered quite ruling and come

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:20,030
performs by humans until the advent of

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:22,930
electrical computers in spite of all

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:26,539
these changes our economy has improved

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,130
consistently over the years we see that

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,470
this has happened over and over again

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,560
and we've been fine

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:37,520
we've been better we work less and we

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:44,240
enjoy a higher quality of life so what

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:47,330
makes it different this time the first

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,010
reason is scale the number of jobs that

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,800
we expect to be automated in the future

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,890
is staggeringly high there's that 50%

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,290
number again and it's not isolated to

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:02,990
one specific industry it runs across the

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:06,170
gamut it's often not the tasks that you

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,170
expect as well and this is known as more

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,990
of AX paradox the things that are easy

00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,450
for a toddler to do like climbing stairs

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,330
or reading emotions are actually really

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,670
difficult for computers to do but the

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,250
stuff that we find difficult to do like

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,690
logic is incredibly easy for a computer

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:30,440
to do there's a website it is will

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:34,430
robots take my job com where you can

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,130
find out how at risk you are as a

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,010
general rule right now it's a more

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,450
procedural and systematic your job the

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,100
more you should start looking for

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,580
something else so if you're into data

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,550
entry telemarketing or tax preparation

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,770
learn a new skill if however you are a

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,440
social worker and occupational therapist

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,320
or surgeon it's cool you don't need to

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,419
worry

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,310
surveys generally find that people are

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,560
concerned about technological and

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,410
unemployment but they don't think it

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,380
will affect them and we've often assumed

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,630
that certain jobs are safe I'm a

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,720
designer I do creative work there's no

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,910
way a machine could do that that was

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,160
true for a while when a eyes were

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,520
largely algorithmic and needed to follow

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,070
rules but advances in machine learning

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,860
which combines pattern recognition with

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,169
massive amounts of data mean that

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,870
computers can now do a lot of tasks we

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,300
thought they'd never be able to do they

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,510
can beat humans at chess at go and at

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,630
jeopardy they can write books this one

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,690
nearly won a Japanese literary award but

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,829
its characterization was

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,019
men they've composed music convincingly

00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:53,379
enough to pass the Turing test and trick

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:55,660
humans a computer even wrote a stage

00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:59,050
musical that was produced on London's

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,620
West End and it was called Android Lloyd

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:06,670
Webber so it's clear that we aren't safe

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,170
just because our jobs are creative the

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,500
other reason that it's different this

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,089
time

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:17,199
is speed it's all happening incredibly

00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:21,040
quickly technological progress is more

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:27,100
or less exponential who's heard of

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,600
Moore's Law Wow okay well this is

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,430
Moore's law but you all already know

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,370
that

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:39,970
basically it was a rule set up in 1965

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:43,089
by the founder of Intel George R Gordon

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,490
Moore so many more basically saying that

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,980
computing power would double every two

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,310
years he predicted that that law would

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,810
hold true for around ten years but it's

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,850
been consistent for the last fifty one

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,889
small note these look like linear graphs

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,839
but they're actually logarithmic which

00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,759
means that this rather than being a

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,939
straight line is actually an exponential

00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,860
curve which is boring graph stuff that

00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,850
basically just means there's a potential

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,160
here for uncontrollable growth and that

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,439
what has come before isn't a reliable

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,769
indicator of what will come next or the

00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:24,959
speed at which it will happen the flip

00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,860
side of this is for the increase in

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,230
computing power we also see a

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,230
corresponding decrease in the cost of

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,000
products as more work is done by

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,110
machines the cost of those goods

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,149
decreases and we can afford more so

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,579
these lower prices theoretically mean

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,329
that companies can hire more humans for

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,610
other human work just like banks hired

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:52,990
more humans in more

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,520
bank buildings we also have new

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,710
innovations that are enabled by new

00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:01,030
technologies and those lead to more jobs

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,850
ultimately there's always going to be

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,860
more work imagine if somebody gave you a

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,500
robot tomorrow that could do all of the

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,830
boring parts of your job would you still

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,900
have things to do maybe you could focus

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,220
on the things that humans are better at

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:22,810
like caring or innovation or playing

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:25,270
Angry Birds the trouble is that our

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,570
economy isn't currently well structured

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,220
for human beings corporations are

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,140
incentivized to maximize shareholder

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,400
returns not necessarily to make a profit

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,560
which means that wealth is accumulated

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,940
for a small number of people and it

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,530
isn't evenly distributed Millennials are

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,840
the first generation we expect to be

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,340
worse off than their parents and the gap

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,010
between the rich and the poor is ever

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,360
widening now this gap actually tends

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,940
feel it's smaller in the Nordic

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,070
countries and who coincidentally also

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,890
worry less about automation and tend to

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,770
be happier across the board but that gap

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,780
is actually increasing faster in Finland

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,990
Sweden and Germany than it is in the

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:12,880
u.s. so this gap is a global problem

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,260
what can we do to ensure that these

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,020
changes to our economy

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,900
don't disenfranchise swathes of the

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:27,730
population and contribute further to

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:30,040
global inequality how about or maybe we

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,100
often talk about market forces as though

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,850
they are inescapable like tides or

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,940
gravity but we invented them so we can

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,460
change the rules we need to push

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,580
politicians for policy change so we can

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,520
work within these new systems this could

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,330
take a number of different forms we

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,820
could just work less in 1870 we used to

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,880
work an average of 62 hours a week and

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,710
that fell consistently for a while but

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:04,310
it's been stagnating and even increase

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,779
since the last financial crash a recent

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,089
study in the UK actually found that

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,700
switching to a four-day workweek didn't

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,350
impact productivity in any way but it

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,490
definitely impacted people's happiness

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,680
an idea that's currently taking hold in

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,140
the United States is that of a job

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,070
guarantee which is basically a federal

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,800
program to provide a guaranteed job with

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:33,500
decent wages and benefits to anyone who

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:36,709
happens to need one and this has caused

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,990
a lot of excitement Ivanka Trump decided

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,730
to weigh in on it saying that I think

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,930
that this idea of a guaranteed minimum

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,640
is not something most people would want

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,500
it's pretty rich coming somebody from

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,040
somebody who already has a guaranteed

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,890
minimum for life but generally speaking

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,130
people want to work we want to feel as

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,950
though we have a purpose but work and

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,560
jobs aren't necessarily the same thing

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,240
there's a lot of valuable work that we

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,180
can do without needing to have it be

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:13,339
attached to a company carrying education

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,560
innovation universal basic income or ubi

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,620
is a way that we could allow for work

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,540
that's unconnected to a job the idea

00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,120
being that all residents of a country

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,360
receive a set income regardless of means

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,580
and it's not new it was first described

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,140
in 1516 in Thomas More's utopia but

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,529
people are still really uncomfortable

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,000
with this idea like it'll make us lazy

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:41,060
in 2016

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,720
77% of Swiss voters rejected the idea of

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,120
ubi in a referendum Finland actually

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,240
just released preliminary results from

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,000
their two-year ubi study in which they

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,890
paid a random sample of 2,000 unemployed

00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,160
people 560 euros a month with no strings

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,690
attached the findings at the present are

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,000
that it increased people's well-being

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,620
but didn't lead to an increase in

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,400
employment levels

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,460
and they've since I'm introduced some

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,700
more restrictive rules in terms of how

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:19,340
welfare is distributed there's a really

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,530
interesting study in Kenya right now

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,900
it's the largest ubi experiment to date

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,870
the expected number of recipients

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,230
exceeds 26,000 people and it's gonna

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,420
take 12 years again they just give them

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,400
free money in a lump sum or spread out

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,710
over that time period with no strings

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,810
attached this can reduce the

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,720
administrative costs of managing a

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,120
welfare state because you don't need to

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,100
track your citizens or have them prove

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,770
that they're looking for work you don't

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,810
need to know who's working or who's not

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,450
and everyone just gets enough money to

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,310
live on it means that you can quit a job

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,340
you aren't happy and to look for another

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:01,910
or to start a business or to go back to

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:05,360
school and learn new things or to take

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,090
care of others it's a way of giving

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,960
power back to individuals and removing

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,330
some from corporations I'm not an

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,740
economist but I have high hopes this

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:20,000
could help us build a more equitable

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,990
world but on an individual level what

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,430
can we do ultimately we can't fight

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,140
technological progress it's going to

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,170
happen regardless of whether we like it

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,690
or not so our best bet is to plan for

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,610
the worst case scenario and assume the

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,570
most radical predictions turned out to

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:41,230
be true there are two keys to surviving

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,050
the robot revolution as an individual

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,520
one is embracing the new technology

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,850
recognize that even if it seems scary

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,360
it's going to happen and start thinking

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,850
that this technology is for you it's not

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,630
here to replace you it's here to make

00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,430
you better

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,790
you can use it to augment your own

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,190
abilities and skills and then teaching

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,400
yourself to work with it rather than get

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,230
done against it some of this is policy

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,540
employers should be providing ongoing

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,510
training for employees and we need to

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,310
encourage people to adopt lifelong

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,510
learning and constantly upgrade their

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:22,460
skills as the economy changes

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,470
but we have one advantage right now in

00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,880
that there's a lot of information on the

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:32,180
Internet so this is what I wanted to do

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,390
I didn't want to be a Luddite I wanted

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:38,330
to see how these tools could benefit me

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,430
and I spent a year trying to make this

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,400
happen

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:45,710
mostly for selfish reasons before I

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,100
joined automatic I freelanced for eight

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,980
years doing client work and I got bored

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,340
events I wanted to do larger scale work

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,260
I wanted to work on products and I

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,970
joined automatic to do that and somehow

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,420
I found myself working on client work

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,480
again so I wanted to really like make

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,770
sure it's stuck this time but I'd also

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,380
been talking to a lot of small

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,720
businesses and I realized that most

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,540
small businesses can't afford good

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,400
visual design they don't have access to

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,580
that and I as a human I'm not scalable

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,470
so I started to think of it like this I

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,890
can use computers to streamline my

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,940
process and generate mock-ups that might

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:34,400
take me hours in a matter of seconds in

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,210
doing this I become a creative director

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,980
I basically give myself a promotion

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:43,970
this is augmentation it doesn't replace

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:47,450
me but it allows me to focus on other

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,340
things to act as a conductor instead of

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:54,830
a violinist so I could work faster or I

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,570
could charge less and do more and work

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,790
with more people I could focus on polish

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,850
once the basics were nailed and I had a

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,730
better baseline to work from or I could

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:12,460
just do more innovative work or get

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:15,140
something done on my endless to-do list

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,000
somewhere along the line this sort of

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,040
became my white whale and it's the thing

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,320
that I'm always talking about or

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,170
thinking about and the spoiler alert

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,850
here and maybe the disappointing thing

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,640
as has been pointed out where is your

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:32,230
robot I don't have a robot

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:34,390
have not yet built I know right it

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,160
disappoints me too and I was trying to

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,180
get it done in the last five minutes but

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,790
I'm not quite there yet I'm not a

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,290
developer or a data scientist or a

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:50,130
statute a statistician I can't even

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:53,080
pronounce it so like it's not happening

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,590
and machine learning is hard and it's

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,560
statistics and it's kind of weird and

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:02,290
I've had some struggles figuring it out

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,090
a friend of mine who does statistics

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,130
recommend to me a book that she swore

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,020
was gonna be super helpful she said it's

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,820
written like a cartoon Sarah it's so

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,520
easy you're going to love it and I was

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,920
so excited and I ordered it and it's 800

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,720
pages and it's currently a doorstop and

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:21,580
I have never read any of those pages

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,830
it's terrifying but I realized maybe I

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,960
don't need to figure this out in five

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,570
minutes or one year what if I could

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,200
figure it out in ten years I can do 10

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,420
years I have time so that's what I'm

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,700
doing now and I'm breaking down the

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,090
problem into little pieces and taking

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,050
them one by one starting small sharing

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,270
what I learn as I go along because I

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:50,040
think that open sourcing this kind of

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,480
work and sharing even in our failures

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,000
means that we can share this technology

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,300
with everyone rather than having it

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,910
centralized in one place giving people

00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,180
access to the new means of production in

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,190
our updated economy so that the benefits

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,240
of that technology will be better

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,620
distributed so I started by looking at

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,400
the parts of my job that could be

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:20,560
automated we think of design as this

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,980
sort of emotional hand-wavy process

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,300
especially the visual parts it's driven

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,380
by instinct or by what feels right and

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,810
that's what it looks like on the surface

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,530
but it's actually more about pattern

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,830
recognition and machines can do that now

00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,930
if I could learn to teach one to do it

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,410
so I utilize my process into logical

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,560
step

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:48,010
what would I do when I sat down with a

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,620
client to design them a website and then

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,950
I tried to teach a machine to do some of

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,650
those things so the first step is to

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,630
collect lots of content I knew from my

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,000
research with small business owners that

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,500
writing content for their sites was a

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,180
real blockers very intimidating for them

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,030
but a lot of them also have content

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,910
elsewhere on the internet on Facebook on

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,030
Instagram on Twitter and we could

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,610
leverage that content so our first step

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,760
was to build out this API and a flow

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:25,000
that gathered all that information and

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,160
pieced it into a logical whole that we

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,500
built this out algorithmically and I

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,790
thought this was gonna be like the

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,050
two-second step at the beginning and

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,660
then we could get to the interesting

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,720
stuff it turns out this bit was actually

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,820
really complex to get right it took a

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,020
lot of time and a lot of testing a lot

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,970
iterating

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,400
to be able to piece together all those

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,150
pieces of content in a way that made a

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:52,480
logical site but once we got it sorted

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,250
out it was actually pretty magical it

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,590
allowed you to build a website in a

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,440
matter of seconds from anywhere I used

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,960
to walk around town on my phone building

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,180
websites for people as I was walking the

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,610
businesses that were around me and it

00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,830
actually worked pretty well Leopold's

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,260
content we pulled photos we pulled their

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,080
logo we built a color scheme based on

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,930
the logo and we pieced all those parts

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,740
together to create the kansai content in

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:23,170
the final step and we set logical

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,540
defaults so if we couldn't find any

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,260
photos for a business we'd pull photos

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,290
based on keywords from pixels this has

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,440
some weird side effects I once built a

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:37,390
site for a Scottish tourism agency and

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,580
it ended up with a photo of a white sand

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,770
beach and a palm tree

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,390
I live in Scotland I don't know what

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,510
part of Scotland that is but it's not

00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,090
the part I live in so it's really

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,130
important here to make these smart

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,350
guesses and defaults but allow for

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,020
people to correct them in case our

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,190
systems

00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,970
and get it right after that content I'd

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,070
have clients fill out a brief asking a

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,220
bunch of questions what's the purpose of

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,410
your site who's your target market

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,460
give me some adjectives to describe your

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,340
organization

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,680
tell me designs that you like what sort

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,210
of mood or field you want to the site

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,620
and that part can be automated too so I

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,050
designed a flow to collect this

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,480
information it was based on the

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,540
questions that I asked clients and it

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,120
used sliders to gauge the mood which

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,070
would then determine the field as well

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,790
as a free-form

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:40,250
adjective input for more granular and

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,960
specific results now this is where the

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,810
machine learning bit would come into

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,640
play because I know from contacts and

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:50,570
experience that if somebody describes

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,330
their business as simple and bold they

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:56,960
probably want a sans-serif typeface

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,430
really clear saturated colors but if

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,920
somebody describes their business as

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,140
organic and natural they're probably

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:09,620
going to want a more subdued color

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:12,020
palette maybe some papyrus I don't put

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,690
for Pyrus in but a computer might we can

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,240
use machine learning to train a computer

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,350
to know this as well so everybody can

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,790
have a papyrus if they really want it

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,360
the next step is presenting these

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:28,580
options the human way of doing this is

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,910
spending a bunch of time thinking and

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:34,310
drawing up things and and hours or days

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,320
or weeks of work and I would present a

00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,510
few designs as style tiles and the

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,210
client would choose one usually would

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,320
choose parts of different ones and then

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,090
we'd go back and forth

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,160
until we landed on something they like

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,620
and that whole process would take at

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,100
least weeks but if we could automate

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,130
this part then it becomes immediate more

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,170
or less we can present to to begin with

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,600
and then if the client doesn't like them

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:02,750
we can immediately generate more with no

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,850
extra effort time or cost

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,330
and we can record their preferences and

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,340
feedback as data which we feedback into

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,070
the model to make it smarter and more

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,010
accurate and the next time the model

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:18,289
makes a guess it's a little closer and

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:21,679
then after hundreds or probably

00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:24,110
thousands of iterations and guesses it's

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,630
able to make smart design decisions that

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:31,190
reflect the client's needs and tastes

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,830
finally once we have all those visual

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,840
choices the last step is to take all

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,890
that content along with the style

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,679
choices and use it to build a site this

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,390
part we actually did do we used the

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,370
business's logo to generate a color

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,230
scheme this doesn't work very well here

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,830
when the logo is black but it works

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,240
better on other things and we generate

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,070
the color schemes algorithmically

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,679
following the same sort of patterns and

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,360
rules that I would use

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,210
we applied into the site with CSS

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,950
variables and we build out the site now

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:08,120
we actually built this before we had

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:10,280
access to Guttenberg and it meant that a

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,380
we had to build a whole editing

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,610
interface like a front-end editing

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,590
interface on her own and we found in

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,220
testing that users were really confused

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,559
when they went from the easy interface

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,720
to the one that wordpress.com was using

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,010
at the time so we never ended up

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,900
launching this and now that we could use

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,470
Gutenberg that story would actually be

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,470
different there are actually a lot of

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,950
parallels between Gutenberg and

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,299
automation people are sometimes worried

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,520
that they'll put them out of a job

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,010
because it makes it easier to do some

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,159
tasks we would have previously needed

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:55,460
humans for but if we look at the problem

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,770
in the same way we have better tools

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,620
that provide us with a better baseline

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,200
on which to work on this is an

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,730
opportunity to innovate and already

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,220
we're seeing an ecosystem that's

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,570
flowering with lots of innovation and

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,570
new ideas coming out

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,000
just like with automation we need to

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:20,590
embrace this new technology and learn to

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,900
work with it rather than against it

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:27,980
ultimately automation is coming in some

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:30,710
form or another at some point and we

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,860
can't stop it no matter how much meat we

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:37,370
might want to so instead of fighting it

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:41,720
let's work with it let's ensure that the

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:45,910
robots work for us the people and

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,910
remember thank you

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,569
[Applause]

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,900
thank you sir I've I'm kind of blown

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,470
away now I don't even know where to

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,180
start

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,570
you were so disappointed I didn't have a

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,690
robot kind of understood the robot is

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,670
kind of living inside your head still

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,640
and some of it sleeping inside a

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:24,620
computer and so on so maybe in ten years

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:27,080
the robot will leave my head yeah but we

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,730
do have time for audio questions so

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,810
please raise your hand if you have

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:44,570
questions for Sarah otherwise we have to

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:47,630
make up that's true yeah yeah that's

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,100
true like a walking metal box and I

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,170
think it would have been a lot cuter had

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,620
I been able to bring one so I'm gonna

00:29:51,170 --> 00:30:04,040
try that for next time

00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:09,620
maybe in London knows I can do that you

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:14,510
had time stop reparations any other

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:16,580
questions I will also be around and I'm

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:20,090
happy to talk about robots I love

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:22,430
talking about robots so I will need I

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:27,140
will have to create a question for you

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:29,000
scientists of my machine head you solve

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,700
the application was it to some kind of

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,060
application you built with automatic

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:38,570
people or was it just something before

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,430
and have you kind of considered now that

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:49,570
you're gonna do the same with the

00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:52,790
Gutenberg the last one was the most

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,190
important question are you trying to do

00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,110
the same with the Gutenberg now kind of

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,170
automate the process that I'm gonna

00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,370
build your company website in two

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,299
minutes when you're going to answer

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:07,049
these questions and afterward

00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:08,519
you have what do you notice so the

00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:13,919
original thing that we built that I

00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:18,840
showed the screenshots of was what's

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:22,950
your robot Kamini was sort of an

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,259
experimental thing of exploring how can

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,600
we make a website more quickly because

00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,360
we knew that that process is very slow

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,279
and arduous for people and it involves a

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,759
lot of switching between screens and

00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:37,350
WordPress now that Gutenberg is

00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,090
available and we knew the good Merck was

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,830
coming but we couldn't use it while we

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,720
were doing it which made doing it very

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,570
difficult because there was this big

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,389
paradigm shift coming that would make it

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:51,149
a bit easier one of the things I'd like

00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:52,710
to do is try to take parts of what we

00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:55,799
built there because I'm not working on

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,679
that right now take parts of what we

00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,799
built right there and sort of repurpose

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,440
them and incorporate parts of Gutenberg

00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,850
into it so the building the site part is

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,470
really quick and it's seamless because I

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,149
I tested what we built with a lot of

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,220
people and what happened was we went

00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:17,340
through this whole flow we showed them a

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,690
website and we let them edit parts of

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,519
the website so they could change the

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,200
title that we'd pulled up or the images

00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,109
or whatever and they they were good

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,700
right up until that process and once

00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,379
they got to the end there was a button

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,389
that said launch your site or something

00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,669
and then it launched their site and it

00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:35,700
made them a wordpress.com site they

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:38,399
converted it and then they ended up in

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,989
an editing screen in WordPress Stockholm

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,749
or the customizer or something and

00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:44,489
people just got so confused and they

00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:47,070
kept saying things to me like can we go

00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,239
back to the easier one I was like I

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,710
would love to take you back to the

00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:54,960
easier one um so rebuilding that part of

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,669
it now that we can access Gutenberg and

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,450
use those components and move things

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:03,029
around more easily would be a key part

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:06,239
of making that whole thing actually

00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:09,539
happen does that answer some of the

00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:12,659
questions yeah at least the last one all

00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,409
right I kind of see that kind of in my

00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,810
head already

00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:18,350
that you

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:22,820
one a new website and you don't have a

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:25,730
big budget like $10,000 or something and

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,910
you still don't have the capability

00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,620
actually you know to do acts on website

00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,920
you don't even know how the blocks works

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:37,430
but you kind of start with that kind of

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,410
idea and you can kind of just fill in

00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,480
the blanks first and it actually creates

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,550
you at least the homepage I don't know

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,700
if it creates four on the blog post in

00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,360
the same time with the CEO and stuff

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,100
like that

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,980
William you mentioned the book for

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,310
example does it do good kind of write

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:59,180
your blog posts also that is definitely

00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:02,000
on my giant long wish list one of the

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,070
things that I realize from talking to a

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,010
lot of people and I focused a lot of my

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,980
my the sort of research user research

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:14,000
that I did on small business owners who

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:16,129
tend to be most time strapped and at

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,230
least sort of tech technically capable

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:19,940
they would love to hire somebody to do

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,500
it but they can't afford it and they try

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,550
to do it themselves and it's a painful

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:29,030
process and part of that is just fear of

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,879
you get this blank page what on earth do

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,129
you do with it and so we were trying to

00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,169
sort of find ways that we could make

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:37,610
that easier for people because if you

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:39,649
give them something to start from and

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,139
then they can just edit it that's a lot

00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:43,879
less intimidating then here's a white

00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,320
screen that you have to fill with stuff

00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,320
and you're not quite sure what

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,750
so in progress well

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:19,190
hello you mentioned that the system is

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,920
based around you finding content from

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,770
Twitter or Facebook and so on and so on

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,800
and so on but what happens if you're a

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,250
brand new company that doesn't have any

00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:37,220
web presence whatsoever but and your

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:39,290
budget is ten quid and you'd still like

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:43,810
to have some sort of web presence

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:47,480
I would this tool then help me so that's

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:51,440
definitely the non-ideal situation that

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,089
we weren't designing for and from sort

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,550
of the data that I looked at it seemed

00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:58,280
like that was actually 50% of businesses

00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,770
who had no presence whatsoever it was

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,680
about half half half had lots and half

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:05,030
had nothing so we try really hard to

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,060
find them and if we couldn't find

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:10,820
anything we'd sort of fall back to a

00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,680
more wizardy process

00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,589
I just wanted an excuse to draw pictures

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,109
of robots but it would ask okay so

00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,510
what's your business name what's it

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,760
about and you sort of fill in the blanks

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,710
and then it would pull from that and

00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,540
then you'd get to okay well we've made

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,630
you a site based on the answers you gave

00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:32,000
us and so it's still a bit more wizardy

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,050
than just well here's a website do what

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,930
you can with it but it's definitely

00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,880
easier when you have that content one of

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,180
the things we looked into doing and

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,290
never got around to was sort of like a

00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:51,230
mad libs approach to content as well

00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,540
about me actually does this really well

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,250
it asks you for a couple of things

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,589
you're interested in and then it makes

00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,300
like a paragraph of text that's your bio

00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:03,050
that includes the stuff that you're

00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:06,290
interested in it's a really easy way of

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:09,140
making content while asking for really a

00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,849
really small number of inputs so that

00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,089
was sort of what we're driving toward

00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:13,089
there

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,609
right unfortunately we don't have time

00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:25,749
for other questions anymore we have a 20

00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:29,979
minute break now so we'll continue in 20

00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:32,520
minutes in here in the track 1 I'll see

00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:35,430
you later and pick applause for Sarah
