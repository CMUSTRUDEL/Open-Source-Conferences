Title: Christian Nikkanen: Revamping a web service with a React single page app
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	We built a React single page application for one of the largest Finnish technology magazines. It replaced their old traditional WordPress site at the end of 2018.
The application has been in development for over a year now. It’s time to share our experiences building it, talk about why we built it, and how we built it. Because there were a lot of problems, I’ll talk about how we resolved them.
To name a few: authenticating users to WordPress, social media previews, search engine visibility, integration testing, and last but not least, cache invalidation in all parts of the stack.
Everyone in the audience should be able to grasp the main points, but developers will get most out of the talk.
