Description: 
	Think that the UX process is only for big agencies with big clients and big budgets? Think again! UX research and methodology can, and even must, be part of any web project, no matter the size. It’s possible, and I’ll show you how. In fact, you’re probably doing UX research already in some form, and you don’t even know it.
This talk demystifies UX and shows you how to make it an integral part of your web design process. The improvement is guaranteed: for you, your clients, and your clients’ clients.
