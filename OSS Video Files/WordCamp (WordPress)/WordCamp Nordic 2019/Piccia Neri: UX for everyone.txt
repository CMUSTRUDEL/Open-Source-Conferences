Title: Piccia Neri: UX for everyone
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Think that the UX process is only for big agencies with big clients and big budgets? Think again! UX research and methodology can, and even must, be part of any web project, no matter the size. It’s possible, and I’ll show you how. In fact, you’re probably doing UX research already in some form, and you don’t even know it.
This talk demystifies UX and shows you how to make it an integral part of your web design process. The improvement is guaranteed: for you, your clients, and your clients’ clients.

good morning again so the web can be

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,240
scary just like this very big room so

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,750
years ago and the most difficult thing

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,539
about it about it wasn't learning about

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,460
HTML CSS and you know coding that was

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,670
actually that was that was fun but he

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,609
was how vastly different designing for

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,880
the web is from designing a book a

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,610
magazine a brochure a film poster or a

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,100
or a marketing concept which is what

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,760
it's the type of things that I was doing

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,840
at the time so the design principles

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,870
that you use when you design the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,450
interface of anything are the same of

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,440
course but it was the planning the

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,300
different surfaces to fill the innate

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,809
interactivity and above all the role

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,480
that users play that felt hugely

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,480
different and the hardest thing was to

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,600
fathom how to organize all those pages

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,380
that didn't follow their logical non

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,530
nested non interactive sequencing of

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,710
printed material so the logic behind a

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,460
well built website seemed are came to me

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,299
and I needed to work it out and then I

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,729
thought of UX which to begin with to be

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,220
honest felt even scarier because I had

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,439
experienced the UX process when I was

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,740
working at the BFI which is the British

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,540
Film Institute in London and I was in

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,540
charge of the creative direction when

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,329
the web team was working on a redesign

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,970
with an external agency so it was a

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,060
really long and complex process and it

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,430
was incredibly interesting because I was

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,750
involved in working with very large

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,820
teams on both sides and large budgets as

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,579
well and he was eliminating I learnt

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,860
about personas and learnt about user

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,229
journeys and so on and so a lot of the

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,049
mystique behind it was sort of revealed

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,770
to me and I learnt also what made the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,770
difference between a web project and a

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,540
creative concept sorry a BFI website is

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,660
actually still as bad as he was ten

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,850
years ago if not

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,070
little worse because that's what happens

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,340
sometimes with large organizations so in

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,410
a way if you're smaller you can have the

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,640
edge because changes are much easier to

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,100
make so when I went solar on the web and

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,100
I had to work out how to create websites

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,930
that helped customers as well as the

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:40,750
businesses I asked myself can UX help me

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,570
can I find a way of adapting the process

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,350
so that I can create websites that make

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,570
sense help the users and also help the

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,450
businesses by making sales or capturing

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,350
leads and perhaps even more importantly

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,420
can I do all this on a small budget and

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:03,580
with a very small team or no team even

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:05,620
or a team of one short answer is yes so

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,290
if you're a solo agent or a small agency

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,670
looking to improve your processes then

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,270
this talk will really help you but if

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:16,360
you're a big guy who has a girl who's

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,010
worked with very large projects on you

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,750
know with big teams then it's probably

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,290
of no interest you already know and you

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,060
probably have processes that are much

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,570
more complicated than what I can

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,590
possibly show you so having made this

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,510
premise what is UX you acts for some

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,240
designers or developers and especially

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,220
clients small business owners who

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,590
haven't been involved in the process

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,930
before you can sound like a buzz word or

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,610
a trendy term or even though actually

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,970
it's been around for a long time now

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,420
because I think that Don Norman Apple

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,040
created the first UX roles about at

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,080
least you know I think about 20 years

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,320
ago now

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,450
well what those two letters stand for as

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,030
you probably know is very simple it's

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,470
user experience so when we come to think

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,350
of it it's a really really simple

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,390
concept but it's also essential because

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,790
what is a website without user

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,370
experience it simply put it just doesn't

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,410
so whether you have thought about it or

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,380
not your website or your app or even

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,540
your product will give your users and

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,850
experience it's as simple as that and

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,250
it's pretty much inevitable so

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,759
when it's unseen the user experience of

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,090
a any project there are three essential

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,520
components to consider so the first one

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,220
is the look because visual experience is

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,220
essential to establishing understanding

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,860
together with credibility and Trust as

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,090
well as the good feeling that Beauty

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,889
gives us then is how we feel is it's a

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,490
joy to use this website and interact

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:58,250
with it and then how actually usable the

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:03,639
website or Apple product is predictably

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:06,500
easy to use and and functional as well

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,440
to be clearer let's have a look at a few

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,780
examples of users experiencing real life

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,580
products and having a good time or not

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:19,550
so good time with them this is an actual

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,860
real bike path in the city where I live

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,259
Valencia in Spain and this bike

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,720
pass/fail is not the only one but it's

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:30,380
for sure the most spectacular in town

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,409
and moreover it's a tired path which

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,110
makes for him try to bumpy ride at any

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:38,810
time and very slippery when it's wet or

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,520
raining or when they've cleaned the

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,009
roads which and I have the scars to

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,320
prove it I can assure you so what

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,719
emotions does this experience generate

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,610
well first of all is frustration because

00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:51,680
we have to pad back now we can't go

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,930
anywhere the second one is bewilderment

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,909
because you like who the hell thought

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,659
about this I mean how can you do this

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:01,759
and then the blast feeling is definitely

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,370
anger I don't need to explain that I

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,199
don't think so if you had planned this

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,539
experience and if you had emphasized

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,789
with the users you would have got a

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,520
result that it's a bit more like this

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,349
one also you know this is a wonderful

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,599
feeling of order because you know

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:20,330
exactly where to go and where you need

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,699
to be and what the path is for then

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,240
safety because the cars are safely

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,130
completely somewhere else and then

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,080
anticipation because I've really looked

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,740
forward to the wonderful event adventure

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,930
ahead of me so if you compare it with

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,849
this other real-life situation which

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,080
actually looks like something that needs

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,479
a graphical treatment

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,009
it so therefore similar to a problem

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,860
that we might be asked to solve as

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,900
designers so first of all I think if I

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,870
were to park here I would definitely

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,389
first feel overwhelmed and then I would

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,729
be which would be followed by confusion

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,020
and then in the end I was just to come

00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,330
to despair

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,250
because I would probably give up parking

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,090
in this spot altogether I mean there's

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:08,000
no point compared with this instead so

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,310
here I get an immediate feeling of

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,250
clarity because I can interpret with

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,759
certainty what I'm meant to do here and

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:20,060
then this all brings wonderful peace of

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:23,840
mind and basically they want against the

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:28,069
big guys so the the the big lesson

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,050
behind all this is ignore your users at

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:35,000
your peril so the online version of all

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,250
this is you know vaguely and a rather

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,889
daring comparison is Facebook because

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,770
the final experiencing with Facebook is

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,419
completely shaped by its users and it's

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,889
developed in ways that the creators

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,400
could not possibly have predicted

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:51,319
however just like the previous example

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,270
this is this unpredicted organic

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,279
environment is the result of a planned

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,389
vision and that's what makes the

00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,430
difference because the vision behind

00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,169
Facebook was always to create

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,110
user-generated content so it's not a

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:05,120
surprise because if you don't plan it

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,310
could go like this this is my favorite

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,599
website ever and I invite you to also

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,219
check that the code the source code and

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,650
it's a living and breathing an example

00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,629
of a UX that's so wrong it is actually

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,800
right which can happen because this is a

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,520
website that is conceived to be utterly

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,009
over-the-top and it grew organically

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,779
over the years and it's animated and

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,479
garish and it really isn't about the

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,849
user so much it's all about link the

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,839
owner and it is completely unapologetic

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:38,000
about it and that is its strength but I

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
don't recommend following the example

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,709
because she's I mean Ling is a maverick

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,420
genius she really is and she turns

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:46,399
everything to gold and no you know

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,690
probably I wouldn't say no one else but

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,819
very few other people in the world can

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,550
get away with it and her business is

00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:54,149
100% solid so she

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,070
can do whatever she wants but you know

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,610
so in a nutshell whether you've planned

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,300
this or not your users will inevitably

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,300
experience your sight

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,550
so while unplanned organic growth can

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,160
and it does happen it's not the norm any

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,920
hands it tends to happen anyway within a

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,899
highly planned project that is used in

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
alternative ways but its end users it

00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,450
hardly ever happens when no planning s

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,130
has taken place so the difference is

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,750
that if you have planned your users

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,269
experience you likely to first of all

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,130
control it and then you give them what

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,110
you want them to experience and you're

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,970
also highly likely to give them a better

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:37,899
experience so a hundred percent failed

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,839
to plan equals the planning to fail so

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,459
just do it planet you know and you can

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,240
totally do it anyone can do it and

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:48,910
really I maintain on any budget so

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,390
starting from the end how do you know if

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,519
a size R gives good UX what are the

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,279
benchmarks for that so we already know

00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,550
that it needs to have good looks and

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,149
feel and usability but then if you can

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,810
answer these three questions does the

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,010
site replication give the user value

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,829
does the user find the site or

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,529
application simple to use and to

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,440
navigate and does the user actually

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:20,140
enjoy using the site or the application

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,790
it's very very simple questions but you

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,100
can see immediately that there is one

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:29,140
key word that we keep repeating here

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:32,440
fairly obviously that it's user so you

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,750
axe design is simply user centered

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,870
design and Don Norman again from Apple

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:40,270
first mentioned it in his 1988 book the

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,550
design of everyday things so they color

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,410
travel projects and elsewhere because it

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,810
does it in various places and I'll have

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,339
other examples that I'll spare you all

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,779
failed because the vanity of the

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,940
architect and all the city planners

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,970
we're at the center of the project

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,730
rather than the users and I think this

00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,220
is the shift that we need to make those

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,410
of us who work with small clients

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,050
because smaller clients tend to think

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,940
that it's all about them and there

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,070
brother and about their business and

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,380
well they're also users and they're

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,260
humans as well so they also definitely

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,170
play a role it's not all about them it's

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,700
also you could argue mostly but it

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,579
depends anyway about the end users so

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,980
this is the definition of UX design from

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,690
the interaction design foundation which

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,430
is brilliant and I recommend it to you

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,790
if you don't know it and I'm just going

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,670
to read it so user centered design is an

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,370
iterative design process in which

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,250
designers focus on the users and their

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,320
needs in each phase of the design

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,990
process

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,690
UCD calls for involving users throughout

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,209
the design process via a variety of

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,680
research and design techniques so as to

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,740
create highly usable and accessible

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,380
products for them and by the by actually

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,540
you don't need to even be a designer or

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,880
have a design degree for sure to carry

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,510
out much or the yucks process as we'll

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,579
see it so in a way the UX process can be

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,910
adapted to a number of situation and not

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,920
just web projects so I think that this

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,700
is what is revolutionary for a lot of

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,560
old-style designers which I used to be

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,600
instead of designing in a sort of ivory

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,420
tower we really need to get down and out

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,480
and mix with our users with one caveat

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,970
to be careful and maintain your role and

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,500
authority as a designer because you

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,380
still need to be the one calling the

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,240
shots you that you are the professional

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,970
so for the UX process there is a

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,829
methodology called design thinking that

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,270
can be extremely useful

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,770
it has drawbacks like anything and

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,959
detractors but I'll go into that now

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:53,910
it's very very useful so basically it's

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,980
but using a design thinking process you

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,740
make decisions based on what customers

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,490
really need rather than just relying on

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,010
historical data or making risky bets or

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,990
gaseous based on instinct instead of

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,029
evidence for example a real-life

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,730
situation that came to me a prospect

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,760
saying that wasn't my client yet saying

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,019
we need to increase our traffic we don't

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,120
have enough visitors to a site

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:20,949
the traditional way of solving this

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,870
would be to say okay well let's do a

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,970
Google Apps campaign or a Facebook

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,519
campaign or look at other methods of you

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,129
know track building traffic but the

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,860
design thinking approach is to ask why

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:37,089
which is also the UX design approach the

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,339
first question is always why so when I

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,290
asked why do you need an increase in

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,230
traffic the answer was that they're not

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,379
getting as many sales as usual as usual

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,810
so the next question is why aren't you

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,790
getting enough sales maybe you do get

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,870
enough traffic but not enough visitors

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,269
are converting so why does that happen

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,829
so in the case in hand I actually found

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,250
out from the analytics they were the

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:05,889
website considering had zero SEO zero

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,759
anything actually did get a decent

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:11,379
amount number of visitors but there was

00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,480
absolutely nothing for them to do once

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,490
they got to decide or to come back for

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,290
the contact forms were buried you

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,480
couldn't actually tell where the website

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,029
was actually selling from visiting the

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,459
homepage so they need wasn't traffic he

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:27,250
was on page optimisation and without the

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,439
initial why question it would have been

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,660
just easy to do what the client asked

00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:35,110
for and get them to waste money on on on

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:39,189
ads or Google or Facebook so then what I

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,420
did is I ran a short survey of the with

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:43,809
some of the existing clients which

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,490
confirmed my initial analysis which was

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,750
there was absolutely nothing for them to

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,329
do and it was quite difficult to find

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,339
the concept form and this is a boutique

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,740
travel agency that only sells via direct

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:57,129
contact so they only talk to people that

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,470
the sale happens off line anyway so by

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,600
putting in why question first and then

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,000
asking the users I got to the real

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,699
problem and this is what design thinking

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,250
is all about because it's human human

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,350
centric it gives us a framework for the

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,959
UX process and more importantly it makes

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,500
users make sure that we put the users

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:21,279
firmly at the center of the process and

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,019
that is empathy so in the case of the

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,550
website that I just mentioned a short

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:30,279
term solution because we were just not

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,110
into the big job yet

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,089
without a redesign was to first of all

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,430
change the headline and actually explain

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,019
what the website was about which is

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,579
literally boutique walking tours on the

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,589
Camino de Santiago that's that's all it

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,889
is and adding an immediately visible

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,720
find out more button and a testimonial

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,209
for credibility and social sharing

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,939
buttons so this still didn't mean there

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,559
was anything to convert to or that the

00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:56,019
folks are still involved the users in

00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,329
anyway but the experience of the users

00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,680
was immediately improved because we put

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,779
them at the center while the previous

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,249
homepage had been designed because they

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,350
you know simply to the taste or the

00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,089
users or their business owners and liked

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,230
the image and thought that that quote

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:13,990
was so poetic so this design thinking

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,779
process that puts the users firmly

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,360
ethics Center it's built on five phases

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,129
and they're non linear so I'm just gonna

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,439
give you a very sort of quick overview

00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,230
because it's a big thing so the first

00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,720
phase is empathize which is with the

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,870
users which is instrumental in defining

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,589
the problem then you id8 the solution

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:38,589
and you prototype it and then you test

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,509
it so sometimes you will need and this

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:43,120
is the essential bit you will need to go

00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:45,779
from the prototype back to the idea or

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,490
from the test back to the definition or

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:50,980
from the test back to the idea again or

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,769
sometimes from the test all the way back

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,680
to the empathy phase that is to say

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,689
we'll see it's the research so what I

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,089
call their abbreviated you have

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,689
processed because you X can be huge and

00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:06,939
you know take humongous teams and have

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,589
loads of really the testing is just

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,110
another way of calling it and to me

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,329
research is what takes up most of the

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,419
time because if you do that well then

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,799
you will have less going back and forth

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:19,449
not that is there's anything I mean

00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,449
they're going back and forth once you've

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,789
you get to the testing is essentially

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,309
it's the best bit about it and it's what

00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:29,080
I love as opposed to print because in

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:30,820
prints when it's done it's done you know

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,460
you see a type when you literally tear

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,409
your hair out and there's no going back

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,130
but with this it's fantastic because you

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,960
can base your you can you know improve

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,629
the

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,360
the success of anything just by going

00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:49,139
back testing improving optimizing and so

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,879
on so this is how the two processes are

00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:53,429
integrated so empathize and define

00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:56,220
correspond to research then ideation

00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:59,460
prototype correspond to design and then

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,619
test and validation are essentially the

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,679
same it's the same thing just two ways

00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:06,179
of calling the same thing now this may

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,100
seem like a long and complicated process

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,379
when we're dealing with smaller clients

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,399
who maybe have never heard of it so how

00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:16,110
do we sell it to them well there are so

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,509
many advantages to good UX I'm just

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,299
going to tell you a few of them here so

00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:23,700
first of all you ax is a quality quality

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,559
measure so it improves a business's

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,379
reputation because the users are happy

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,919
but if they're not happy then it could

00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:34,740
it could really you know break be much

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,629
worse so defining needs from the

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,299
beginning maybe this is the biggest one

00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:42,330
makes it much easier to complete on time

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,970
and on budget and then it's much more

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,669
expensive really obviously to fix bad

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,070
mistakes and thanks to the research you

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:53,700
know what the competitors are doing and

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,440
your product will be better for it and

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,850
no point building something that isn't

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,769
needed because you know if you don't ask

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,940
first whether you users need something

00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:05,309
why build it so just do it sometime just

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,200
don't sell it you could do it in a day

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,720
if you want it's perfectly possible to

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,730
the whole thing in a day just build it

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,860
into the budget and do it so also

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,860
consider there is always two audiences

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:25,860
in your UX process and that's the

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:28,409
stakeholders which means anyone who any

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,899
business owner or manager or event

00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:33,960
sometimes employees that have a stake in

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:37,200
the project on the business size site

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:41,610
and then the users and you we need to

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,860
empathize with both so in a big UX

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,539
project there's usually you know there's

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,940
a big team with as I was saying earlier

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,379
where everyone you there's lots of

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,700
different roles and lots of different

00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:53,910
phases to it but

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,210
we can simplify hugely to achieve a 1

00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:01,080
and still get great results so the

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,840
research phase stake is when you hold

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,720
stakeholders interviews and users

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,690
interviews and you need to find out as

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,620
much as possible about your clients

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,330
business and their market and you can do

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,250
it with questionnaires or workshops

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,750
because in my experiences some clients

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,250
to just say oh I can't write I can't be

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,470
bothered to write so what you do is say

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,480
okay great and well that's what give me

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,040
an hour of your time and you you know

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,470
you do a zoom call or you see them in

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,170
person and you just run them through all

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,450
these questions about their business and

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,270
usually when you ask start asking lots

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,250
of questions so many things come up

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,690
about their business they will inform

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,320
the designers especially if you keep

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:46,200
asking why things like well I want you

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,200
know always say I want a new website why

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,260
what's wrong with a existing one even

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,500
the simplest declarations that seem

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,900
self-explanatory always ask why even if

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,600
you can see that the website is rubbish

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,750
it's not responsive or whatever asking

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,030
because it may always unearth things

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,090
that you hadn't considered you know that

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,070
the owner doesn't even know so and also

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,200
another important thing to take into

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,180
consideration so I'm just gonna do this

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,710
because this is where we get to the

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,240
definition of the problem but I ask you

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,440
the questions we get to the definitional

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,600
problem and also always find out who is

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,460
going to be influenced by the changes by

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,680
the new project because sometimes the

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,130
business owners don't involve the

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,740
employees and that can mean a project

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,830
failing when the employees actually

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,790
either feel disgruntled because they've

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,560
been ignored or they use the product the

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,780
website the app whatever it is on a

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,580
daily basis so they may have insights

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,140
that the business owners don't have and

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,180
also business owners sometimes suffer

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,150
from proximity blindness was a too close

00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,400
to the business so you always need to

00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:00,180
ask as many people as possible anyway so

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,539
we only define face but also we need to

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,749
ask obviously the users hold

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,460
users interviews now this sometimes is a

00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:11,340
bit more complicated with more clients

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:17,789
because some of them what sorry I just

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:20,609
so it's because sometimes you know it's

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:23,369
more a small agency may not or a or a

00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:26,009
start up may not even have actually have

00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:28,950
users yet so just be creative you can

00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:30,779
use Facebook groups you can use with

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,889
questionnaires and surveys you can do

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,029
workshops as well when you have the

00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:37,799
budget and then this will lead you to

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,529
the user personas but also with small

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:43,169
businesses ask the owners because often

00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:46,289
and a small business was created by

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:50,039
someone who was a user and had that

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:52,769
problem so they often can give you a lot

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,899
so what you need to know in order to

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,359
create user personas and this is really

00:22:54,899 --> 00:23:00,179
really essential so you need to know the

00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:03,090
who so their demographics you need to

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,489
know even more importantly than why the

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,859
the the emotions the feelings and what

00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:10,590
that you know the successful outcome

00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,379
that a desire then the needs what do

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,509
they need and the solution can we how

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,950
can we meet their needs and then the

00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,960
flow where do they come from

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,359
and what do they do when they get to the

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,159
website and then give them a name always

00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,139
give them a name and do whatever you do

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,099
for them so in the case of the boutique

00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:32,190
travel agency who is sharing fifty five

00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:33,989
North American retired and so on why is

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,940
really important they have a burning

00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:37,440
desire to complete the community come

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,879
you know Santiago to fulfill the promise

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,169
made to a relative who passed away but

00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:42,929
they're really worried they're not fit

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,399
enough and they also want to have a

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:47,009
comfortable time they can't you know

00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:50,669
they won't do want to rough it up so in

00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:52,769
the research we get to the site map and

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,679
the user personas that's where we've got

00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:58,139
to now just as a reminder then we get to

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,720
the design which is actually still the

00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:05,849
planning phase so nothing to do with the

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:08,099
UI yet and sitemap renews so this is

00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,179
that is what the design phase means site

00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,359
mapping user personas

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:16,530
user flows super important and then the

00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:18,690
wireframes now this is what was done at

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,790
first because now I am designing with

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,510
sharing in my sharing in mind so it's

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,010
still not a proper redesign but

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,380
everybody can do the community Santiago

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,960
is what Sharon wants to know as soon as

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,600
she gets onto the website I'm talking to

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,370
her directly but we need to draw draw

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,890
them in and sometimes she visits but

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,390
she's not ready to buy yet however you

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,310
know or even get a discount voucher

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,610
however big and bright we make their

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:48,360
button it's just pointless so we decided

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:51,210
that a funnel with a quiz was a thing to

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,330
do so we need to address all her fears

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,310
and needs and that can best be done with

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,990
a quiz because no one can resist a quiz

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,110
and the answers in a quiz can really

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,790
address the thing now this is the really

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,800
really revolutionary thing which if

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,680
you've never done I really encourage you

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,270
to do because by doing I mean a site map

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,870
is very useful but when you put yourself

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,670
firmly in Sharon's hiking boots and you

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,950
think okay she gets she sees the

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,050
Facebook ad she's interested but

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,390
sometimes she's ready or not ready so

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,160
what happens if she's not ready I have

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,890
to sort of rush through this a bit but

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,050
you you've got the slides after this is

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,700
what makes such a difference because if

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,350
you do a flow like this first of all you

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,810
will feel really reassured that you've

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:37,440
you've considered all situations and

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:41,280
then it makes the actual design phases

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,160
so much quicker and then wireframes is

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,810
what comes after the user flow but which

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,210
is you know an image or a set of images

00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,790
that actually is just everything goes on

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,200
the page without the styling you don't

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:56,250
always need to do them yet

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,050
because sometimes I do them when I have

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,730
to hand the project off but if I'm doing

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,430
everything myself there's no need you

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,650
can skip them if you're a team of one or

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,360
if you use a page builder because if you

00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,740
use a page builder sometimes there's no

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,990
point you know and with low budget

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,300
clients we often use page builders so

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,120
because I'm thinking like Sharon this is

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,670
the landing page for the quiz because it

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,620
will reassure her her it asks the right

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,290
questions and it has a photo that Sharon

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,840
can identify with and that triggers the

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,900
right emotions and then acquits

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,480
quiz itself addresses all of Sharon's

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,610
fears and questions she has

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,149
again a photo that she can identify with

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,919
and and offering a free list of what to

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:39,919
pack on the Camino that she will

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,130
definitely find useful then the

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,470
validation is where you test the things

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:48,039
but again you can test after you've

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,970
launched you can do that on a low-budget

00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,610
project you can definitely do it

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,470
so usability testing on a shoestring and

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,110
a deadline Gurria so go into a coffee

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,669
shop and ask people just randomly can

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,799
you test this even if they're not a

00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:02,330
target audience your parent your kids

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,950
your parents your colleagues haven't

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,279
worked in a project your friends their

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,049
parents their kids anyone or Facebook

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,970
groups faithfuls Facebook groups are

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,639
brilliant I mean in this case I found

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,710
colleagues there on online who were a

00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:19,370
hundred percent the demographic all her

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,260
husband and her parents friends parents

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,529
who are also the the right people and

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,350
the a few online tours to carry out

00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:31,159
usability testing some of the not near

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,570
they're all the dude variously different

00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,539
things but are all super useful and

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:38,720
they're either very cheap or they're

00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:41,299
free so we're not free but not all of

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,490
them but they're definitely cheap so

00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,679
also bear in mind that sometimes five

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,269
tests can give you the problems you can

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,880
already find out enough with five ten

00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:51,950
you don't need that as many as you think

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,600
so basically the whole point about you

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,179
acts that is that it's not a solution

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,220
that's perfect straight out of the box

00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:00,559
that's the whole point it's precisely

00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,200
the optimation for opium ization phase

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,990
so that's why it's methodologies such as

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,330
agile or lean work so well with with UX

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,980
because deploy quickly starlett deploy

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,529
quickly and then go back and optimize

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,789
all the time so make sure that your

00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,610
clients are aware of this and then

00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,289
expect perfection straight away as you

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,880
launch because that's probably not going

00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:22,940
to happen but you get a solution out

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,389
then look at the data go back and make

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,000
it better so this is see the you know

00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:30,260
the design thinking process it's always

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,429
about going back

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:40,389
so basically back it's Eddie right try

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:40,389
again fail again fail better thank you

00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:53,359
can I just say very quickly there's a

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,799
Facebook groups group too cool design

00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,249
for geeks where we talk about these

00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,159
things all day long and also there's a

00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:04,099
free UX course coming up soon if you're

00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,450
interested thank you thank you very much

00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,269
that was even better than I thought

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:11,929
before and thank you so we have time for

00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:13,849
questions now let's actually try with

00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,320
the same at wordcamp europe if you have

00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,039
ever been there so we have one

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,679
microphone over there and if you have

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,919
any questions can you rise up and walk

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,710
to that microphone and ask your

00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,899
questions from there we also have this

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,929
funny thing that we can just roll on you

00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:36,970
if you want to check that out but if you

00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:43,190
have questions can you stand up and walk

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:45,679
right before microphone you must at

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:50,359
least one I do not mind a question if

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:56,659
you don't have don't be shy you a tall

00:29:50,359 --> 00:30:00,919
finish okay I have one question yeah

00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:03,289
yeah I just need to made it up now you

00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,570
were mentioning about their user testing

00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:08,479
and you kind of already mentioned that

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,669
it's it might be a little bit hard with

00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:12,409
the smaller companies yeah or even the

00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:15,999
midsize companies because they don't

00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:19,039
have the resources to do that and you

00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:21,289
kind of mentioned what other other ways

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,929
of - in the user testing can you kind of

00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:26,570
walk us through a little bit more and

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:29,059
another kind of related question as that

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,029
is what is the biggest differences in

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,210
kind of stakeholder kind of interviews

00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:39,710
and with their user interviews or

00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:42,200
whatever you do with those for the

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,450
usability I really think that usability

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,729
is the scariest scariest thing and I

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,759
think that in a way it is the easiest

00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:51,950
thing because the the what we think when

00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,690
you think of user testing people think

00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,749
of you know big companies getting a

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,639
focus group in a room and making them

00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:00,440
tested product and so on but there's

00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:02,200
being in focus group

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,270
have used focus groups and sometimes

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,280
they rule out things that shouldn't be

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,410
ruled out in a way it's much much better

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,480
to not have a focus group I think it's

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,510
an advantage and look at you know I was

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,340
mentioning the BFI projects they if you

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,000
visit the website is terrible and it

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,380
still is

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,390
and if they've been trying to improve it

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,250
for ten years and it can't go past the

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:25,100
focus groups and there and there all the

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,540
red tape so user testing really gets

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,910
someone who's never seen the product

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,700
please use a friend even if they're not

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,240
the user that the the actual target

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,340
audience he can be even better imagine

00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,770
someone who doesn't have a clue about

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,230
what it is that you're building who for

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,940
a walk it is full put them there and say

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,130
what do you do when you see this do you

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,400
understand who it is for it's even

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:53,690
better and just like I said I mean I had

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,990
to run for it cuz I was late but anyone

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,790
will do and then if you want instead if

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,430
you have to test things that are much

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,900
more specific to the audience than

00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,940
Facebook groups I mean you know love it

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,090
or hate it Facebook can be very very

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,010
useful and I found so much help in

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,820
Facebook groups but from and I actually

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:17,960
did stumble upon my absolutely perfect

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:20,000
audience so it's it's actually what

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,400
seems like the scariest thing is the

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,960
easiest thing but to make sure that it's

00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,520
it's always that you find people who are

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,070
as far removed from the project as

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,410
possible because you will also suffer

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,890
from proximity blindness and it will be

00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,870
become very difficult for you to

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:41,750
understand what may or may not be

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,370
working there Oriana state they take

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:48,440
different stakeholders interviews and

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:50,930
users interviews stakeholders interviews

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,340
are really to find out about what's

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:59,750
wrong with the business because even if

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,790
it's a relatively healthy company if

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,990
they come to you for any reason that

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,030
means that there's always something that

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,250
may be wrong is the wrong word actually

00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:10,100
but something that needs changing or

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,800
that needs improving and as you probe

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,460
and you ask questions things come up I

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,039
mean in

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,860
in it could be for instance that the two

00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,549
business owners are not getting on or

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,350
that one of them is really thinking of

00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:25,669
being a hands off the business and sort

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,919
of that so that's why they're trying to

00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:30,799
build a different system so that's what

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,779
you need to do that's your your task is

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,789
and that's why the why questions always

00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:38,480
why white wine then always ask them to

00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:40,340
pick the their main why because when you

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,820
ask why as we were saying the difference

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,799
between the who's the who the who is the

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,559
the you know demographics and

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,320
psychographics when you ask why to a

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,350
business owner it's also psychographics

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,750
you will find out what the successful

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,210
desired outcome is which the same thing

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:02,090
applies to both users and and and owners

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,770
but with the users it is a little bit

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,890
more difficult because they are a bit

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:10,899
further removed from you so you have to

00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:15,260
put yourself in their shoes somehow and

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:18,050
it requires I think a little bit more

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,210
empathy because you are kind of more on

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,520
the client side that you are on the user

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,560
side so sometimes of course that's why

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,960
people choose niches because when you

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,060
choose a niche then you get to know know

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,830
them really well and then you understand

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,480
them a little bit better I think there

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,629
aren't dangers to that because I think

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,800
that actually you may find yourself as I

00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:38,839
was saying either again the proximity

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,490
blindness or you may sort of be

00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,700
repeating the same solution for a

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,470
certain industry whereas different even

00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,210
if it's the same industry different

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:51,649
businesses may have completely different

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:54,700
issues does that answer or or less yeah

00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:57,589
okay pretty much yeah thank you

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,270
if there are no other questions from the

00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:01,760
audience

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:06,170
can you work or we can we have the mic

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,599
from which tested out its asteroid hello

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:14,750
I am Monty and I would like to ask you

00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:17,510
how would you use analytical data in the

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,790
design design process or does it have

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,369
any value like Google Analytics or hot

00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,589
char huge huge huge huge absolutely huge

00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:25,290
value I mean this is what it's sort of

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:29,100
the size

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:32,520
face I see that this this is the very

00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:37,460
abbreviated sort of story of the face

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,350
before launch but definitely I don't I

00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,600
usually use someone external to do the

00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,760
analytics because that's not my strong I

00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,480
don't actually want to learn but it's

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,770
it's it's such a complex area and you

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,990
need to get it right you need to have

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,540
someone that sets the goals correctly

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,000
you choose a conversion or more than one

00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,890
you you know set the goals in Google

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,890
Analytics and then you look at the data

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,810
and you think okay this is we guess

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,990
wrong this was a guess we didn't

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,460
actually back it up with evidence

00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,620
obviously it doesn't work which could be

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,020
for instance the type of freebie that

00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,780
you choose it may be that the analytics

00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,840
show you know if no one downloads it it

00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,640
means it's of no interest to the to the

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,040
end user so yes

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,500
analytics are hugely hugely important

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,630
but usually comes after so you launch

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,090
and then you know start deploy optimize

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,070
and you keep going back and optimizing

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,690
and seeing what works in this project

00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,180
that I'm talking about which is ongoing

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,580
it's live now I'm talking to them right

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,710
now because I don't think that first is

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,780
the big button where the discount does

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,300
nothing I think if I take it out

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,460
nothing will change but there's another

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,920
discount placed somewhere else which is

00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,230
a pop-up when with doesn't when there's

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,970
intend to leave and that works people go

00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,310
for it because they need a little bit

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,940
more time they're not gonna press a

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:02,640
button the minute they land on your site

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:05,100
so I'm optimizing that as we speak and I

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,900
think I haven't used aggressive enough

00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,460
techniques to get there you know at the

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,450
end of the quiz I'm not forcing anyone

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:16,110
to give the their email address to in

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:18,630
order to know the results but again

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,360
don't be too attached to the analytics

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,490
because even though a lot of people have

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,290
completed the quiz not many have

00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,200
downloaded the freebie which is how we

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,750
get their email address but what I'm

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,760
thinking is this type of people get in

00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,320
touch directly and now they've taken the

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,150
quiz they know that I can do the Camino

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,460
they've learned a hell of a lot on the

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,200
Camino by doing the quiz

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,170
they come back the fact that they

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,210
haven't we haven't got their email

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,400
address now doesn't mean that that we're

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,380
not in there you know they were not

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,820
their favorite travel agency for the

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,849
Camino yet so yeah so I hope that does

00:37:53,820 --> 00:38:00,740
that answer the question basically yes

00:37:55,849 --> 00:38:00,740
