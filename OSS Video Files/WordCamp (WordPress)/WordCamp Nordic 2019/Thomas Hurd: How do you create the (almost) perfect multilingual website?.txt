Title: Thomas Hurd: How do you create the (almost) perfect multilingual website?
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	In 2017 Thomas spoke about how to plan a multilingual design site properly based on User Experience principles and some common sense (that perhaps wasnâ€™t so common). This time around, he will show you how to setup a best practice multilingual site using WordPress. During his talk he will cover design, content, technical, and SEO considerations, among others.

[Applause]

00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,290
[Music]

00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,750
[Applause]

00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,700
yeah so I usually talk and ramble way

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,230
too much so let's see how this goes I

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,480
might not be very successful at 12

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,040
minutes but yeah so my original talk was

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,840
going to be about how to create the

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,190
almost multilingual website a perfect

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,890
morning Google web site and we were

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,590
going to talk about the whole setting up

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,510
process and detailed Wakaba blah that's

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,430
not going to happen in 12 minutes so I'm

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,260
gonna kind of just go quite quickly

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,300
through some of the key things that over

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,640
the years I've come across and noticed

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,109
that always sort of people either other

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,669
people seem to miss or that we have

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,590
experienced in our company missing

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,590
things there hopefully you can learn

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,870
from and try and take back and not do

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,809
the same mistakes as we do so a little

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,379
bit about me because I'm that important

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,660
not really um I'm a bit weird first of

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,059
all um why do I sort of have this big

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,559
interest in multilingual websites the

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,899
issue is pretty well the reason is

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,899
basically this I'm originally from New

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,120
Zealand I then lived in Argentina and

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,510
then I went to Australia for about six

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,129
years and then I came to Finland after

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,159
spending a few months living in Uganda

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,070
doing some stuff for UNICEF so I've got

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,260
a bit of a weird background experience

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,970
in different countries where people do

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,710
speak English people don't people have

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,840
more than one language in their country

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,189
and things like that so for me this is

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,070
quite a passionate thing because I also

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,979
have in four of those countries have the

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,780
experience of being someone living there

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,750
but who doesn't necessarily speak the

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,340
language and the frustration of trying

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,049
to find your way around things if that's

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,159
my details if you want to stalk me or

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,650
ask me questions because we don't have

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,590
questions today and so this get started

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,899
sir content stuff so when we're doing a

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,329
multilingual website

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,280
think about as I said before if you

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,140
value the person's visit value their

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,939
language if it's someone that you think

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,890
is you're going to get something out of

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,259
as a customer or just as a user in

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,810
general you probably should have content

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,700
in their language

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,680
but then there's this wonderful thing

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,470
that people often tend to do mainly in

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,040
Finland but in also other countries is

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:14,400
briefly in Lang don't do it ever not

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,470
even ever it is the most offensive thing

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,750
almost you may not realize it but it

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,950
just makes you feel degraded for the

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,660
Finns in the room if you've been on

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,280
Finnair recently and you've noticed that

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,590
they've started swapping the language of

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,910
the videos so now it has everything in

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,430
English and then it has us briefly and

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,110
finished I would be really offended

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,450
being like hey this is my flag carrier

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,890
and you're telling me in five and five

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,130
seconds what you told everyone else in

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,840
three minutes you clearly value me so it

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,260
really kind of knocks the user down a

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,860
bit

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm from the start so when we talk about

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,510
the content you want to keep the key

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,310
content in sync so that means if you

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,770
have a big website with a blog with news

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,810
etc etc you don't have to have

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,700
everything translated by any means but

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,200
make sure that the key information that

00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,910
someone might need to know about your

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,980
company about your organization about

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,920
your event make sure that that's

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,200
translated and it's correct don't leave

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,200
it so that the your main language is

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,730
correct and then you realize that your

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,800
language and your stuff in English or in

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,750
Spanish is two years behind as I found

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,950
out for an event recently where I got

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,560
the dates wrong because they hadn't

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,970
updated their thing in two years um so

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,920
keep it in sync because if you translate

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,480
it then people will come if people go to

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,010
your website and they don't see that

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,620
their language is there and they maybe

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,720
expect to they're not going to bother if

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,060
you actually translate it people are

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,739
obviously funnily enough more likely to

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,239
go and say oh yeah okay I'm gonna go to

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,950
Europe and I'm gonna work with your

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,800
company I'm gonna do this I'm going to

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,140
do that

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,480
and consider your resources though so at

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,430
the end of this yes it would be lovely

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,100
to have a million languages and do this

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,290
and that but be realistic about what the

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,720
resources you have in you know your

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,880
organization or company or whatever if

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,650
you can't afford to translate into four

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,500
languages then don't pick the two that

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,970
are most important and sort of go from

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,070
there and do it right or don't do it at

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,250
all so kind of going back to the thing

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,290
about this life briefly in whatever

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,000
language if you're not going to

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,070
translate the key stuff properly and

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,570
actually put the effort in then I would

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,310
say even don't bother at all because

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,740
you're just gonna start providing this

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,540
information frustrating people with bad

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,310
user experience and that content and

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,660
it's just you're gonna end up having

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,280
people walk away from you with a bad

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:37,850
experience speaking of experience user

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,050
experience and user interface things so

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,940
things that these are things that you

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,370
should think about with with the design

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,470
and with the layout of your site so how

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,750
are people going to find their language

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,130
you may think this is a pretty obvious

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,500
thing like yes there's a thing in the

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,480
corner but you'd be surprised a lot of

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,100
websites I've come across you have to

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,410
dig into the menu especially on a mobile

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,970
and it's actually really hard to find

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,620
how to switch your language and then you

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,820
just go well they don't have my language

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,960
I'm gonna leave the website I don't care

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,630
I don't have I don't have time this is

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,840
always a fun one do you auto detect the

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,840
website based on their browser language

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,970
yeah

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,880
it's a useful feature but you have to

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,440
think of the market you're in Finland

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
has a weird thing in particular where a

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,010
lot of people's computers are either in

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
English or their browsers are actually

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,600
set to English so they will be

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,220
redirected first to the English page

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,980
even if they're going to a site that has

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,350
finished language so you just have to

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,060
really think about that also there's

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,160
sort of weird situations that are

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,570
becoming more common that this comes

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,430
down to locale codes if you don't know

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,620
what a locale code is please Google it

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,060
look it up read about it because they're

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,440
actually very important with with

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,410
multilingual websites but essentially

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240
if your site says that your if you're a

00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,740
sweepin and you have your computer in

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,810
Swedish but it's but you've said that

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,590
you're living in Finland your locale

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,240
code will be SB underscore fi and very

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,060
few country a very few websites will

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,340
probably have that as a language set in

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,510
their website in Finland you might if

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,300
that's means set up correctly we'll come

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,340
to that in a moment but often it's

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,170
better to actually sort of give the use

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,700
of the chance at the very start to

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,960
select their language but it just

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,760
depends you have to think about the user

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,250
base yeah this kind of comes back to

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,390
that sort of points well if you come

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,950
from Google or if you come from

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,560
somewhere and you get sent to the wrong

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,720
language how easy is it for the person

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,880
to find out that a do you have this

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,980
content in their language and B how do

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,870
you get there again when you have to dig

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,000
into mobile menus like for ages and ages

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,950
just to change your language it becomes

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
frustrating depending on your needs you

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,500
might have something down the bottom

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,910
that says hey this article or this

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,670
content is also available in these

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,780
languages or you know there's many

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,310
different ways but that's something you

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,380
should think about how do you deal with

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:05,700
that situation yeah my favorite no flags

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:10,240
ever like ever

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,790
unless you're showing your country it's

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,320
just I mean yeah it gets here I always

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,050
like to use the example of Finland you

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,210
know you have two three languages so

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,900
what what language of does the Finnish

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,160
flag actually represent a lot of people

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,290
probably here would say it's Finnish

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,890
okay Swedish has their own flag that's

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:34,390
fine sami well that's a good question

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,830
but when you go to a global site so it's

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,480
not actually a site that's really got

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,470
information specific to a country but

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,030
it's a global site if you put the US

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,070
flag as English

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm from New Zealand I speak English

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,890
that's not my flag not my president so

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,320
you know you've got to think about this

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,870
sort of thing so I would always

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,700
recommend don't use flags

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,010
unless you are really saying ok this

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,010
content is for this region of the world

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,860
technical stuff so these are some things

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,020
that you might need to look out for and

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,280
most of this has handed by plugins but

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,770
there are a few things you should be

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,090
aware of and this is more about testing

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,900
and checking at the end of sort of

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,340
developing a site so is your locale

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,260
right so before I said about the issue

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:27,440
with for example sort of sweet ferns and

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,420
and sort of Swedish from Finland because

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,110
a locale yes there are certain set

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,210
locales but you have it does affect

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,430
where your browser is reader or with

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,669
your site sort of loads based on your

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,960
browser if you use that also Google has

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,150
some stuff to do with that they'll be

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,410
checking so they'll way actually

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,180
presenting certain content if you've got

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,270
lots of different languages based on

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,090
your H riff of H bang no href Lang yeah

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,560
H hreflang tags there's a lot of

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,970
technical stuff in there that that

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,130
Google and other search engines use to

00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,960
identify the correct content for the

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,030
users who are searching for it so you

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,310
need to get that right the problem with

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:10,250
this is that and again going to use the

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,020
Swedish from Finland example when you if

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,320
you go on to say Polly Lang and you put

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,420
in the locale code which will then use

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,810
to pull the language files or WordPress

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,370
we use to pull the language files

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,640
there's I don't think there's a Swedish

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,590
Finnish translation is there nope

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,970
exactly so it's gonna take the Swedish

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,230
one sir I sorry it's not going to take

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,300
the Swedish one though so it's gonna say

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,850
err this doesn't exist so you go cool

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,470
I'll change it to se unjust go ahead SV

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,200
underscore se which is for Swedish

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,850
Swedish from Sweden but then you're

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,500
giving the wrong locale code in your HOA

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,050
flying tags and then you're going to

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,700
redirect people wrong that's something

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,960
you have to sort out manually I think

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,990
that's something that WordPress one day

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,040
might want to work out how to fix to let

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,520
you kind of set things but that's

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,560
another story

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,110
but yeah check those locale codes that's

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,300
really really important

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,560
does your theme even internationalize or

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,500
localize so these days I think this is

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,880
less and less of an issue but just

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,740
making sure that especially if you're

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,170
developing custom themes or custom

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,970
plugins even debt you set the stuff up

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,540
correctly so it can actually translated

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,540
even by yourself

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,060
and then look at tools now we just were

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,899
told that loco translate is not that

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,350
great apparently okay I think it's a

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,750
good tool for using when your clients

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,459
want to translate things so it's great

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,139
you can use poet as a you know as an

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,569
agency or as a developer just to do this

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,600
but if your clients want to actually

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,009
change certain translations this can be

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,709
useful it could also be something that

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,759
you possibly kind of put there let them

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,550
do their stuff and then take it away

00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,680
later local translates actually backed

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,139
by a company which calls themself

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,639
localized biz I think which actually

00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,290
have a big they actually have like a

00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,449
whole full-on interface for translating

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,670
apps and all sorts of things which is

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,740
something that we actually use on some

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,899
projects which is another option and you

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,100
can also get the same effect of giving

00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:11,240
your clients the ability to translate

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:13,949
things if I want to I told you I ramble

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,930
accessibility so for the most part again

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:20,459
this is taken care of by plugins but

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:24,209
just check that if you're using them are

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:27,180
you using flags please don't

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:29,009
if you are flags aren't particularly

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,860
accessible if you have issues with

00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:34,470
seeing colors they can mess things up so

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,540
make sure that you've got the right text

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,860
and information there and make sure that

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,630
it's readable I would say that it's much

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,750
easier to identify a language from a

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:47,329
word that it is from a flag

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,190
SEO stuff pretty simple choose a

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,649
structure that's standardized I would

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,740
say that makes sense and this also comes

00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:56,269
to user experience side of things that

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,949
users can understand what what's going

00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,750
on with where they are in your website

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:01,519
so whether you have Lang country and

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,990
language or just language then to

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:10,579
understand watch out for unlock lies

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,899
strings just they pop up everywhere it

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,060
trust me so just make sure you do a good

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,149
check of your website you have the title

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,720
in the title bar gone and country

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,610
domains when you do like Google search

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,690
console check through those because you

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,459
need to set this to the stuff up

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,579
correctly that's something you need to

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:31,220
do specifically but this is something

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,079
that Google halves of redefined it used

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,660
to be that a dot fi would be focused on

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:39,050
Finland that doesn't matter anymore

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,420
they've now changed this so now a dot F

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,279
I it can be sort of localized but though

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,170
if you put sort of Swedish content or

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,279
Norwegian content that's target at those

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,940
countries they're not going to penalize

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,399
you in search results and you get Google

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,410
search console things got an equivalent

00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:01,040
so there you have all that everything

00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:02,600
set up I think yeah are these the key

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,190
things though make sure that what you're

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,139
doing is helping your users find things

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,000
and understand how your site works don't

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,589
skimp on content and before you release

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,209
something just check your setup actually

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,540
works and does things the way it's

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:17,510
supposed to if you have questions ask me

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,790
later or you can tweet at me I usually

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,950
rant on Twitter so they start with my

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,999
tweets or email me thank you very much

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,999
[Applause]

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,140
Thank You Thomas I kind of I already

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,300
knew that why you are talking

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,279
multilingual sites because you really

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:45,480
know your stuff so please keep on

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,580
rambling around with DOS issue yeah we

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,770
because it's pretty common nowadays that

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,970
you actually build multilingual websites

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:58,000
anyways so it's really important that

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:01,870
things right especially here yeah and I

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,120
assume that elsewhere also we are not

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,670
going to have a big break now but if you

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,670
