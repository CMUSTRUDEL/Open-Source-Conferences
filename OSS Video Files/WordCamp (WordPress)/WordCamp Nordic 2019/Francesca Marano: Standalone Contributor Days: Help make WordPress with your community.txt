Title: Francesca Marano: Standalone Contributor Days: Help make WordPress with your community
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	The Italian WordPress community was dormant for years, until a bunch of people got together at WCEU Contributor Day in Seville, in 2015, and decided it was time to revive it.
After months of online chats in our Slack team, we organised an event that kick-started an avalanche of Meetups and WordCamps in Italy: a stand-alone Contributor Day.
Four years later, Italy has more than 30 active Meetups, 6 cities with WordCamps in planning stages, and a great number of Contributors across the project.
In this talk, Iâ€™ll go through the steps we took to organise it and I will also talk about Contributor Nights, special Meetup events where we concentrate on one of the Make teams and learn how to contribute from scratch.
