Title: Francesca Marano: Standalone Contributor Days: Help make WordPress with your community
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	The Italian WordPress community was dormant for years, until a bunch of people got together at WCEU Contributor Day in Seville, in 2015, and decided it was time to revive it.
After months of online chats in our Slack team, we organised an event that kick-started an avalanche of Meetups and WordCamps in Italy: a stand-alone Contributor Day.
Four years later, Italy has more than 30 active Meetups, 6 cities with WordCamps in planning stages, and a great number of Contributors across the project.
In this talk, Iâ€™ll go through the steps we took to organise it and I will also talk about Contributor Nights, special Meetup events where we concentrate on one of the Make teams and learn how to contribute from scratch.

yeah okay so usually I talk about my

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,519
failures this time it's a success

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,849
doesn't happy ending so that's great I

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,130
think it's better than here how bad I

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,550
was at being an entrepreneur which is

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,970
usually the talk that I do so my name is

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,289
Francesca and from Torino Italy and I'm

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,180
the workers community manager at

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,269
SiteGround international web hosting

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,800
company giving back to WordPress is

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,759
basically part of my job description

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,430
which is pretty cool and I travel to

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,380
conferences and I do what one of the

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,540
things that I love the most in life

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,800
which is sharing knowledge

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,809
I believe we shouldn't go to our and

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,550
with keeping our knowledge inside for

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,129
ourselves but share it as much as

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,050
possible and I think we all agree

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,379
because we're here for open source right

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,410
so sometimes I say I share my

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,620
experiences or my failures most of the

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,369
time and sometimes from the collective

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,460
knowledge of my talented cybron team my

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,890
role in the WordPress community includes

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,250
an active participation in the community

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,009
team where I support local organizers

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,290
from around the world plan their events

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,110
and strengthen their WordPress community

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,479
and groups so if you need help

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,670
ping me please I love doing that if

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,090
there's a work camp in the making that

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,630
needs a mentor I'm available and that's

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,700
exactly how I heard about work in Nordic

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,560
one year ago at work in Palo where the

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,200
organizers from all this wonderful

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,420
country had a round table and they spoke

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,310
about organizing this event so I'm very

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,780
very honored you pick my talk because I

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,850
know you picked mostly Nordic country

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,220
countries people so as I say this is a

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,619
personal story it has a happy ending and

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,290
we're going to talk about how your

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,390
community can help make WordPress and

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,450
how making WordPress can help your

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,060
community grow it's a it goes both ways

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,819
and we're going to do so by using the

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,500
Italian community as an example

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:14,310
so there's a before and after before

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,340
2015 the situation was not very happy or

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,410
positive this was what was going on

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,360
there were two meetups there were a few

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,760
word camps actually it was one of the

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,879
first countries that had word camps in

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,580
2008 but it was before where Kim central

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,099
was invented so it was kind of hard to

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,040
keep the continuity because there wasn't

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,190
much support so it really relied on you

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,900
know individual efforts also

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,540
translations relied on individual effort

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,459
it was like a the smallest team ever and

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,190
they somehow managed to release

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:52,400
WordPress in Italian at every release

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:55,079
but it was honestly a one-man show and

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,019
the forum's were outside of IP

00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:01,530
wordpress.org so in brief we didn't

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,930
really identify as a community and for

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,090
sure we didn't identify as a community a

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,569
local community part of an international

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,530
global one and then that's 2015 and

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,780
after that everything changed this is

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,810
the situation now in Italy it's not true

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,850
there are more marks I don't know how

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,750
you call those a signpost I'm just very

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:28,019
lazy doing this takes a lot of time so

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,840
this is when we had about 20 meetups now

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,940
we have a 34 and Counting

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,959
I have at least three in the vetting

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,500
queue to to work with we had two word

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,959
comes in 2016 we had the six last year

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,040
and we're in March we already have a 5

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,950
in pre-planning for 2019 we have more

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,680
than 2000 people translating WordPress

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,049
that's the group the contributor group

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,720
that we call polyglots and the forums

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,519
are now part of ID dot wordpress.org so

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,940
they're in Italian and we have an active

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,650
team dealing with that very dedicated to

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,079
voltages so how did we get here because

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,739
this is pretty impressive I mean it'll

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,739
is a big country

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,180
but it's not like a massive country all

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,560
right and then we also have the language

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,150
barrier that we will not talk about

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
today because we don't have time but

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,950
that was a big problem for us

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,110
so a number of things happened at the

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,600
same time first of all in this lovely

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,360
graphic you'll see how the rise of the

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,600
overall work impressed you that I really

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,780
need a graphic to do my well mine like

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,250
the overall WordPress usage reason for

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,860
everyone and the platform has been

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,940
growing steadily since 2003 as you know

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,830
and this also obviously helped everyone

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,060
the creation of work in Europe here with

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:54,110
this original Leiden logo in 2013

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,600
started a big shift in how communities

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,950
organize themselves and how they

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,410
exchanged information with other

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,570
countries and other communities and

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,560
learned from each other and as Marco

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,030
said this morning

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:14,460
parrot know of Paris was the point where

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,140
you all met Vienna yet that's where the

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,900
idea started for us it started in

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:25,680
Seville in 2015 so that's the proof that

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:27,780
work in Europe works there were a few

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,110
Italians there their method contributed

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,270
data discussed as you can imagine and

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,650
they decided to create a community we

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,480
didn't really know what the community

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,550
was but okay it sounded good so we're

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,500
gonna do this and the community would be

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,850
global and local at the same time

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,630
because why not so after they came back

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:50,940
they open a slack work space and in

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,190
Italian and that's where we started

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,140
chatting you can imagine how much we

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,710
charted you know the free slack account

00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:02,550
has 10,000 messages free we reach that

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,370
like every month because we do chat a

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,170
lot and we started making plans and we

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,670
started dreaming let's do work and let's

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,860
do a meet-up let's to work in fear

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,080
applets to work in word whatever we want

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,970
to do it all so we spent a few months

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,270
getting to know each other online and

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,960
then we decided it was time to meet in

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:25,229
person and honestly we didn't know much

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,160
about any of this so where do we start

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:32,280
from at the meetups started at this

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,560
point we went from 2 to 8 from 8 to 10

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,190
and stuff like that so we decided to

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,190
organize an event whose format is not as

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,680
popular as I think it should be but

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,960
hopefully we will see more of those and

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
it was a crucial point for our community

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,470
so we organized the standalone

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,650
contributor day we came from all over

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:59,550
Europe we had 90 people sign up which

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,009
was an amazing number and we met in

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,229
Milano to work side by side for the

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:10,590
whole day for most of us it was the

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:11,880
first time contributing to anything some

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,280
of us didn't really know what

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,800
open-source was but it found that cool

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,979
we went people came from Sicily which is

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,590
like 1500 kilometers from there so

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,570
people were really committed to this we

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,240
focused on a few teams as you can see

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:30,300
the ones for which we had the people

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,610
that could support us get us started and

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,380
you know point us into the right

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,729
direction let's do just a quick show of

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,949
hands because maybe I'm talking about

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,800
something that you don't all know how

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,630
many of you didn't come to contributor

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,430
day yesterday you were in there

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:55,610
yesterday okay keep your hands up

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:59,060
because I'm I am you know I am

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,590
how many of you didn't come because you

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,020
thought it was just about the code oh

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,030
man you're good ouu you didn't come

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,490
because you didn't know it was about the

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,430
card okay so you're very advanced for

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,919
you I'm sorry you didn't come because it

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,620
was you thought it was about the code

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,120
because the truth is that this is what a

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,009
contributor day as we define it in the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,139
contributor in the community team

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,120
handbook so contributor days are for

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,009
everyone on ever experienced level and

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,570
even see someone who knows very little

00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,289
about WordPress can contribute to

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,820
answering support questions and more so

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,760

so organizing it was very exciting of

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,940
course challenging but very exciting

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,160
today we have basically our time here is

because I'm very passionate about this

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,690
because I saw the results and I really

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,970
wish more local communities would go

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,580
through this these are the exact steps

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,529
we took to organize our free day so

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,529
first of all wise find a room with free

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:28,520
with Wi-Fi possibly a free room so we

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:33,920
asked everyone we finally found a mazing

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,510
venue free and it made sense it was in

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,400
milano it made sense it was free

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,910
Milano's easy to reach from all over

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,790
Italy so it made sense organize food and

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,270
coffee don't do as we did italians are

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:51,560
obsessed with food we talked about food

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,290
more than anything else for that event

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,750
so this is not where you follow what we

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,480
did you go your way if you're a small

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,790
group you take food from home and it's

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,070
fantastic if you are a bigger group you

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,430
ask a sponsor and if it's within a

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,950
reasonable price I'm sure someone

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,170
like to help you we told everyone about

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,730
this now I don't know if you know that

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,330
your locale your WordPress installation

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,149
in your country so sv wordpress.org and

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,390
oh we're pressed org fi wordpress.org

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:25,420
they come with the blog you can switch

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:28,570
that blog so instead of feeding the

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:32,320
Global News inside dashboards you can

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,149
feed the news from your blog so this is

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,270
how we got people because suddenly they

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:40,510
saw news in Italian in their dashboard

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,339
and finally Thank You page yes we had an

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,100
Jenni if she's here we had help from

00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,959
Mentors now this is not a must-have but

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,600
I have to say it helped us a lot

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,480
so mentors are people that have already

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,330
some experience with that particular

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,339
team and there were very generous they

00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,290
came from abroad they helped us get us

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,290
this started and obviously it was much

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:07,180
easier to have someone tell us death

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:10,779
instead of go look into the handbook so

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,339
Italy today welcome to Reno 2016 which

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,260
was the first where camp in three years

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,050
in Italy sent the applications for the

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,790
first word camp there this picture is at

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:23,020
the end of contribute today we had about

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,640
100 people on a 250 word camp so the

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:30,850
culture of contribution in Italy is very

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,890
high support for years the support

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,170
forums were in an external website and

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,200
then the moment we decide we are

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,630
becoming a community we switched and we

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,990
started using the forums that come with

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,339
your locale as well they started working

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,020
in the summer but it's during

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,029
contributor day that they really gained

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,829
momentum and they got more people to

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,180
contribute it's an amazing team and I

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,650
don't know how they do it but basically

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,570
they have never unanswered stuff

00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,630
polyglots the translators went to be

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,270
from a individual effort to a very big

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,610
group of people we have mentorship where

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,950
procedures will have everything you want

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,170
and I'm very proud to say that for three

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,420
years Italy at

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,650
actively the global translation day if

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,110
you don't know what the global

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,390
translation day is please look it up

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,490
there's gonna be one on the 11th of May

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,740
and it's very important because this is

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,650
how we reach more people with our

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:33,100
beloved WordPress so please look it up

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,650
and this is full circle so finally after

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,250
two days the two years almost to the day

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,200
of hard work we came full circle I love

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,040
this picture this is just a small part

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,020
of the Italians that were in Paris in

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,570
2017 in 2013 there were about three

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,000
Italians at work in Europe in Paris who

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,300
were a hundred in Belgrade probably more

00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,660
and Berlin get ready because the

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:05,350
Italians are coming like a lot of so

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,390
this is something that I like to say

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,540
taking part in a contribute today is

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,250
what helped us become a community and as

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,920
a community we're very happy to be part

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,060
of the global project that helps make

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,060
work for us for everyone thank you

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,060
