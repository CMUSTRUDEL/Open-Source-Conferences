Title: Rian Rietveld: Who’s afraid of ARIA?
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	WAI-ARIA means Accessible Rich Internet Applications. These are attributes you add to your HTML5 to (for example) inform blind visitors what is happening on your site.
How do you use ARIA and why? And why is the first rule of ARIA: “Don’t use ARIA”?
In this talk Rian will show you how to
    announce changes and error messages
    use the JavaScript function wp.a11y.speak()
    tell if a menu or accordion is closed or open
    give feedback on what’s happening on a one page website
    get the right documentation and examples
Discover that ARIA isn’t that complicated and is very useful for those visitors that use your site in another way than you do.
