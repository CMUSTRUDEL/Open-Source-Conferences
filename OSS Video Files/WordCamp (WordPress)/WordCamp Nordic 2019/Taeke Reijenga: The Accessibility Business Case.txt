Title: Taeke Reijenga: The Accessibility Business Case
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	This talk looks at the business side of web accessibility. Awareness around accessibility and inclusivity is increasing in the WordPress ecosystem but how can you as a designer, developer, or agency (owner) get the message across to your client? As makers of the web we often have to deal with myths like ‘accessible web design is ugly or boring’, ‘web accessibility is expensive and hard to implement’ and ‘my site audience does not include disabled people’. This talk looks at the WHY of Web Accessibility and provides the audience with HOW. HOW to convince your client that there are many benefits with having an accessible website.

my name is taka raha I only full-service

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,090
WordPress agency in the Netherlands in

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,590
Rotterdam and often when talking about

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,130
accessibility to our clients

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,100
I used the SEO argument are you aware of

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,119
that argument

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,600
it basically says just you know if

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,970
Google is blind and we create a

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,880
networking cool things Google is blind

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,430
it's the biggest blind user on earth on

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,600
planet earth basically so if we make our

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:40,140
website more accessible and indexable by

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,489
that we're basically the profits both

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,520
both accessibility and SEO but the more

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,370
I was using this this argument to

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,129
towards clients I was feeling that I was

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,750
kind of cheating them or thinking is

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,510
this really the best that we can come up

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,539
with is this argument strong enough to

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,309
build a case on and make them spend a

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,799
bit more money a bit more time on a

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:11,330
accessible project so what is web

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,890
accessibility and why is it important

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,229
looking at the different word camps and

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,830
also outside of word camps outside our

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,570
WordPress ecosystem you see that

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,909
awareness around accessibility is

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,040
growing there's more people talking

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,210
about it there's more talks about it but

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,140
what are we really talking about here

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:36,119
according to the World Wide Web

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,060
Consortium w3c web accessibility means

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,729
that websites tools and technologies are

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,630
designed and developed so that people

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,530
with disabilities can use them so we're

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,530
talking about people with disabilities

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:59,579
using the web what does that mean then

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,619
what what does it mean for them to use

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,780
the web with a disability what how does

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,680
it impact their experience how many

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,950
people are talking about in this talk I

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,080
will go into some numbers to illustrate

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,880
on the amount of people that we're

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,610
talking about

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,250
and also the potential of this group of

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,770
people there's a lot of numbers in here

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,320
we're going to do some math together I

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,430
put all the resources I used in the last

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,240
slides so please just sit back relax and

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:35,390
let me do my talk so when looking for a

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,250
definition of disability I found out

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,300
it's quite hard to come up with one one

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,140
definition that tells me a bit about the

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,670
scope the statistical definition differs

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,080
and operational definitions differ

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,230
something I found really interesting too

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,480
to find one in this bit of research is

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,900
the so called medical theory theoretical

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,520
model of accessibility and the social

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:08,900
theoretical model of disability the

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,510
first one says disability is a

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,280
restriction of ability to perform an

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,160
activity in the manner or within the

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,220
range considered normal for a human

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,400
being

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,660
disabilities are descriptions of

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,170
disturbances in function of the level of

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,600
the person this model basically looks at

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,290
a disability as the problem that belongs

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,390
to the disabled person it's not seen as

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,040
something that concerns society or

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,920
anybody else than the individual

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,870
affected and this is evidenced by the

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,000
World Health Organization's

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,760
definition of 1980 the second model

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,310
which came after what after that the

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,260
social theoretical model said there's a

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,480
recognition within the social model that

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,750
there's a great deal that society can do

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,940
to reduce and ultimately remove some of

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,480
these disabling barriers and that this

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:09,350
task is the responsibility of society

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:13,070
rather than the disabled person so

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,890
basically saying that through designing

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,080
everything to meet the needs of the

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,060
average or what is considered normal the

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,320
majority of people that are not disabled

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,320
we are basically adding barriers to

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,810
people with a disability

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,390
the social model recognizes that there's

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:37,120
a lot that society can do to remove

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:40,600
these barriers fortunately there's a bit

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,430
more w3c is also there's a web

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,820
accessibility initiative and there's a

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,290
whole section on their website that goes

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,020
a bit further than the definition that

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:54,130
we just saw this was the original

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,890
definition I came up with telling that

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,960
it's about people with disabilities

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:04,150
using the web but it continues and

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,970
specifies this a bit more it is about

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,740
people accessibility is about people

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,110
being able to perceive understand

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,820
navigate and interact in the web and

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,580
even contribute to the web it continues

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,700
to mention different types of

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,810
disabilities that may prevent access to

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:33,190
the web or affected disabilities like

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:37,750
auditory cognitive neurological speech

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:42,690
physical or visual or any combination of

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,610
those what's important to note is that

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,460
we're not just talking about people with

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,250
these disabilities it also benefits

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,730
people without disabilities some

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,630
examples are people using mobile phones

00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:01,030
or other types of screens and devices

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:05,590
older people their needs change due to

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,420
aging we all have temporary disabilities

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,110
maybe you break an arm you lose your

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,510
glasses something like that or what

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,520
about bright sunlight you're trying to

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,790
get some work done and suddenly the Sun

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,430
hits the screen or being in a full train

00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,590
commuting to work you want to watch a

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,570
video but it doesn't proper offer

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:31,180
subtitles it's the only audio there's a

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,880
really cool playlist on web

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,440
accessibility perspectives and I was

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,440
taught to shut up about this place

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,810
so there's a full playlist on YouTube on

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,960
different short videos like 45 seconds

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,810
maybe a minute where you see sort of the

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,080
overlap between situational disabilities

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,740
medical disabilities and maybe growing

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,880
older and just changing needs this is

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,660
also shared at the end of the

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,360
presentation and in the references okay

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,370
so you know we kind of know who you know

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,890
who's impacted who were doing this for

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,540
what we're talking about that makes me

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,510
wonder how many people are we talking

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,250
about how big is this scope are we doing

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,260
this for the few people that we

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,290
personally know that maybe are blind

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,770
deaf or in a wheelchair or something or

00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,560
is that number a bit bigger than that

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,160
again because definitions differ it's

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,220
hard to come up with just really factual

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:08,790
numbers to use and World Bank mentions 1

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,080
billion people worldwide or about 50

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:15,660
percent of the global population

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,630
European Union comes up with slightly

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,370
different numbers a bit higher even they

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:26,750
predict 120 million EU citizens to be

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,500
impacted by 2020 or having a disability

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:34,020
which is 20% or more than 20% of the EU

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,820
population that's 20% of the people I

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,450
see here in this room now there's quite

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,150
a chunk so this tells us a bit about the

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,460
why for accessibility we're did not just

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,710
just doing this for those 20% we're

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,310
doing this for you and me and maybe our

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:54,060
grandparents or parents do I want to see

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,030
some hands who here in this room agrees

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,160
with me that web accessibility should be

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,390
the bare minimum of any web project web

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,950
project that we take on but there's a

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,360
lot more than I expected or than the

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,660
notes that I have here but I would say

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,750
that's about 70 75 percent of you here

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:16,350
agrees that Whitney so we can make a

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,320
deal then let's make a deal here and now

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,270
you and me that we are gonna teach our

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,440
clients on the importance of web

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,300
accessibility

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,240
that the next project that we're going

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,339
to take on is going to be a little bit

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,620
more accessible than the last one that

00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,899
we did it doesn't need to be perfect

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,110
immediately it's more important to make

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:42,240
the steps and get there and keep it in

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:45,120
mind when working on a project so with

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,680
every project we deliver we'll try to be

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:57,509
better improve accessibility for all

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:59,730
agree Hey okay some years ago we start

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,959
inspired by Arianna actually I was

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,149
sitting here in the front and doing an

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,699
amazing talk later today inspired by

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,430
Rihanna on a couple of work camps in the

00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:10,800
past as an agency we started telling our

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,019
clients we find this is the bare minimum

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,079
of a web project like SEO that they're

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,420
all asking for like performance like

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,779
security it should be there it should be

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,160
part of the foundation of a project but

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,230
they also experienced and when talking

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,160
to clients and I also mean potential

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:33,149
clients then that just as SEO argument

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:36,149
is not always solid enough you know the

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,800
higher the number the more math they're

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,660
doing and in the back of the room

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,560
thinking hey this is a good deal is that

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,139
not a good deal so I started

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,740
investigating numbers a bit let's try to

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,180
see if I can convince our future client

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,880
and what's important to note is that

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,230
with a business case this is about

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,130
either money or risk so you should be

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,730
thinking does it somehow increase income

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:09,290
money coming in does something in this

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:13,410
case accessibility save us money somehow

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:19,680
or does it help us mitigate risk maybe

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:21,600
we can keep away from lawsuits and

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
what's really important here is that you

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,399
investigate your client try to

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,800
understand their business and keep

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,959
asking questions don't just deal with

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,000
the answer they give you but keep asking

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,649
questions try to interview their

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,080
audience try to get a deep understanding

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,570
of their base

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,270
is what their gains are what their

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:47,090
threats are what opportunities are be

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:50,150
sure that you're prepared and I have a

00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,310
little bit of a math a little case here

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:56,240
that we're gonna go through to show you

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:59,030
how this can work let's say there's a

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,680
web shop owner that you get in touch

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,510
with somehow maybe here in this word

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,760
camp and he tells you about this Web

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,810
shop doing a hundred thousand visitors

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,360
per month sales are no okay they're

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:16,070
pretty good average order value seventy

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,660
five euros per quarter and after talking

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,150
a bit you know you find out the web site

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:24,230
is quite old it could use some changes

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,070
and you agree on writing a proposal to

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,770
redo the whole thing

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,400
design development just the whole

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,590
installation but of course this client

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,410
is gonna ask you be nice be gentle

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,190
you know the excuses maybe another

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,440
developer already use the budget or well

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,170
times are tough and you know we don't

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,900
have too much money available but we do

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,320
want to take on this project so you go

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,080
home

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,750
start writing your proposal crunching

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,420
numbers thinking okay let's you know

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,120
shave offs on the design hours let's

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,880
take away some project management who

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,440
needs that anyways you know maybe

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,190
development can be a bit of a little bit

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,770
more agile than normally and then you

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,660
realize we just made a deal here every

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,510
project that we were gonna take on was

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:19,250
gonna be more accessible than the one we

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:24,050
did before so accessibility is suddenly

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:28,880
part of this proposal as well so let's

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,720
say we're gonna add some design hours to

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,000
this proposal make sure that you quote

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,430
enough design hours to have someone look

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,530
at color contrasts and let someone look

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,050
at the style guide that your client is

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,610
providing to you maybe make sure that

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,470
the design is appealing it should look

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,660
good for anybody that can see this

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,810
website it should look good

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,519
development wise it kind of depends if

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,079
it's all new to you make sure that you

00:13:52,519 --> 00:14:00,380
you know add some hours for

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:02,120
investigation for learning add an an le

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,269
audit so there's an accessibility audit

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,699
try to get someone in to help you with

00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,800
that to kind of validate your work maybe

00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,019
you have some edge case scenarios that

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,660
you need help with maybe using a plug-in

00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:19,970
of which the output is not really

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:22,490
accessible and this one is often

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,790
forgotten and that is training the staff

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,680
train your client and their users tray

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,290
or not their user sorry they're their

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,440
employees so whoever is working on

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,120
content train them as well it's not just

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,610
about the process of going through this

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,860
webshop and adding products and dealing

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,259
with orders it's also about writing

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,250
content that can be read and understood

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,980
by anyone

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,050
make sure there's alt text on images

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,509
eBay is doing a really cool job with

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,490
that they have a call to action in a lot

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:58,730
of the product images also okay then you

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,680
realize this is not one of those cheap

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:07,910
offers that your client was asking for

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,949
but we were prepared we know that this

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,380
client has hundred thousand visitors per

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:16,189
month we also know that the average

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:18,079
order value seventy-five euros and a bit

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,699
of googling and investigation told me

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,360
that the average conversion percentage

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:25,850
in online retail is about three percent

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,500
and it depends on the country depends on

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,380
your audience and the product of course

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:37,339
but an average of three percent is a

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:41,149
good one to to play with now we also

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:44,269
know that 71 percent of the users with a

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,880
disability so 71 percent of those twenty

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,790
percent basically will simply leave a

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,100
website that is not accessible they will

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,269
just leave probably not return to see if

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,420
you change to website in the mean time

00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:00,050
so we have hundred thousand visitors

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,639
twenty thousand

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,189
of these hundred thousand have a

00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:09,769
disability and suddenly these audience

00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:11,899
shrinks to one-third we only have 29%

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,759
left and we're just hoping that we can

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:18,350
make some money of them but what about

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:21,009
those 14200 users that came to your

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,199
website with the intent to buy something

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:28,489
with an average of 3% conversion rate

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:33,139
this means that 30 1950 euros per month

00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:34,819
is not being spent in your shop and not

00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,920
that these people closed the browser and

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:39,110
they they stop googling or whatever and

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,299
they think well no sneakers for me they

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,949
just go to your competitor's website a

00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:49,009
competitor that has a accessible website

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:53,239
it's a freaking 32,000 euros per month

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:57,529
that's just dare and we're not it's not

00:16:53,239 --> 00:17:00,290
for us it's for the competitors and this

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:03,529
amazes me there are so many companies

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:07,250
hiring SEO consultants or conversion

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:09,439
optimization specialists or somehow

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,079
clients all know that one second of

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,020
delay in in Amazon costs them 1.6

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,939
billion dollars or something like that

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,909
but they have no freaking clue about

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:21,709
what huge audience is kind of walking

00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:23,230
away from their website when you're

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,610
talking about accessibility

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,339
this is three hundred eighty four

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:33,070
thousand euros per year that you could

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,210
have had in your pocket F extra revenue

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,880
there's two more things to take into

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,130
consideration to make this even worse

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,110
the first one the majority eighty-one

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,659
percent of these consumers will pay more

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,690
in the competitors web shop that is

00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:50,840
accessible and there's something that's

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:54,409
called the viral effect of satisfactory

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,720
online experience which kind of means

00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:58,490
that you know if you really enjoyed

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,070
shopping the area we have some really

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,960
famous examples and in the Netherlands

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,090
where the experience of buying something

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,419
and the whole you know all the steps

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,980
it's like someone is dealing with you on

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,880
a one-on-one basis like you were in a

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,760
real physical shop if that experience is

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,440
satisfying you will tell your friends

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,120
you will tell it on the birthday you

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,480
will share it online somewhere and

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,570
especially in this group of people 20%

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,080
of your target audience this is probably

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,610
happening more than just me or you on a

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,960
birthday party telling about something

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,820
you bought online for a lot of people it

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,830
means they don't leave the house and use

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,570
the internet to shop that's their main

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:46,310
way of interacting with the world so

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,470
this is one case that you can use it's

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,900
not a case for all we're not maybe not

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,730
working all on an e-commerce website but

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,530
it is a case that you can that kind of

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,020
illustrates that with numbers you can

00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,400
make the case to your client I'm pretty

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,020
sure that this client that was asking

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,510
for this cheap webshop or no be gentle

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,620
he's willing to pay for this there's

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,950
quite some money going to his

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,920
competitors and then there's some other

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,680
cases that you can find online or can

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,230
use the world world left front in Canada

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,160
they had their best fundraising year's

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:26,030
year after they launched a accessible

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,620
website 21 million dollars just by

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,300
making the website it's not just by

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,820
making the website but that what's the

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,220
annual revenue of that of those

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,710
donations so that's about getting money

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,510
from your audience and the other

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,850
business case that you can make is about

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,070
where can you save money the other

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,850
example as an S bunk in the Netherlands

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,710
created a accessible website and that

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,330
meant that the phone calls with

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,450
questions about their products and

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,790
services went down 15 to 30 % we don't

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,390
know the exact number we do know that

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,010
they had 70,000 calls per year with

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,170
people just asking the same stuff over

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:08,540
and over and over again that's saving

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:12,140
them 1.7 million euros per year that's a

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,940
valid business case I think and there is

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,520
also the risk factor and the risk factor

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:20,980
is basically about mitigating risk

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,930
depending on where you are in the world

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,550
there is some form of legacy legislation

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:29,830
around accessibility or discrimination

00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,380
so we're talking about mitigating the

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:37,900
risk or the probability of risk legal

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:41,020
risk or maybe damage to your brand one

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,150
of the earliest examples of sort of a

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,280
lawsuit that had an impact and had

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:50,380
effect is the Sydney Olympics in 2000

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:53,230
where a blank person basically went to

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,060
court and said well I'm blind and I feel

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,280
that this website is not fully

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,630
accessible to me and under the

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,340
Commonwealth Disability Discrimination

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:06,040
Act this was agreed upon by the judge

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,590
and the Sydney Olympics got three weeks

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,970
to just improve the whole website make

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,770
it made it make it accessible in the

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,590
States there's something called the ADEA

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:22,120
which is the Americans with Disabilities

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:23,860
Act the amount of lawsuits has been

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:29,610
going through the roof in the last

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:32,170
couple of years and the fines are hefty

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,420
so this is something that you should

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,220
consider as well and also depending on

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,350
where your client is if they're

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:44,890
operating in the u.s. this is something

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:47,320
to worry about I have some examples of a

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,210
DA were lawsuits most of them are being

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,830
settled between parties so we don't know

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,720
what the outcome was or what really

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:56,590
happened but what Disney for example

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,780
they declaimed

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,460
the the plaintiff said okay these sites

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,080
were overloaded with video and audio

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,670
content and for me as a disabled person

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,410
physically impaired person I cannot

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,170
switch it off I cannot deal with this

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:14,860
website and it is just horrible the

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:17,970
resolution was okay first fix it second

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,520
50,000 euros for the blind person that

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:26,140
complained and a total of 1.5 million

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,030
dollar of legal fees I don't know

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,740
but I don't have that in my pocket to

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:34,330
you know settle lawsuits and then this

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,520
is just money we're not even talking

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,530
about brand image we're talking now

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,900
about Walt Disney Company but this

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:45,490
example has been in other talks and

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:49,870
find it on the web target which is some

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,940
sort of a Walmart in the US was suit

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,720
with the claim that the the website

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,790
lacks alt text

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,430
the resolution make it work make it

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:04,350
accessible oh and by the way pays six

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:07,810
million dollars to a damages fund and

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,580
then there's HR be digital something I

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,090
never heard of but apparently it's the

00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:17,260
largest tax returns company in the US

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:19,150
and someone was telling them that the

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,460
website was incompatible with assistive

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:26,530
technologies screen readers stuff like

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,360
that so again make it work oh by the way

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,300
pay forty five thousand to the two

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,100
individuals that complained and there

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,160
was a civil penalty if fifty five

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,440
thousand and the other thing is they had

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,240
to fix this before the next text term

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,890
was their tax funding term problem in

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,070
the States is that this eighty eight

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,470
that is being used to sue companies that

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,750
have inaccessible websites and also it

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:57,970
is basically about discrimination so you

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,620
can sue for any any type of entity as

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,840
long as you feel discriminated and you

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,000
have a case and that you want to bring

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,110
to court the problem is it doesn't

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,690
provide a standard so it's basically up

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,630
to the company to kind of you know in

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,240
fear for lawsuits just try to be

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,760
accessible but there's not a set of

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,200
rules to follow and it kind of depends

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,730
on the on the users whoever feels

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,880
discriminated and can make this as a

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,820
solid case bring it to court then maybe

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,070
this was not good enough but you did

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,250
that's the big problem in in the states

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:40,660
with the ad a in Europe we have a

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:42,000
directive that was agreed upon in 2016

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,750
which is called the transnational

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,450
implementation of accessible web

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,470
standards and this directive had to be

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,250
implemented by national law so the EU

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,230
member-states

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:58,410
needed to make this into national law

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:02,549
main message being public sector bodies

00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:07,650
need to have accessible websites by the

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:10,020
end of September 2019 this year and then

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,419
you see what happens if countries are

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,059
being able to make this into their own

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,559
law that is kind of different

00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,440
perspectives and different ways of

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,390
treating us Austria public sector bodies

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,540
have been legally required to have an

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,880
accessible website starting 2016

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,390
so basically directive became law

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,210
immediately in Spain public sector

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:37,400
bodies can be fined for a poor web

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:40,679
accessibility in Italy the person

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:47,070
responsible for this public body website

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:48,990
can be sued I don't want that Norway it

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,650
goes for both public bodies and

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,840
businesses and in Switzerland it's

00:25:52,650 --> 00:26:01,200
becoming increasingly common for

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:04,200
companies to be sued under this law so

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,780
to conclude I gave you some numbers or

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,669
kind of example how to make the business

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,710
case for your client if you want to

00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:15,330
convince them that it's not just about

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:19,679
SEO or something and of course there is

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:22,290
law but personally I feel this should

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,280
not be about money this should not be

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:28,679
just about complying with the law we're

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,480
basically talking about you know you and

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,580
me we're talking about our parents or

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,360
grandparents people around us we are

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:39,059
society so although I mentioned quite

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,860
some numbers I feel that the

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:43,620
accessibility business case should not

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:48,059
be about money I feel it's just the

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:51,870
right thing to do three minutes left by

00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:54,660
the way that SEO argument is true so you

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:59,370
can still use it but you have some more

00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:03,030
material to use as well I already

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:04,940
mentioned that 430 rihanna's giving an

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,750
amazing talk if you want to dive into

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,539
area

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,929
go see that it's in circuses them two

00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:16,690
floors down I think and if you want to

slides with all the resources and links

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,929
to use where and whenever you want that

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:40,690
was it

00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:43,870
thank you talking welcome minutes for

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:52,110
for questions so raise your hand if you

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:55,840
have a question I can maybe start off

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,000
we're just thinking about the definition

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,390
maybe of disabilities and use some

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,059
numbers about percentages and sort of

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,280
broke that down the static like what

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:09,669
what is the definition of disability

00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,740
like just as an example like I'm hearing

00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:16,210
I have a hearing problems and I have a

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,549
hearing aid but I don't know if like my

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,429
hearing problem has so much to do with

00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:23,980
website websites hmm I'm not really

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,570
affected too much about that but so so

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,330
the things that you should hear like is

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,190
that what's the definition of oh well

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,220
it's basically saying that anyone that

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,960
has a the medical definition would be

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,510
that anyone that has a problem

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,610
impairment yeah that which means that

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,049
some function acts differently than what

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,929
is considered normal okay

00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:49,000
for a human yeah so even though you

00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,740
maybe don't feel it as a disability

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,450
you're completely used to it I didn't

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,549
see it I didn't hear it on the way you

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,400
spoke to me I think that goes for most

00:28:54,549 --> 00:29:00,520
people so you maybe will not consider

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,840
yourself to be disabled and it goes for

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,419
a lot of people wearing glasses for

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,520
example do you feel disabled or is it

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,770
just something that you put up in the

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,710
morning and you know put it down before

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:14,530
you got the bezel glasses and lenses if

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,630
you use that but is would that also be

00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,280
considered it would be considered under

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,490
this definition of yeah it would be

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,790
considered a disability yeah

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,750
yeah okay interesting do we have other

00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:34,440
questions raise your hand

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:36,750
question over here okay

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,880
I just wanted to ask about the font that

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,730
you used in your presentation because I

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,800
know that there are some dyslexia

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,180
friendly fonts and I could see that this

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,370
one has quite a big difference between

00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,160
for example the A's and the ease and the

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,750
numbers the way they're defined so I was

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,350
I wanted to ask if that was meant to be

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,230
a disability dyslexia friendly font I'm

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:01,380
not aware of that that we used a

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,870
dyslexia friendly font in our Brent

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,080
guide someone's waving at me

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:12,240
hi I'm not aware of this one being

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,330
specifically yeah they're like two types

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,680
of fonts like dyslexia and open dyslexic

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,650
but the thing with those phones they're

00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,120
not good for every dyslexic type so

00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,350
therefore some they're helpful but

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,840
they're not for all this like sick

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,550
helpful so you're like I would recommend

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,560
if you want to use them down use them as

00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,480
the only fun what I use them as a

00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,880
fallback phone because they also can be

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,520
really distracting for some type of

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,950
dyslexic people and for some time it's

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,070
like easier to read but it's like

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,170
complicated a little bit yeah I was not

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,270
going to go into all the details and all

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,770
the measurements that you can take to

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,070
order all the measures that you can take

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,410
to make your website accessible as young

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:56,580
and my are a lot better in explaining

00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:59,310
that I think but I'm pretty sure this

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:10,980
font is not because it's in our Brent

00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:14,120
and get the microphone so sir it's not

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,910
Aria I'm just confirmed it's not okay

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,320
other questions please raise your hand

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,320
we have a couple of more minutes

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,840
Thanks I had a question about how do you

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,870
measure in individual projects how many

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,690
persons in the target group are having

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:42,150
the disabilities because now you were

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,610
talking about the person of all people

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,710
but what about the target group yeah

00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:50,220
well that is something that sometimes

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:53,100
clients say like avid those people those

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,840
people are not in my target group or

00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,930
these people don't buy in my shop you

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,080
don't know that and that website owner

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:06,690
probably also doesn't know it Google

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,820
Analytics doesn't tell you that because

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,970
could be someone with an impairment

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,410
shopping for Christmas to give it to the

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,820
person that is considered to be the

00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:21,900
audience of this webshop so it's just

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,670
easier to make it accessible than to try

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,130
to fight it's probably more costly also

00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:30,750
to find out if this actual type is

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:32,460
within your audience or no I would skip

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,870
that part it makes it really difficult

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,410
yeah just make it accessible yeah but

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,970
because that's costing money

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,740
yeah well that's interesting to note I

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,660
only had 30 minutes in my talk so I had

00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,000
to take out some slides and one of them

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:51,030
is the the cost of making a website

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
accessible and we as an agency that see

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,720
that you know there's a bit of a

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,160
start-up face you need to kind of get

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,960
some yeah methods in place but once the

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,720
whole team is convinced and everybody's

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,390
working with that I would not say it's

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,820
it's costing extra we're not adding 10%

00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:12,030
to to our projects just because they're

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,950
suddenly accessible so it's really maybe

00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,200
the first ones but I would say that's

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,420
good for anyone to you know go through

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,760
that face and learn a bit and and then

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,830
apply for everybody because there's more

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,450
people profiting from that than that

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,910
single client that will suffer from a

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:35,910
five or ten percent higher price Thanks

00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:38,650
great okay a quick question from then hi

00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:41,530
my name is Daniel from gene Ian

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,600
just a comment I think it's even though

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,750
I don't think that's why we should be

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,559
making sites accessible but I think it

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:54,250
can be useful that to make a client

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,170
realize that when you're making

00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,960
something more accessible it will also

00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:02,260
probably help people who are not

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,980
disabled are may be in a situation where

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:10,899
we're a better contrast will help and

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,610
and also make sure that they're not that

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:14,350
you have like a common understanding of

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,030
what you're talking about because I've

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,250
often noticed that we've been talking

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,870
about accessibility and then realize

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,240
that the person I'm talking to is only

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:25,780
thinking about maybe wheelchairs and

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,190
blood sometimes it's only blind people

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,480
of some for some people it's just

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,870
they're thinking about maybe

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,550
colorblindness and and then when you

00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,350
don't we're not talking about the same

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,200
thing it can be difficult to make an

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,929
argument good argument yeah yeah that's

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,639
why it's it's key to really explain and

00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:44,889
show the impact that you can make and

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,889
that is not just this 20% that is

00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:50,860
disabled but it's about so many more

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,919
people it's about you and I in bright

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:57,030
sunlight or in a train watching video

00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:01,060
without subtitles or something like that

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,170
great thank you taki welcome

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,579
[Applause]

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,579
