Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	This talk looks at the business side of web accessibility. Awareness around accessibility and inclusivity is increasing in the WordPress ecosystem but how can you as a designer, developer, or agency (owner) get the message across to your client? As makers of the web we often have to deal with myths like ‘accessible web design is ugly or boring’, ‘web accessibility is expensive and hard to implement’ and ‘my site audience does not include disabled people’. This talk looks at the WHY of Web Accessibility and provides the audience with HOW. HOW to convince your client that there are many benefits with having an accessible website.
