Title: Elisa Heikura: The next most important skill to learn
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	So you’re a splendid developer or designer, you bring your A game to work every day. You sleep like a log and jog like a fox and you’re practically unstoppable. Until feedback from your boss, colleague, or a customer comes into your inbox and all of a sudden, you’re this fiery ball of anger, resentment, and curse words. What just happened? How can you learn to receive feedback like a Buddhist unicorn, and how can you even benefit from it?

Wow so I'm the last one on you're all

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:11,370
thinking about lunch already you here

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,139
and you there I get home so I try to

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,529
keep this 12 minutes really really

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,080
efficient so like my name is ELISA and I

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,619
coach developers and I root for

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,689
communication skills empathy emotional

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,920
skill skills for listening so all sorts

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,960
of soft skills that in actually are the

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,780
ones that make you the professional and

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,559
the expert you actually want to be so

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,899
very very vital skills but in order for

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,790
you to listen intently for the next 12

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,440
minutes because I see so much like

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,850
tiredness in the room already we're

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,829
gonna do a little trick and you're gonna

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,800
hate me for this but I'm gonna challenge

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,649
you anyway I will want you to close

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,059
laptops with away your phones if you

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,879
have a back put your phone on the back

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,680
and if you have notebooks are everything

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,780
just clear the table in front of you so

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,609
you can lay your hands all right you can

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,619
do this already if your chest and our

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,020
face watching this then push your chair

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,250
back about five to 10 centimeters this

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,159
is gonna make some noise so do it

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,290
quickly now if you are a note-taker and

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,450
you're starting to hyperventilate don't

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,509
worry you can send me an e-mail to ELISA

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,850
the developer who comm and I will

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,229
provide you with notes and I'm extensive

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,000
note-taker so you will not be

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,150
disappointed with the notes that I would

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,369
bribe or provide you with and I will not

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,759
use your email for anything else so it's

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,070
completely safe now stand straight up

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,439
straighten your back now you don't have

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,930
to stand up like just sit down but sorry

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,880
straighten your back and then lean

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,920
forward and put your hands on the table

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,140
both hands on the table

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,290
it's really important that you sit

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,500
upright keep breathing to the pace that

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,009
you now have and lean forward

00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,020
that's an active listening position it's

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,229
telling your brain to listen more

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,140
carefully to pay attention to listen

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,239
what I'm saying to learn and you can use

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,190
this position for anything if you have

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,500
to listen to your spouse ranting about

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,540
something or your boss or a colleague

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,000
your customers when you want to learn

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,430
and listen more carefully just sit

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,460
upright and lean forward it tells your

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,210
brain to start concentrating and you

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,070
need that as well

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,040
when you're listening for feedback which

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,870
is our topic today I've been really

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,550
really really psyched about feedback for

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,080
the past six months I was reading about

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,290
it and studying about it and I was

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,790
absolutely sure that it is the next most

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,690
important skill to learn

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,200
hence the topic title however recently I

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,260
got my hand to this research recent

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,660
research that says that actually you

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,260
don't want feedback even if you're a

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,239
millennial

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,010
you just don't want it and that's not

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,100
much of a surprise none of us are a big

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,190
fans of feedback but it turns out that

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,380
we don't need it either it doesn't help

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,739
us grow it doesn't make us better

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,360
we won't benefit from feedback we do

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,430
need the positive feedback we do need

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,800
the attention to know that we go into

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,750
the right in the right direction but it

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,570
when comes to criticism and corrective

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,950
feedback it's not helpful and I was like

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,780
okay there goes my topic so I'm gonna

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,049
show you some kitten videos for the rest

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,810
eight minutes but then luckily I

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,450
realized that even if we don't want any

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,730
feedback even if we don't need any

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,010
feedback we're still gonna get some

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,900
feedback it's gonna keep coming at us

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,989
from our colleagues and bosses and

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,870
customers spouses friends mother-in-law

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,790
and we're still gonna get the flawed of

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,100
anger and resentment and curse words

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,420
even though we knew that we don't need

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,930
the feedback we're just going to get it

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,660
anyway

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,090
so I try to help you with that but the

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,370
rest of the time that I have but before

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,340
we do that we need to actually quickly

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,920
go through what feedback is so according

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,170
to Oxford English Dictionary feedback is

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,549
either information advice or criticism

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:18,419
about how good or useful something or

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:21,150
somebody's work is and that's not at all

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,120
helpful way to look at feedback because

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,669
it's sort of like a gift I'm in

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,420
possession of feedback and right with my

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,680
feedback

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,240
then I'm gonna give it to you like a

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,220
gift and you will have to take it as is

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,340
absorb it grow from it and learn from it

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,510
and that's not at all what happens you

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,250
all know the feeling when you get

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,360
feedback and you're seriously angry and

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,220
you don't want to listen to it at all

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,220
you want to throw the computer to the

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,020
wall so it's not like a gift yeah like a

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,080
feedback nice but that's not what

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,200
happens and the worst part is that when

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,450
it's criticism the feet a giver wants to

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,640
leave it you know on your inbox like

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,210
there's feedback yeah good luck with it

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,280
have fun

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm not gonna touch that subject anymore

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,480
we want you to learn from it and grow

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,180
from it just let me get out of this

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,710
really awkward situation what happens

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,680
when we get feedback is that we get

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,770
triggered and there is one of three

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,200
triggers that will activate the first

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,910
one is truth the second one is

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,070
relationships and the third one is

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,230
identity and you will recognize the

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,200
trigger by the inner monologue that's

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,390
going through your head so through rigor

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,910
sounds something like that's not true

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,660
that didn't happen that's not at all how

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,420
it went

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,100
that's unfair you don't know half of it

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,210
this is not helpful okay

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,420
relationship trigger however sounds

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,430
something like who are you to say after

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,620
everything I've done for you you should

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,150
look in the mirror after all the long

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,550
hours and the weekends that I've put

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,540
into this project after you that the

00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,540
