Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Going from co-founding a digital agency in a tiny suburban garage to running a company of 30 people has taught me things – many of which I’ve learned from my own failures. I’d like to present the 5 biggest mistakes of my entrepreneurial life so far to hopefully help others learn from those mistakes.

so what's in common with a small child

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,940
learning how to walk and an entrepreneur

00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,160
probably most of what they do keep they

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,470
both keep failing both keep falling down

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,240
getting back up again falling down

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,580
getting back up again falling down etc

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,230
the biggest difference I think is the

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,420
small child will eventually learn how to

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,030
walk the entrepreneur on the other hand

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,070
well will keep failing and that's why I

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,190
topic for today I'm gonna be talking

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,450
about my five favorite mistakes I've

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,320
made as an entrepreneur you can

00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,280
hopefully learn from and that I

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,870
personally have hopefully learned from

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,760
my name is Julie was alcohol I come from

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,059
ever made a digital agency based here in

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,800
Helsinki I'm one of the co-founders I

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,020
have a design background but I've

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,829
basically done everything you can in a

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,170
digital agency we basically started the

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,479
company straight out of school in 2011

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,850
and I know what you're all thinking

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,159
right now know that haircut is not my

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,430
first mistake it is a is it I'm not

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,939
proud of that but I have made a lot of

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,530
worse mistakes in my life but basically

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,310
I've done everything you can in a

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,770
company from layout design to concept

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,500
design to server design even front end

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,439
I've coated I think one WordPress site

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,770
from start to finish I've done sales

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,960
I've been the CEO for a couple years and

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,000
that's where lies my first issue my

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,909
first mistake and because I'm sort of a

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,439
master of none or a jack-of-all-trades I

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,149
kind of know a little bit about

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,590
everything which leads to a situation

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,750
where I try to do everything by myself

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,790
and a couple of years ago when I was

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,979
still - CEO I was basically handling

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,320
most of our sales probably 80% of our

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,390
sales while at the same time trying to

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
do some icon design for a site that was

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,729
doing some layout design I was running

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,420
from meeting to meeting I was handling

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,810
all the finances scrubbing the toilets

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,260
as old CEOs do so I felt like I was sort

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,909
of square

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,890
all trying to get to every single spot

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,900
and that was quite difficult and I was

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,930
fairly close to burnout at some point

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,730
and I realized that I do really need to

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,450
learn how to delegate and the thing with

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,909
delegation delegating is it's super easy

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,569
to delegate things you don't like or not

00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:36,000
care about but when you're an

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,730
entrepreneur you kind of do care about

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,489
everything so it is difficult to

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,349
delegate anything in the company and

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,329
I've tried to learn from that and I've

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,950
managed to find people to do what I've

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:53,069
used to do before and I try to give as

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,159
much to others as as possible there's a

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,950
quote by a person somebody told me once

00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:03,329
that 80% if there's someone who can do

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,489
80% of what you do just delegate I'm a

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,859
bit of a perfectionistic person myself

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:13,319
so I've kind of to struggle with the 80%

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:15,420
idea but I think that makes sense but if

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,060
you do delegate and when you do delegate

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,519
you have to take the good and the bad

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,329
that comes with it and here we get to my

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,299
next mistake not allowing others to fail

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,609
and this is a very very important one

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,540
and one that I struggle every single day

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,579
today I've personally learned from my

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,699
mistakes more than I have from anything

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,709
else I think school was good but being

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,480
an entrepreneur just a year or two

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,379
probably taught me a lot more than five

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,510
years in in a university and if I don't

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,760
allow others to fail then how are they

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,500
supposed to learn if I try to help them

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,639
it comes from a good place I want to

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,349
make sure that everything is running

00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,019
smoothly and and and everybody knows

00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,549
what they're supposed to do and so on

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,949
but if I go and intervene and try to

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,449
help people they start to think that

00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,609
they are not good enough or they won't

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,230
III think that they won't be able to

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,720
come up with the solution themselves and

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:15,629
where I learned this from was I am a

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:18,000
lucky father of two girls and when they

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,250
learned how to walk and they learn how

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,979
to eat and they learn how to put their

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,400
clothes on I realized that at daycare or

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,180
with my wife they always did it really

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,610
well

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,680
with me they would say no dad I can't do

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,150
it I'm not good you know I'm I don't

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,340
know how to put my clothes on I don't

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,460
know how to walk I don't know how to do

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,990
this and I realized that is because I'm

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,449
trying to help them all the time it

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,940
comes from a place of love but I'm sort

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,160
of trying too much to help them so you

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,680
sort of have to you know look the other

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,880
way when they're about to hit a rock or

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,370
you or they're about to like collapse on

00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,389
the floor they just need to let them go

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:03,900
but then on the other hand you also need

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,220
to know when to intervene when to you

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,860
know when they're close to the cliff

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,840
edge maybe you sort of sort of have to

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,479
take something do something intervene

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,900
there they're about to fall down a set

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,490
of stairs you need to take action and

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:23,400
here we get to my third failure which is

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:26,039
probably one of the worst ones and that

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,150
is chickening out and avoiding and

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,099
delaying conflict or negative issues and

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,530
this is a difficult one as well so

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,870
you're trying to allow others to fail

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,760
and do their own thing but then again

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,260
you need to make sure that that project

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,580
is on time you need to make sure that

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,400
the client is happy you need to make

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,900
sure that if there's a feedback that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
needs to be given or critiques or

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,310
someone you need to take it and go for

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,039
it

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,570
without delays and and and and so on and

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,310
the difficult part is to know and

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,310
understand and look into yourself and

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,520
see when I'm when am I trying to let

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,099
these people do their own thing and when

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,020
I'm just covering and avoiding and

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:11,729
delaying the inevitable conflict and

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,300
there's good few missed mistakes that

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,340
I've made in this sort of team the most

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,970
difficult thing an entrepreneur or a

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,690
manager can do is let someone go and it

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,820
is never an easy decision but when it

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:32,009
comes to avoiding a difficult situation

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,949
letting someone go is as difficult as it

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:37,500
gets and personally sometimes I've let

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,710
people stay at the company for a year

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,240
too long and at that point

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,810
there's been things happening with

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,979
clients who's been hard by that other

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:53,370
employees team members aren't by that

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,810
having to cover up or or so on and this

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,560
is definitely one of the things that

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:02,090
I've tried to learn is to not avoid not

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,410
delay and act when it's necessary I

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,320
don't want to be Donald Trump or

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:11,190
anything but sometimes you need to cut

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,220
your losses but delaying and avoiding

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,400
conflict is also something that has led

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,490
to my fourth mistake which is a pretty

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,320
favorite of mine and that's something

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,870
that probably anybody with a corporate

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,330
business card can relate to and that has

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,090
to do with the annoying paperwork and

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,930
not doing my paperwork on time so this

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,610
dates back a few years back when I would

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,789
just started out as the CEO of the

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,110
company back then we didn't have these

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,669
nice apps that you can just take a

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,080
picture of the receipt then everything

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,900
is going fine and that goes to the

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,210
account we actually actually had to send

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,789
like paper receipts every single month

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,830
to the accountant and I mean there's

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,870
always stuff to do so clients that you

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,360
need to work with and so on and you

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,409
might sometimes just try to push that

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,930
back and I started out as a CEO and

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:05,940
everything was running fine we had money

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,729
in the bank not that we would swim in it

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,840
but we had a good like three-month

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:17,039
buffer as as you'd hope and a couple of

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,500
weeks later I get a mail a letter in the

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,000
mail from the tax office my favorite

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,520
people and that little letter says hey

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,590
Julius you're not gonna be able to

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,830
invoice anybody at again again because

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,690
you're owing us some v.a.t.s okay let's

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,729
handle the three seats and stuff and

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:44,310
we'll be fine from the past six months

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:48,990
and the nice bank account balance sort

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:50,670
of went from that to a situation where

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,380
we started think about if we need to do

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,340
some sort of other type of paperwork

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,300
soon

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,970
and that took a ton out of myself and my

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,770
my own well-being but I struggled

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,920
through that with my with the help of my

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,779
partners and and and my colleagues we

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,710
managed to save the situation everything

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:14,730
went fine nobody you know was harmed by

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,230
that no paychecks were late and we we

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,839
sort of survived that and a few years

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,450
later we're all well off now we have all

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,880
these nice apps that we can scan the

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,690
receipts right away and not get to this

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,390
situation but delaying the inevitable is

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:34,890
something that you have to learn not to

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,440
do and from this situation where we had

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,240
to struggle with the receipts and had to

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,440
struggle with this issue situation and

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,870
issue that's that's where sort of the

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,480
whole issue with being an entrepreneur

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,100
arises from this is whatever happens

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,450
whether it's you whether it's clients

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,150
whether it's projects whether it's team

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,800
members it's all on you at the end of

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,930
the day it's you having the sleep of

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,610
some sleepless nights wondering what you

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,990
could do and what have you done wrong

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,760
and that can take a lot of sort of

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,220
energy out of you it can take its toll

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,050
and I think many who have been

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,800
entrepreneurs or are entrepreneurs can

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:17,880
relate to this sort of constant anxiety

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,370
of the future and and that's where we

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,540
get to my my last fail and definitely my

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,810
biggest one and that is not prioritizing

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,890
my family or my personal well-being over

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,870
everything else

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,630
because at the end of the day this is

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,110
the most important thing that you can do

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,720
if you're not well the company will

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,000
probably not be well the clients will

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,070
probably not be well your family your

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,750
loved ones probably won't be well so you

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,610
need to focus your own personal

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,480
well-being above every single other

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:54,870
thing as I said I have two daughters now

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,660
and and and I think nobody in their

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,160
deathbed ever said you know if only I

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,410
had fixed that bug or if only I had

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,209
figured out the issue with that cash

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,190
and this is something that we should all

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,930
understand and think about is how much

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,850
effort do we really want to put into

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,230
this at the end of the day what's

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,240
important to you and we need to also

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,459
understand that failure is fine it's

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,410
okay to make these mistakes it's okay if

00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:28,769
as long as we learn and as long as we

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,750
sort of figure out how to do better but

00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:32,459
we as adults are sometimes not that good

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,930
at that we are afraid of failure and

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,990
we're afraid of making those mistakes

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,509
and I think we should all take a little

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,279
take a bit of a page out of the book of

00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,470
these toddlers and these babies and

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,990
these little kids learning to take their

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:49,439
first steps and to eat their own food

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,529
and just try new things and be open to

00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:54,779
failure because if you know we often put

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,699
ourselves in these boxes where I can't

00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,819
do this or I'm not good enough for or

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:03,089
I'm just not that type of a person but

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:06,569
have you ever seen a child that sort of

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:10,139
goes you know I think I'm just not the

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:13,889
walking type all of us walk here so I

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,620
think nobody will crawl on the floor so

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:20,120
let's be more like little babies less

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,610
like boring adults afraid of failure and

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,580
that's my talk for today thank you

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,580
