good morning everyone I'm glad to be

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:10,340
here it's my second trip to Finland

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,750
actually the last time I was here I was

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,760
14 years old and spending a full summer

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,220
driving throughout Norway where I am

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,000
from from the South in Friedreich's top

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,630
and all the way up north with my family

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,260
so when we were up there my father was

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,170
like hey let's visit Finland for the

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,230
first time so we did we cross the border

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,719
at some random place with our goal to

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,579
reach a great lunch you know have a

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,379
great time in a small nice place in

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,570
Finland we never found that place so

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,969
basically and after drawing for a while

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,030
you know up there the distances are long

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,520
and we we gave up drumming back to

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,530
Norway without talking to a single

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,230
person

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,989
this trip however is quite the opposite

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,530
so this is a very nice experience very

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,740
glad to be in Helsinki great city so

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,640
let's get started my name is 2r Andreea

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:22,979
and with me I have our senior developer

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:25,799
Marko we work in front come it's a

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:32,240
digital agency located in Norway

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:35,700
Portugal and Poland we are an innovation

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,909
oriented the company I might say so when

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,970
our work with the Guttenberg Jas and

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,970
Guttenberg cloud and also several other

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:53,060
projects is supported by the Norwegian

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:56,820
Research Council now Gutenberg cloud all

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,340
web project owners want to provide the

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,070
best editing experience possible for

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,060
their users whether your site is a

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,390
university site a non-profit site or a

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,270
high-traffic news outlet you want to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,640
empower your editors with the absolutely

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:18,380
best to

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:21,400
to grow their digital presence now we

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,930
originally come from the Drupal world

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:30,880
now Drupal is almost like a CMS

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:35,090
framework but the Drupal admin interface

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,319
can feel overwhelming it's not always

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:43,930
intuitive and these days you expect a

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:48,049
CMS to be both flexible and easy to use

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,650
so this is why we introduced Gutenberg

00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:54,200
content editor for Drupal and we

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,269
presented this in Drupal Europe which is

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,450
a conference that was in Germany this

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:05,510
fall we started with the Guttenberg

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:09,470
editor we stripped away the PHP from

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:13,970
that and created our pure react library

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:17,570
called Gutenberg j/s on top of that we

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,310
built a drupal module and last week we

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,250
had a release candidate for that on

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:28,959
drupal.org and it already has more than

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:33,140
nine thousand downloads our original

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,470
motivation was to just improve the

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,299
Drupal authoring experience but as we

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:43,819
got started a greater vision emerged

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:46,730
making Guttenberg the go-to solution for

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:53,389
editing rich content on the web

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:56,120
period Guttenberg is more than just

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:59,030
another editor we believe that it's a

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,889
platform enabling amazing new features

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:06,859
built by the community by all of you and

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:09,579
this is why we have really focused on

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:13,750
making it easy to add new blogs and

00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:17,780
share your code what has happened in the

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,820
WordPress space is that companies are

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,520
releasing nice collections of blocks

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,960
well this introduces a bit of bloat

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,949
however

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,449
so let's think a bit bigger we want a

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:40,810
sustainable ecosystem of blocks but also

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:44,600
the ease of use this is why we created

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:52,100
Gutenberg cloud your library of blocks

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:56,630
in a cloud a good MIRR cloud is browsing

00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:02,500
experience for downloading and enabling

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:05,750
Gutenberg blocks any developer can

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,110
actually add their own blocks by putting

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,789
cold on NPM and ping us for a code

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,020
review the code itself is served via a

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:19,090
CDN

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,979
it's all just a J's and CSS anyways and

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,370
since the blocks are JavaScript only

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:28,550
they work across Drupal and WordPress

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,460
alike now this is really interesting

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,530
you can now build a front-end for

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,530
WordPress and Drupal at the same time

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:43,010
it's all about open source anyone can

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:49,220
publish their blocks we do code reviews

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:50,990
but it's only for security purposes so

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,380
this is the this is the plug-in you need

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:58,159
and while this plug-in is stable already

00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,710
and we're just getting started and we're

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:04,159
happy to see that there's already been

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,800
some interest from key players like Matt

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:12,710
and Greece which is the founder of the

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:16,270
Drupal CMS and this work is also covered

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:22,449
by a VP tavern several times by

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:29,720
targeting and in this article here so

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:33,789
let's get ready for the demo so what we

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:38,060
Marco here will start show is a demo of

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:40,850
well it's the demo page on Gutenberg

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:52,910
cloud dot org feel free to have a visit

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:55,460
if you'd like but let's go okay okay so

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,820
as shown previously you can browse

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,750
through all the blocks published on the

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:06,050
clouds but you can also try them out

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,560
without installing on your sites using

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:13,940
this demo sites the demo dot Gutenberg

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:17,290
clouds are or so let's try here as you

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:21,110
can see just a simple Gutenberg editor

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:25,880
writes straight down and let's try some

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:29,180
to have some blocks available on the

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,320
cloud for example you have this content

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:37,070
in columns okay

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:49,400
so works pretty good you can change the

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:53,500
settings as you would can upload it just

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,500
to check how it looks looks good

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:09,410
oh it's a plane it's a boy I guess

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:13,460
you've missed it and you can try it here

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:16,220
- can you help me out

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:23,030
yeah well it's over here oh yeah this

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:27,730
one can totally know this is something

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:31,450
Nordic yeah yeah no no no ignore it

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:36,260
yeah there we go it's a mountain yes

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,930
okay so it works pretty good and you

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,950
don't have to install any of the cloud

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,920
blocks - on your WordPress site but you

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:51,650
could of course so let's have a look at

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:56,300
how that works so I have a local

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:59,420
WordPress installation here so what I do

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:06,100
then is to go to the plugin page I click

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:16,330
add new and then I will search for cloud

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:23,090
whoa cloud blocks and here we have it I

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:23,780
can simply install it here and after

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:29,660
that is done

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,470
I activate it like this and I'm all

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,170
ready to go

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,570
what happens now is that you consider

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,920
that like I get our cloud blocks link in

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:43,070
my main menu so I go here and I'm

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,390
straight into the same list of cloud

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:52,460
blocks and I can select a few to install

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:55,130
or activate actually so lets that

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:59,840
continent in : block also that marco

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:06,820
showed and we should be good to go I'll

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:09,379
go to pages now and add a new one and

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:16,699
well the obvious

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:20,569
title WordCamp or dick and let's start

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:28,759
with that hero section that just

00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:32,359
installed well for drupal no for any CMS

00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:35,089
of course I can change some settings

00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:38,749
there like set that image on the left

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,369
side I can say that I want an image in

00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:44,929
the background instead of a solid color

00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:48,619
and then I can choose to set the amount

00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:51,909
of overlay for that block to make my

00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:57,229
contrast for the text good enough

00:10:51,909 --> 00:11:00,739
readable yet a vegetable background very

00:10:57,229 --> 00:11:05,089
good let's go down here and add that

00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:08,659
content in columns book and then I get

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:24,829
the same list view here like Marco just

00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:27,379
shown you but if you prefer you you you

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:30,199
you can do if you prefer to have your

00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:35,839
blocks codes on your WordPress site

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:39,639
locally you can install them locally and

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:44,119
my local is I mean and WordPress folder

00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:48,609
all you have to do is just zip the lock

00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,609
folder and the plaudits let me show you

00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:56,579
let's go to crop masked area what we

00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,269
decide

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,920
yeah something region frilly remark oh

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,869
yeah Marco is from Portugal by the way

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,230
so but you're in the regions get mirrors

00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:12,569
oh yeah it's getting yeah yep so you can

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:14,970
find the tap the local tap here and as

00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:27,480
you can see it's empty so let's just

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:31,459
upload a new blog and install it so now

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,679
that you've uploaded you can just simply

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:38,249
activate it and it will be available on

00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,809
the editor nice and that's the first

00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:42,299
version of that block Marco isn't it

00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:50,040
yeah yeah it's a cool book it's a

00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:54,660
problem that one also okay so we've seen

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,089
how to install this in in WordPress we

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,459
have activated the actual cloud blocks

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,579
which is served from the cloud and we

00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:05,549
have installed a local block now let's

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:09,929
have a look at the use case we are

00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:14,369
currently working on the new website for

00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:16,949
UNICEF in Norway they have a Drupal site

00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:19,470
so just for the fun of it let's demo

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:24,529
that in Drupal and see how that looks

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:30,059
there there we've also made like a

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:34,160
variation of the key role block let me

00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,160
just set our image for that

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:46,589
some of the similar elements it also has

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,600
some interesting styling features for

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:53,070
the text we can highlight some of the

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:58,620
text which can be toggled on and off up

00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:03,959
here I can change the actual text here

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:09,240
of course and to make the design

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:15,149
consistent we removed the styling

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:18,000
options or that part but of course they

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:24,240
can also go in and change the button

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,540
text and add a link of course and in the

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,139
sidebar we have a few options like for

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:36,149
example very relevant for them is to add

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:38,970
a donation form the block to choose if

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:43,470
you want like a full height for that or

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:47,430
a bit smaller one they can choose to

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:49,860
remove the title the teaser text and

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:56,000
even the call-to-action button there in

00:14:49,860 --> 00:15:04,339
the bottom let's have a look at another

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,670
we can check the mosaic block which is

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:10,110
two cones and a lot of demo content to

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,649
make it easier for them to get started

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,220
building out the content so they can go

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:20,760
in here and replace the photos to

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,889
something that they'd like a lot of

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,790
unsplash photos here interesting over

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:30,360
there and of course they could set their

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:33,740
own text here which of course is word

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,740
camp Nordic

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:51,430
here as they choose and of course

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:57,910
obviously the link one loss block that

00:15:51,430 --> 00:16:02,770
I'll show you is a book called fact for

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:08,710
displaying facts it has a basic look

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:15,910
like this and some icons utter preset

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:22,050
here we have a large type own field here

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:27,970
and we're also able to add a small title

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:31,930
above that some like medicine and then

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:39,400
the actual facts did you know for

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:45,340
example that 80% of all medicine is yeah

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:47,590
I don't know you didn't know that yeah

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,030
it's fun facts you can bring that off in

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:59,620
several locations actually and then you

00:16:52,030 --> 00:17:07,890
can add text to that support us if you'd

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:14,740
like so that should be it mm-hmm let's

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:18,310
move to under the road yeah let's check

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:23,010
out all things that's it done yep it's a

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:27,310
cat under hood that's always obviously

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:31,330
ok we already mentioned that o'clock

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:35,500
blocks are published to NPM is anyone

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:40,120
familiar with NPM yeah ok great to see

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,730
that yeah so NPM is basically a software

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,390
package manager originally made for

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,090
managing no GS packages and its

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:56,409
dependencies but nowadays he can

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:59,110
you use for any language okay so the

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:03,490
easiest way to create a new cloth block

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:07,330
and eventually publish it is to use the

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,999
create cloud block command I'm sorry

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,679
command line tool that we developed and

00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:17,320
of course it's open source

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,539
you need to have no GS and NPM installed

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,389
on your system and to install it you

00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:26,409
just need to secure that come at NPM

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:28,769
install with the global flat and create

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:35,289
cloud block

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:38,830
okay so after the tool install you can

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:42,249
execute this command and px create cloud

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:46,240
block and then the name of the block you

00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:51,879
want to give in this case we name it WC

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:54,100
n walk so this will create a basic block

00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:57,639
with all the structure the cost

00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,029
structure necessary for a cloud block

00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:05,169
you know basically it's a block starter

00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:07,919
to make your life easier it may take a

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:12,070
while to execute this command because

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:16,059
the tool also installs an instance of G

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:20,649
editor which is a react app you already

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:23,259
seen it is basically the demo sites and

00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:27,700
that allows you to quickly test the

00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:30,759
block well while you're developing okay

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,039
so you know instead of building the

00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:37,059
block zip it and move it to the

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:42,580
WordPress install folder and test it on

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:46,539
wordpress this is quite easier and

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:49,840
basically basically that's it so to come

00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:53,860
here we just run the command NPM starts

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,379
and it will automatically open a browser

00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:01,880
window and run the G editor extensions

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:09,830
instance and then you can just

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:12,530
add your block to test it yeah and and

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:17,720
when your block is ready you can just

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:19,970
build it with the command NPM built you

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:25,039
can say that it basically what it does

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:28,460
is creates the package on a on the build

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,630
folder with with minimize minified code

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:37,400
and then you can just move it and upload

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:41,299
it using the cloud block plugin or you

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,150
can just publish to NPM by running NPM

00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,490
publish yeah that's what we really want

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,970
though so we can share our code yeah

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:55,159
it's what is it easy okay so just a note

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:58,490
I'm not seeing that some developers are

00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:03,020
a bit apprehensive about learning

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:06,740
JavaScript and especially react but

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,679
taken from from my own experience I had

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:14,960
very little experience with react before

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:18,890
this you know Gutenberg revolution but

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,980
still using this tool to create cloud

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,789
block and of course following the

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,840
wordpress.org block reference

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:35,090
documentation I was able to build some

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:39,289
some quite complex blocks so guess what

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:51,110
I actually learned react by building

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:56,360
blocks very good with Gutenberg jeaious

00:21:51,110 --> 00:22:00,880
and the Gutenberg cloud we envision a

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,980
growing library of CMS agnostic blocks

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,090
design components and even proper web

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,809
components you code it once and reuse

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,190
your designs in any CMS

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:16,259
we believe Gutenberg's e

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,179
of use will bring new business

00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,139
opportunities to other open source

00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:27,659
projects and ultimately improving the

00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:31,169
open web to learn more about this go to

00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:35,100
good Murray cloud org and also check out

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:39,120
Drupal get married at org for updates

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:43,139
you can follow at get more cloud on

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,139
Twitter and our latest slide has all the

00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:51,379
resources and links that you should need

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:55,139
to get going yeah and as an EndNote

00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:58,590
thanks for all the Guttenberg

00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:59,940
contributors and testers out there we

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,750
believe that you've built something

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,509
truly powerful yeah

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,299
you're basically our testament to the

00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,930
power of open source so thank you for

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,090
that

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,720
[Applause]

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:18,329
[Music]

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:23,949
[Applause]

00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:27,279
thank you for that now we have time for

00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:30,429
questions like in the first round so we

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:34,029
have couple of options in here we can

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:36,669
use that mic if you want to walk a

00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:41,169
little bit or we can use the throw my

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:42,489
console sure so is there any questions

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:51,969
from the audience

00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:54,789
Oh like okay first one it's on oh hi I'm

00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:57,549
Nicolas so is this a free service or a

00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:59,289
paid service and do you have any if it's

00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:02,829
free do you have any monetization plans

00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:08,069
what are you thinking it's totally free

00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:08,069
and that's the whole idea behind it

00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:12,879
we're allowed to stay here and talk

00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:15,459
about this good things and hopefully

00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:18,879
that's gonna give us some good

00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:25,809
opportunities as well so that should

00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:27,999
date and of course we think that that

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:29,919
kind of model is something that we need

00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,799
you know that kind of open source spirit

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,499
that can help us to actually involve

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:44,609
people like you to the project so we

00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:48,009
need that yep go ahead hi I'm Christine

00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:50,979
really interesting project I was looking

00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:53,440
at state of the word the other day where

00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:57,669
Matt says something about maybe in the

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,889
future blocks or the finding of box

00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:03,699
should be implemented in WordPress core

00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:06,039
as in you right and then you kind of

00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:10,179
search and then you maybe just install

00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:12,909
the block have you been in contact with

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:16,209
him about this or doing vision this

00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:21,519
influence or even be the solution for

00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:26,220
the core block integration fine things

00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:28,320
version I know that our CTO

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,389
has been in contact directly with mats

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,309
related to these kind of things but I'm

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:39,029
not familiar with the details sorry so

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:41,220
no extra snack for that what's the state

00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,110
of localization and translation of the

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:49,200
blocks so is it possible to download

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:51,899
language files or something well yeah

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,509
currently it's not but that's something

00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:56,509
we've been working on but you can use

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:04,830
the default for example if you use the

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:07,409
in Drupal we have this translation

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:10,259
function in WordPress we have also the

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:18,299
double underscore right so you can use

00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:21,059
that and but on the on the back end you

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:24,690
know on the admin UI for the front-end

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:27,389
well basically it's the stuff yeah

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:32,610
it's content yeah it's content so yeah

00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:35,639
it's possible to in terms like hi have

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,840
really cool project I think I see

00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:38,610
showing a couple of blocks here and

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,100
you've shown mostly like front-end

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,690
blocks and I'm wondering if you want to

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,019
have a block for example that would list

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,669
the latest posts from a category of

00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,039
posts or like blocks that would require

00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:53,039
some sort of database connectivity for

00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,899
each CMS how is that handled and if it's

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,720
not how do you plan to handle it in the

00:26:54,899 --> 00:27:00,720
future

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,590
well obviously blocks that integrates

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,480
specifically with the CMS itself and

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,980
need to be specific for the CMS so we've

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,220
been discussing you know a way to

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,559
categorize I and categorize that when

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,120
you're on the in the in the browser so

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,730
you can sort of exclude the ones that

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,610
into it with different CMS's and see

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:24,539
that all this is a WordPress integrated

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,509
block for example but then you will

00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:35,260
commit the code to NPM the PHP parts of

00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:40,900
the code or yeah sure yep and the other

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:46,720
since any other questions from the

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:52,780
audience I have couple we have time I've

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:56,590
like 21 questions great you mentioned

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,300
like the Gutenberg say yes I didn't

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,420
really get it do you mean that you have

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,160
kind of ripped off the Gutenberg from

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,930
the current blocking version or

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,210
something yeah kind of made date and

00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,010
maintain that kind of separately from

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,650
the core and from the coup de Burgh

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:14,940
blocking itself or but the good works a

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:19,530
is mean in this context or basically a

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:22,720
gutenberg forward press obviously has

00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:28,150
quite a lot of PHP that connects to

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,670
WordPress and yeah that's we basically

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,520
removed all that PHP and replace that

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:38,980
with reactive components instead right

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,570
yeah so to make it like CMS agnostic so

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,400
you know the Drupal example we just did

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,070
there is just well that's exact thing

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,030
that we've built so far but there's

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:51,540
nothing wrong with using Gutenberg j/s

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:56,620
as a component to run the editor

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:58,840
anywhere is that horrible to maintain

00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,150
because there might be lots of changes

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,280
in the good record point which are not

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,890
related to your script so you need to

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,560
like rip out stuff like every day or

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,170
every week or how the process goes in

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,560
practice

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:17,230
yeah sure actually there's a little

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,500
overrides to the code so we met so

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:23,920
because you know the Gutenberg react

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,580
part is so well made so some modular

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,820
it's possible to do that so we just for

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,490
parts like the probably if I remember

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:37,060
correctly the core image block perhaps

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,930
and well the rest like uploading files

00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,740
and things like that

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:44,530
they are quite modular you can implement

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,110
a separate components without overriding

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,620
anything on the Gutenberg so yeah it's

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,660
very little overrides we have

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,390
that sounds good

00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:03,910
I did hurt a couple of other questions

00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:07,210
night and 19 actually a 19 left just

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,610
can't remember anymore but is there any

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:17,590
other questions from the audience while

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:19,180
I'm thinking couple of the hard ones you

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,230
already mentioned while you were

00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,540
speaking the kind of couple of options

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,700
you might have so did I understand

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:31,740
correctly that one option is actually

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:36,220
that somehow you get the chase for the

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,740
block itself from the kind of from the

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:43,750
npm library and it lives somewhere and

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:48,190
it sucks hooks in the admin interface in

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:51,910
any CMS where does that say this

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:55,870
actually lives basically it's served

00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:58,690
through CloudFlare just like Google

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:02,500
Fonts for example and if you use that so

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:05,710
you know for 98% of the site's out there

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,559
your blocks will be served faster using

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:14,950
the service than your own server no

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:17,770
offense and the other option was that

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,100
you can actually upload the chief file

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,679
of the kind of the block code itself and

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,679
it's installs in WordPress case for

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,870
example in some folder yes on the

00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,330
there's a folder and on the uploads

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:35,920
there's the full fought box it will

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:42,370
live there okay that's one more question

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:44,770
of the same thing so I think the hard

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:49,840
part is getting people involved because

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:52,630
as I understand is that people like you

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,140
in the audience people like me perhaps

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:58,300
in the future people like Marco who are

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,880
interested in kind of learning a little

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,080
bit react on JavaScript could actually

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,680
create a blog

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:10,770
which done you can use in any software

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,440
any CMS what are the kind of the

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:16,710
struggles that people actually start

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,730
doing that or is they already like of

00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:27,600
lots of lots of kind of donations by the

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:30,600
God already how it's been the start are

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,550
those example blocks something that you

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,610
have actually created or are they made

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,560
by somebody else and how many kind of

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,830
coders there are already who have

00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:44,450
uploaded they won't block in there well

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,370
we made a few of them and some are like

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:51,060
contributions from people that we hardly

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:53,910
know out there and but of course you

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,570
know this is this is quite fresh still

00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:01,410
and we just we just released it

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:03,360
basically so I think and we really

00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,300
enjoyed this opportunity as a first step

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,020
to reach out to all of you guys because

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,760
it's well it's difficult to contribute

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,520
to something you don't have ever heard

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,370
about obviously so yeah but as Marco

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,930
mentioned it's probably no getting in to

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,150
react and everything like that that

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,460
could be feel like a large stuff to

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:30,480
someone but what's really good done with

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,340
using them create cloud book back it's

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,370
just a starting point it really helps

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,600
you to get that structure in place so if

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,150
you're familiar with JavaScript you can

00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,700
dig into that and you sort of understand

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:45,630
how to work with react and you're by

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,120
doing that you actually learn react so

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:51,030
it's a very good very good starting

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,150
point it's a win-win for ya definitely

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,900
recommend checking it out that all

00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,330
sounds good

00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,140
perhaps in next contributor day we can

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:04,830
you know range from yes that'd be great

00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,900
yeah any other questions from the

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:11,000
audience we still have a couple of

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:14,960
minutes so at least one question can you

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:22,879
walk or can you draw the mic from there

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:27,770
there is one from here can you hello GU

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,899
Birds obviously changing a lot 5.2 came

00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,579
out recently so how are you navigating

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:34,849
the changes in Guttenberg and have you

00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:38,000
seen the proposed changes about defining

00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:40,369
blocks as Jason so they can be available

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,260
in the API so they can be using stuff

00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:48,260
like a mobile app good question well we

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,889
do need to chase the main repository for

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:55,879
that and so and we usually need some

00:34:51,889 --> 00:35:04,059
time to update and good merge a s

00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:06,529
library yeah but yeah and that was also

00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,720
why we didn't get like a stable release

00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:13,670
of that earlier because we had to wait

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,710
for the actual 5.0 WordPress phrase are

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,569
you involved in the github project are

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:24,289
you trying to contribute to that and

00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:30,140
feedback yeah we have a developer yeah

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:34,490
yeah several actually yeah but but as I

00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:39,049
said for Gutenberg Jia's for example now

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:42,740
if we know that the good work + work + 5

00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:45,440
is more stable it's quite easy to you

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,279
know move the the changes to go to Burgi

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:56,539
s because since we use P a few overrides

00:35:49,279 --> 00:36:00,710
it's quite easy to to update that so in

00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:02,839
terms of so far what kind of time

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:07,369
aspects how much time are we using

00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,069
usually do we need when we get only for

00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:13,369
the last version I think it was one day

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:17,049
or two probably yeah so usually quite

00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,049
quick attack the thing that célèbre

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,990
Thanks

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:26,690
we have one last questions from there hi

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,460
um I was just curious how well does the

00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,270
Guttenberg blocks integrate with the

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,270
rest api

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,030
well the gutenberg cloud doesn't

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,630
integrate with the api will to make it

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:44,120
available across many systems like

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,540
Drupal and WordPress eventually more to

00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,920
come

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:50,720
using youtubers we need to make it for

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,920
now we need to make it as simple as

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:59,210
possible so on the admin UI you will

00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,370
have basic JavaScript and CSS and for

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,970
the front-end of course it's only it's

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:07,610
only outputting HTML so for now we're

00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:11,000
doing this but in the future who knows

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:16,700
and if we have more contributors we can

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,270
find some solution to kind of fetch data

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:25,220
from several api's from several systems

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:27,530
yes yeah ok ok thank you

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,800
I think that was our last questions

00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,170
because of the time limit but once again

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,630
here to thank you about the presentation

00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,570
with the applause thank you guys thank

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,099
you

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,099
