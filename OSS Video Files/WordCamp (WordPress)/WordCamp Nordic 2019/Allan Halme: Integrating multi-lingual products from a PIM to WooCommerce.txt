	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,069
so I've been working on this project for

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,660
a while it's not live yet and and when I

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,000
heard about word camp Nordic I was like

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,070
this is I thought this is interesting

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,019
this is an unusually interesting project

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,330
for me and it occurred to me immediately

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,380
that it'd be cooler coming talk about

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,240
this so thanks for having me here and

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,220
I've been in software for a long time

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,730
but I want to get into the context of

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,250
this particular exercise which is for a

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,960
Finnish company called Himalayan bins

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,710
we'll know this company many Nordics

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,989
will probably be aware of this coming up

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,570
to 200 years old

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:41,070
James Finlayson was a Quaker from

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,870
Scotland who came to Finland him

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,420
basically effectively brought the

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,340
Industrial Revolution to Finland if you

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,399
can go to town better you can see the

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,770
old factories and buildings that he

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,539
built at the time they're like movie

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,780
theaters and museums and things like

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,410
that

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,140
and Finlayson makes textile products

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,750
their new stuff that is coming out now

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,430
they have a lot of mummy Moomin

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,000
character based things in the device

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,560
install Finland the purpose of

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,180
mentioning this of course is for general

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,030
context but also that they sell

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,580
internationally

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,500
Japanese love Moomin products and so in

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,280
Finland licenses the woman characters

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:29,159
then they sell pretty well in Japan and

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,619
elsewhere they have some many thousands

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,210
of products in total historically

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,939
they're not necessarily on sale anymore

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,079
as well as the current selection of

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,470
products that can find from the online

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:47,009
store or in in their physical stores and

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,189
and they use this system called perfume

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,189
it's a Danish company there are others

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,899
this is a good one I'm not specifically

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,710
experienced in this product information

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,820
management systems for those that don't

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,689
know what this is or what it what it

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,740
means if you imagine that you have

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,780
products that you sell physical products

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,190
like a bathrobe three different colors

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,460
three different sizes and you have

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,800
towels in many call

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,110
and bed sheets and things we would

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,570
manage all of that information and I

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,700
have seen this done using for example

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,210
Google sheets turns out Google sheets

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:26,650
has a two million cell upper limit you

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:29,530
hit that and it's annoying so you know

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,660
after a certain point you need a system

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,190
to manage the data properly including

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,260
things like internationalization and

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,660
translations when you have a product

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,240
named in three languages you may have

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,370
product images that are language

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,600
specific if you have a picture of a

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,180
bathrobe wall you know it's probably the

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,280
same this more applies to things like

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,800
marketing images where it'll contain

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,480
some text but it can apply to product

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,510
information you can have a picture of a

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,910
product that is tied to a language just

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,590
like the textual description or name of

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,990
the product might be tied to a

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,220
particular language and so perfume is

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,860
the product information management

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,600
system that is being used and where all

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,150
information is pulled out from and where

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,770
it is managed internally the courts

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,760
that's just straight from their website

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:18,270
I it wasn't appropriate to pull up an

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,400
actual screenshot from their life system

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,180
other parts of the context where where

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,230
we work

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,210
there are currently the consumer stores

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,670
Finlayson dot f5 emulation of SE and

00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,060
international store at Finlayson

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,090
shop.com run our Shopify and their ERP

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,870
which manages all inventories prices

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,510
orders custom information is Microsoft

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,040
Dynamics NAV this just for background

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,140
it's a whole separate interesting story

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,870
to discuss integration to these systems

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,900
as well but in this context what's

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,270
missing from Finland and and what we

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,250
started to to think about are so the

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,600
problem that we had to solve was we need

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,500
an online store for corporate customers

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,480
the the absolute volumes of this are

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,740
quite significant in addition to the

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,480
consumers sales in online stores and in

00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,130
brick-and-mortar stores it

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,859
there are visitors here and go to that

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,109
aha sinky there's a cool flagship store

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,520
on Esplanade II and these customers

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:26,300
again you know it's back to the language

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,650
thing of course Finland is important you

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,360
can go to Esplanade II and there's the

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,680
Moomin shop you go in there that the

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,780
Finlayson movement themed products

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,250
Sweden course part of the you but then

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,280
Sweden has a bit of a special place here

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,210
the rest of the EU Sweden for example

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,940
does not work in euro currency we also

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,310
use a public pl multi currency it's not

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,010
a topic for today but was part of this

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,139
problem overall and the customization

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,930
requirements have been different in this

00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:01,310
case of corporate customers than for b2c

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,840
stores they come from different places

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,660
there are different customer groups the

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,180
the selection of products out of the

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,270
entire product set that foundation has

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,060
and produces in sales at any moment does

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,250
vary based on country based on like

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,750
weird things I don't even know about

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,600
brand license restrictions for example

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,930
Finlayson uses Tom of Finland Moomin

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,910
there's been some WWF work done

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,310
previously etc and there all kinds of

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,130
exchange rules that apply to these and

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,050
these have to be considered and of

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,900
course specifically the language issue

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,060
is important that for Finns for the

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,400
Finnish corporate customers it's it's

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,410
extremely important that they can do

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,210
their business in Finnish it's it's not

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,789
I mean yeah a Finn's always know English

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,889
but its importance in a b2b relationship

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,410
that the customers can work in their

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,030
native language same applies to Sweden

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,880
and the rest of the world they just get

00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,440
English so yeah the mind somewhere and

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,490
so given this situation we needed to

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,590
decide on what we're gonna do about this

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,900
previously before before I was involved

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,960
in before this project got going on but

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,210
Gento as a platform joyce was considered

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,400
and was not chosen I don't have much

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,830
more to say about that although I do

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,340
want to point out that no platform has

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,479
like built in multilingual support in

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,729
its core

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,659
which like I'm looking at all the people

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,610
now that work on WordPress and

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,340
WooCommerce and ultimate gentle

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,449
developer isn't like that would be great

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,680
because like I said general comments

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,199
it's kind of a problem multilingual

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,150
support is always overlaid in some way

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,379
maybe it's done well maybe it's not not

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,360
so well but there's no obviously good

00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:53,029
choice from a platform or a technology

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,069
perspective and so the end result was

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,159
you know this is Goldilocks are too old

00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:00,139
to you know too hard just right was you

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,870
know the WordPress as a technology basis

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,949
and specifically WooCommerce with the

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,659
multilingual features enabled on top you

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,889
get a basic store we can do all the

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,330
customizations we need for shipping

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,279
methods and special payment methods and

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,550
credit limit checking and and whatnot

00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,129
and we can do the multilingual thing we

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,870
evaluated Shopify and and Shopify has a

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,029
basic restriction that there one

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,860
language at a time you can get like a

00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,069
multilingual overlay it's doable there's

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,520
plugins we can't look at them but it

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,349
seems more of a pack than wpml I think

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
wpml shirts I think is the green one

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,919
multilingual or I've seen some jumpers

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,770
which say multi lingual so I'm wondering

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,789
if this is their staff here if they

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,999
really didn't let me know and we can

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:47,599
talk so what we ended up with was was

00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:49,899
this which is a cool commerce we used

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:55,360
the Commerce multilingual plug-in and

00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:57,979
then the wpml basic translation core and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,300
well just out of curiosity I mentioned

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,569
some others that we use not that it's

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,209
important in this context and the DevOps

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,080
the previous presenter interesting thank

00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,919
you

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,139
we do most of those things we use a git

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,009
flow we use word move to move the

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:21,770
database back and forth interestingly we

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:23,599
have about two hundred thousand files in

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,819
the uploads folder because we were a

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,020
little bit lazy with like managing

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,249
thumbnail creation is a bit about

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,959
necessary thumbnail creation that we

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:31,610
don't always need but the product

00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,950
imagery overall is a couple of hundred

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,500
gigabytes of

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,150
because we do also for unrelated reasons

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,270
we also maintain the original full-size

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:43,750
Tiff's which vary in size starting from

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,740
80 megabytes off to a gigabyte each Plus

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,930
then in our generated thumbnails and and

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,210
special preview images in imagine a

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,890
shower curtain is tall and narrow we

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,780
need to create a square image which has

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,730
like White's filled in on the sides and

00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,830
so all the imagery gets multiplied

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,840
crazily making might have to do

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,010
something about at some point but

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,660
otherwise yeah you know it was

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,090
interesting to hear a presentation there

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,150
was some good pointers which I'll be

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:13,780
picking up for our development anyway to

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:17,320
proceed to the multilingual thing to get

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,490
the product information from perfume

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,850
from the product information management

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,410
system into the store is on the one hand

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,020
it's a one-off operation when we start

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,490
and we deploy the store but that's not

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,600
interesting if it happens once then on

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,480
an ongoing basis

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,190
it must be updated constantly the

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,460
product information is actually updated

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,100
daily within the company spelling

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,200
mistakes may be corrected texts may be

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,960
changed and new products are created

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,230
because in addition to having the

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,310
current product selection in perfume in

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,860
the product information management

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,270
system also like upcoming products that

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,100
are not on sale yet so they're not

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,660
public you can't see them anywhere but

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,790
they're also managed and maintained and

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,370
they are previewed in the system by

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,930
staff and and so those things like you

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,730
know there may be a photography day

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,980
where product photos are taken and then

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,930
those get updated upload it today and

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,150
then tomorrow you know somebody brings

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:14,530
in all the Swedish translations so we

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:18,400
need an ongoing system for for daily

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,470
updates and were thinking was so good to

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,440
read external script you know the

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,480
integration components you know where we

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,850
put it you had external scripts that we

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,670
run with cron that don't have to be

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,310
programmed in PHP at all or what do we

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,520
do and considering that there's already

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,080
an extensive list of customizations you

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,850
know for the for the store to work in

00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,670
the first place

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,649
it seemed inconsistent and an extra

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,389
complexities you have like

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,589
something very different for this part

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:51,059
and so we wrote it as a plugin but it's

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,980
important to notice that we we don't

00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,290
actually run the synchronization itself

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,670
you know from the admins that we don't

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,350
press the sync button in the dashboard

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,050
or have any automation there because

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,519
then you're subject to the timeouts and

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,170
usage restriction memory restrictions

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,230
and timeouts because they're sync can

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,839
run for hours makes no sense like turn

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,050
off all your timeouts and expand your

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,209
memory use limits to like a gigabytes

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,339
within that context but you can run a

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,470
sync from the admin console from the

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,179
dashboard because sometimes we want to

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,649
do a fast update will modify the

00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,059
configuration parameters and say now we

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,980
want just these five products bring them

00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,600
in quickly and it can be convenient to

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,540
be able to trigger a sync from the

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,170
dashboard but primarily we run an

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,829
external script using the command line

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,329
interface and it runs on a cron task

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,660
nightly and it has unlimited memory

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,269
access it has run for as long as it

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,189
likes things like converting images you

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:51,149
need to load the image into memory in

00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:53,790
order to create a JPEG preview we can we

00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,189
do our own typing previews not always

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,439
building on on the WordPress built in

00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:00,959
thumbnail generation and if you have a

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,639
gigabyte sized image you know you need

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,559
to have enough memory allocated to the

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,230
process to read into gigabyte image and

00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,230
then it can create this small video so

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,870
actually bringing in the data from the

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,350
information management system perfumey

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,910
in this particular case offers to api's

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,499
they're very similar the first is a

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,620
generic one which you know historically

00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:27,209
they implemented first it is generic you

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,879
get access to all the product

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:34,230
information but it also provides no sort

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:36,089
of online store related features it

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,660
doesn't help you very much it's

00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:42,389
basically have some examples XML based

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,829
and kind of inspired by SQL statements

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,689
and so you can do queries into the data

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,910
and pull out that which you need and

00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:50,309
they have an e-commerce oriented API

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,559
which for example allows you to define

00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:55,410
channels in finlay since case for

00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,420
example we have this b2b tile which

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,700
allows you to set certain rules

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,460
well what products will be pulled out

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:07,260
which languages will be included in the

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,150
data which product features what

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,370
products data specifically is brought

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,100
out which we different from the consumer

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,810
store for Finland or for the Swedish

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,550
consumer store or for the international

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,920
community consumer store there's

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,540
actually seven Shopify stores that we

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,580
run because there's Finland Sweden

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,620
international for each we have a test

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,700
store where we can test things and then

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,960
there's like a sandbox store where we

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,810
play around with things so we actually

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,030
have eight different ecommerce channels

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,470
defined each with their own different

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,180
configurations so that we can get

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,040
different controlled subsets of the

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,360
product information into these different

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,600
stores in profile you can you can

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,760
organize your product information into a

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,930
structure of product and variation like

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,400
you know you have your bathrobe and it's

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,990
in three colors and three sizes but it's

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,020
kind of the same bathrobe just in

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,510
various variations you can build that

00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,870
straight into the data and then you kind

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,790
of don't need this but often that's not

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,640
the case because the data originates

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,520
from sales and and and and the design

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,340
people and and procurements and and they

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,040
don't organize the data in the way that

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,450
the online store needs so using the

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,930
e-commerce API you kind of overlaid that

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,990
structure on top and I wanted to

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,310
specifically get into some what some of

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,980
this technical stuff because this is

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,720
some of the these are the things that I

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,890
found most specifically interesting but

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,290
I wanted to share with you guys here

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:37,560
today the generic API is XML based it is

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,150
loosely oriented around SQL and so in

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,510
this particular in this example we're

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:46,710
saying gimme finish English and Swedish

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:48,420
contacts it may or may not exist and so

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,800
one problem that we face is sometimes if

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,550
they forget to put in like us the

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,450
Swedish text like well what do we do now

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,740
there's nothing where you can do because

00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,000
of the Swedish text is missing and you

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,280
need to publish this information to the

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,260
Swedish store but you can't generate it

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,380
here you can flag it and stuff like that

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,259
in our case we default to finish it's

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,749
not great

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:09,910
but you're gonna have something rather

00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:12,229
than nothing

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,869
social finish is always our default in

00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:16,459
the case of missing data we ask these

00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:17,749
languages we say feature ID and

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,399
asterisms they would give me everything

00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,689
just for this demo I'm saying give me

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,959
everything we don't really do this

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:28,399
normally because there's about 600

00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:31,009
features defined you get a lot of stuff

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,410
and I'm saying in this example just give

00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,029
me this one product in our daily

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,739
synchronization we don't say give me one

00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,509
product we say give me this defined

00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:41,179
subset of everything and we'll get

00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:46,429
typically about 1,500 products in one

00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:48,889
run we asked the three languages and so

00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:52,489
in the response the first part of the

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:58,100
response is metadata on the product what

00:15:52,489 --> 00:16:01,039
is the information about the features

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,359
that we're gonna get and so i highlights

00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,529
it's not actually a great example but

00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,470
you can see it to repeated three times

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,269
because there's English Finnish Swedish

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,049
the idea is the same this one seven five

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:15,139
two it's the same feature marketing text

00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:16,910
but it's in three languages and and the

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,489
you don't get content here yet but this

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,619
feature is called product type in

00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:24,139
English and totally plain finished and

00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:25,759
prod type in Swedish and in this

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,739
specific example there's actually two

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,359
thousand lines of stuff because we have

00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:30,799
about six hundred features each is in

00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:34,249
three languages and so you know you it

00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,079
all multiplies out crazily next part of

00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,309
the response is the actual product

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,779
information you can see is a product

00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:44,419
internal ID it shows in the first line

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,489
that value says if the SKU did not

00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:48,230
localize this just once they don't have

00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:49,519
it in the product code in English and

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,989
Swedish and Finnish that's always the

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,970
same there's a barcode somewhere or for

00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:58,189
example the designer year you see it

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,289
halfway through it's just once so that's

00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:02,059
not in three languages that exist that's

00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:03,350
not a localizable feature it's just a

00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,019
one language feature it's a number

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,850
answer comes through once barcode once

00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,639
designer year once but for example

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,649
product title we can see it here in

00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:13,929
English assist think of me and Bob

00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,049
that's how it's a movie character

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:22,980
obviously khufu

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:26,209
I'm Swedish hemispheres and this is the

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,549
generic API so there's no structuring of

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,679
product and variation and and what are

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,799
the parameters on which the variations

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,720
very like size and color but this is

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,740
used in certain contexts and especially

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,080
for debugging this can be great the

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,740
similar query using the e-commerce API

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,740
is more oriented now towards natural

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,659
webstore we can say I'll get products we

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,350
say what channel so which store are we

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,429
asking for give us the b2b configuration

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,870
and that will give us certain values

00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,520
that says include mappings is asterisk

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,880
we will get those mappings that are

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,980
defined for the b2b store mappings means

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,750
what feature data we get what product

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,029
information is actually given out of the

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,940
of the six hundred features total that

00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:13,890
we have for each products we want summon

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,659
for this store and then we say you know

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,039
here's the product code again for this

00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,620
example it's just a single code I'm

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,230
asking for normally you know will save

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,149
give us fifteen hundred at a time

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,399
they actually batch it into about fifty

00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:28,890
or hundred at a time we don't actually

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:31,649
pull out fifteen hundred it system times

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,960
are you trying and then the result again

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,590
is organized more in a more structured

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
way

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,100
this product has fields and this is on

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,659
the product level so again to take the

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,120
example of a bathrobe which has three

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:44,309
colors and three sizes each of that

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,510
creates nine different variations each

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,460
having a particular color in a

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,409
particular size but then they all shared

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,929
much of the same product information in

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:54,149
general and so this is that general

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,740
product information we can see body HTML

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,830
specifically oriented to the webstore

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,120
that here's how the products description

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,350
near the content for the product

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,270
description so in wool commerce that

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,830
becomes literally one-to-one that's the

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:11,309
product description field title what is

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,919
the name of the products etc but again P

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,289
for example is not in three languages

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,070
because because that value does not vary

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,070
by language

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,960
and here you can accidentally see some

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:27,480
custom stuff we have that this is sell

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
only two countries so there is some

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,950
license restriction saying that Finland

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,000
it's not permitted to sell this product

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,120
to certain countries I've no idea why

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
like I don't know don't know more about

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,470
that but it is our requirements and so

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,210
that's part of the product information

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,040
these products may not result of their

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,190
countries and so if a customer of the

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,110
b2b webstore logs in we know who they

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,700
are we know what company they're

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,620
associated with they login as an

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,320
individual but they're associated with a

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,940
certain business customer who is look

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,400
you know officially located as a Finnish

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,870
customer or Chilean customer or from

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Thailand or Japan and then based on that

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:08,340
we are we do filter not multilingual

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,140
specific but because it shows up here we

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,150
also get information on so for this

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,549
product what are the ways in which the

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,520
variations vary I don't know why the

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:19,260
size came twice the weird bug I noticed

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,850
it just this morning but here we're

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,220
being told this product has variations

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:27,210
and they will vary based on size and

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:29,640
color somebody who does cars you know

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,530
they it'll vary on engine size and if

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,900
you do screws you'll bury on thread

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,240
counts and things right but for textiles

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,650
is typically always color in size we get

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,470
this information and again in three

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,059
languages so that when we show the

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,340
information on the web store we can use

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,960
the right language just to say what

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,940
we're talking about

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,669
interesting that Swedish translation

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,590
seems to be missing for for color and so

00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:54,720
it defaults to the technical name the

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,440
internal name somebody has to fix that's

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,660
it then the variants have information

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,100
for example the thread-count ironing

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,049
instructions they may vary like every

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,429
t-shirt in three colors the black has

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,270
special washing instructions but the

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,040
others have different washing

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,470
instructions so in addition to varying

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,460
by color the variations may have

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,500
different information images again

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,059
images can be localized you can have an

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,440
English image and a Finnish image and

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,630
the Swedish image in this particular

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,280
case we don't really have that

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,550
very much in lesson two always the same

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,650
but this multilingual feature of perfume

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,480
applies to all features including images

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,330
and if there were for example different

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,450
Finnish Swedish and English product

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:40,130
images then they would be represented as

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:42,710
as multiple image elements here on the

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,700
first one you can see these bytes are

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,800
the the actual was a base64 encoded

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,570
content comes through here we made that

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,250
choice it's just technically slightly

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,780
convenient the JPEG images are not very

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,970
big so it's kind of okay for them to

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,040
come through directly it makes the

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,830
requests the response is quite large but

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,420
it is convenient but then the the main

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,080
images which I think here you can see

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,520
this the TIFF image gif we're like you

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,590
know if you want this image can get it

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,770
from this URL if we don't base encode

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:15,290
those into the response and then we say

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,830
this one this particular product is its

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:22,820
color is blue and its size is this thing

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,310
we localize the size because mostly it's

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:29,060
always the same but by localizing the

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:31,490
size we enable using commas or full

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:35,300
stops periods as the decimal which is

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:39,560
kind of neat and when you have like one

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,990
size is a size we can say that in in

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,910
three languages if it were just a

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,460
centimeter number a whole number we

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,140
wouldn't need to localize the size but

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,410
but we do localize the exercise

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,440
information as well all right so this is

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,090
the information that comes out of the

00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,790
product system now we need to put it

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:03,170
into the store and I was wondering in my

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,730
people may or may not be familiar with

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,400
this already but I had to put this in

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:11,000
that the way WooCommerce works as an

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,630
extension of WordPress is that a main

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
product like bathrobe is a custom post

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,500
type and there's some techno tech sodomy

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
terms which identify what kind of

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,590
product is it simple grouped variable

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,800
and there's a fourth which other

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,420
remember external or something but in

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,010
our case always variable it's always

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,720
like bathrobe three sizes three colors

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,030
or like

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,400
pillow in key sizes things like that and

00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,429
then the variations again are a custom

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,880
post type and their parent post both

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,169
parents indicates where they belong and

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,150
again there's more autonomies to

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,720
indicate like what is the size what is

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:51,159
the color and we we transfer information

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,500
of the variations into the appropriate

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,330
WooCommerce taxonomy so that they are

00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,940
displayed properly in the right

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:02,799
languages but this is just for language

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,650
what we know whatever the default

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,330
WordPress WooCommerce installation is in

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,700
our case we use the WooCommerce

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:14,799
multilingual plug-in which builds upon

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,380
DWP ml things and it duplicates

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,030
everything and when I when I first found

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,710
of course this few years back when I

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,780
started working this is ridiculous like

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,549
y know why don't we build the Mae

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,190
nothing but but the other option is also

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,350
not good if you start trying to bake in

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,049
multiple languages into the same post

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,520
type well first of all WordPress doesn't

00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:35,400
really allow that you can't really do

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,919
that I know the about the dental worship

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,510
this is just what you have to do it and

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,580
it's fine but you do get a lot of

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,890
entries in your in your tables

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,770
everything is duplicated all attachments

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:52,090
are duplicated supplicant because we

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:55,150
have three languages what it works each

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,409
of the on each level the the product

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,760
level bathro of group of active Arak

00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,990
they are they have a translation ID

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,900
which ties them together so we know

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:04,090
which is the translation of which and

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,020
one is always the source language it

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,340
doesn't make a big difference to the

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,360
end-user they don't see anything but

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,100
technically we know which was the

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,039
original and then these are translations

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,419
of that

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,419
and the same applies to all variations

00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,549
so you get Elementary's which is fine we

00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:23,530
only have about for example in one

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,049
particular instance of a store we have

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,539
about 1200 products but like our post ID

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,070
count is already like 200,000 just just

00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,929
from our development of products and

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,669
products out develop update you know and

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,280
then the existing counter keeps going so

00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,230
you get into big numbers on but it works

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,400
so thank you to all the wpml

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:44,750
contributors

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,490
it's a good system and then finally some

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,970
comments on on actually creating

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,190
products this is where there was some

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:58,610
challenges because WooCommerce has a

00:25:52,190 --> 00:26:00,320
good PHP PHP function API for getting

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,660
information so if you're writing a

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,040
plug-in like we do you can get

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,360
information buttload of product you've

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,830
asked to the children you get the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,440
information but there's nothing for

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:12,440
creating programmatically there's some

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,240
extensions to the WP REST API so if

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,700
you're calling REST API for externally

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,580
you can say create a product create a

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,440
variation but we decided not to do that

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,270
there wasn't a good decision not quite

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,540
sure but you know we wanted to do the

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,370
coding in the plug-in same thing for the

00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,210
multilingual stuff wpml itself plus the

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,480
WCML which is the MU commerce

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:39,490
multilingual also there's no set of PHP

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,200
functions for creating stuff so

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,490
everything that I know now has been

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,710
basically reverse engineered because

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,110
there's also no snow documentation for

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,760
this the only thing I've not done is

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:53,780
I've not actually been specifically in

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,540
contact with the WP Emma or WCML teams

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,000
maybe I should now but looking online

00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,830
for information people ask about this

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,050
and then the moderators on the wpml WCML

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,970
forms like yeah we don't have that okay

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,320
so I've been digging around in the

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,179
database I mean now I know how it works

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,410
because I reversed engineered the whole

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,550
thing and I'm thinking there if I want

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,820
to be rich and famous now I need to

00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,010
write like a library which does this it

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,170
would be awesome I would I would pay a

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,330
lot of money and I will charge my

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,650
customer that money just someone who

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:31,340
writes a code library for writing

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:33,050
creating products in commerce and doing

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,640
it multilingual that would be really

00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,010
valuable as we spend a lot of time

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,530
having to do it ourselves by reverse

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,929
engineering a final comment on the

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,190
synchronization process that we run it

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:45,500
smells very straightforward but it was

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,090
not obvious like doing it you know it's

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,640
obvious now that we know I can write in

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,470
here it took us a while to kind of

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,539
figure out what makes sense

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,629
we find first what are the products that

00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,700
we want in the particular store it's

00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:01,019
always a subset of of everything it's

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,149
never everything it's always some things

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,259
for example upcoming products that are

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,999
not public yet of course we don't want

00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:09,479
those historical products not being

00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:10,919
produced anymore no point we do a fast

00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,159
prefetch because performance can be a

00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,479
problem talking to the first year on API

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,869
sometimes you have to do everything

00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:20,970
within about 60 seconds or it complains

00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:23,669
so we ask for give us all the IDS based

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,470
on that and the SKU use the product

00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:28,349
codes then we do a simple comparison we

00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,960
say well what products do we know in our

00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:32,580
store now and then what are the products

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,049
that we're supposed to have and we just

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,519
compare them well here's what you know

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,729
there's new products that we don't know

00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,169
about

00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:39,330
okay we need to create these products

00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:41,489
and then we have products in the store

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,899
which are not included in this query

00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,279
response so if you got to delete these

00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:47,429
products because they're going away and

00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,109
then the recipe update for boring

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,970
reasons we can't use last modified time

00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:51,989
stamps which is really annoying which

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,970
means that we always have tape

00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:55,649
everything which we don't actually know

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,019
what has changed I don't know why I

00:28:55,649 --> 00:29:00,749
can't ask afterwards which is why the

00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:03,629
database thief this process runs for

00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:05,700
about 3 to 6 hours we did nicely and

00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:09,239
it's fine and we might need to make it

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,989
better later but it's ok for now then

00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:15,269
using the awesomeness of the WP command

00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:17,789
line interface we wrote this as a plugin

00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:21,320
we get to use all the WordPress and WCML

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:23,700
and wpml features and utility functions

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,409
but then we use like you know a gigabyte

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,139
of memory and it runs for 5 hours we can

00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:32,820
run it outside I'm only recent from

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:35,220
India WP CLI so cool we had trouble the

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,820
timeouts in the dashboard previously but

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,940
that's uh that's it from my side thank

00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,940
you

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,000
[Applause]

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,150
hold all for a second you have time for

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,790
questions first of all thank you it

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,160
bring me a little bit more but I'm still

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:01,610
kind of what the hell is going on at

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,250
least I know that is yeah at least I

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:08,270
know that it's really hard to have

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:11,180
multilingual online store I do get that

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:15,530
annoying yeah and I kind of appreciate

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:18,530
that you was kind of telling the points

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:20,930
that you had developed that concise

00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:25,040
summary now we have time for questions

00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:28,520
yeah go for it hello I have two

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,280
questions actually the first one is how

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,800
did you manage with that amount of

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,830
uploads how did you manage to work with

00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,750
it efficiently like going from local to

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,510
a staging to a production because I mean

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:44,300
obviously you you you take the files

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,270
from production and and down but if you

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,280
have like hundreds of gigs that's a

00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:54,050
nightmare isn't it how did you manage

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:56,450
great pain and suffering you have two

00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,800
hundred thirty five thousand files two

00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,600
hundred and thirty three gigabytes and

00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,240
we use word move which is basically our

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,670
sync to move it around and it's really

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,080
painful having said that just a sec um

00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,810
the the Delta from day to day is not

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,390
huge right so once upon a time I ran

00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,910
word move I think everything down to

00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,530
this laptop right here which is as it

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,060
was maxed out years ago it has a

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,920
terabyte on it and I had to like clean

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,090
up your huge amount of space which is

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,300
very annoying because Mike also my

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:28,490
personal laptop so I had to make like

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,750
250 gigabytes of space and then I synced

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,790
everything down and it ran for about a

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,160
week and then I had everything from

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,290
perfume that great not on my laptop and

00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,740
it took another week to push it up to

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,630
our staging environments and and and

00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,550
then it took in another week to go to

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,830
production so it I spent about three

00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,540
weeks with my laptop open charged online

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,650
all the time just and it was I would go

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,390
into work and come home

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,360
and then laptop was always open and in

00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,950
my car and any ridiculous but now that

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,870
it's done the Delta from day to day is

00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:00,710
not bad but our sink does struggle

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,470
hugely it fails mostly I want to get

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:06,830
successful our sink about 175 times I

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,150
run it it's a problem it's not a big

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,110
problem that the consumer is like oh my

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,150
goodness this doesn't work or my

00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,100
customers happy but yeah it's a problem

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,350
for us

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,790
sounds serious horrible the others of

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,850
this fine ratchets worth it but yeah

00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:24,770
this is annoying my other question is

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:28,820
how come you chose wpml as multilingual

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:32,270
and and the the the background is that

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,770
mi myself has actually been sued for for

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:39,610
and lost in court for using W or I we

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:44,030
had a we helped a client who had wpml

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:46,910
wpml and there were works in wpml and if

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:51,110
anyone else has used wpml you know that

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:55,670
there are lots of them in wpml because

00:32:51,110 --> 00:33:00,920
the whole is a bit wonky as you might

00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:02,930
have noted and well how is it working

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,590
out for you because like the judge said

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:09,410
hey Jimmy you know if you're an expert

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,720
in in in WordPress you should probably

00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:22,370
know that you shouldn't use this I was

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:25,580
like well what can I say that the main

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:28,420
problem was that the client did not

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,520
understand that you know in open-source

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,080
no one is really responsible for for the

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,060
end product yeah you know I mean you

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,090
sell your time and to help them

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,450
customize but in court the judge did not

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,710
agree it was judge considerate a product

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,580
and we should know better

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:50,360
probably so now we we use we use a

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:53,720
multilingual press instead and I would

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,410
say that it is a much better solution

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,360
and it has never cost us any issues

00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,270
good to know hey I'll use that next time

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,710
I will use Bobby PML because honestly a

00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,130
good friend recommended it said this is

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,100
great

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,010
Trustin is my colleague and man I was

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,780
fine now okay with regard to open source

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,580
components and technical issues and bugs

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,370
and things I have always made it clear

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,740
to all my customers like ever that's

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,060
gonna use open source I highly recommend

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,169
using open source we don't use open

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,310
source here's you know here's the

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:24,110
alternative cost for now I'm going to

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,460
recode this whole thing you know so you

00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,100
make it clear that it's a good idea to

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,679
do open source but hey you know if there

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,570
are bugs I'm not responsible no right

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,159
and I put that into the contract and I

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,300
make sure that the customer understands

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,040
what's happening they're not just fine

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,800
print that they don't get i'm make it

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,530
completely clear so far my customers I

00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,780
believe have understood this and it's

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,050
baked into the contract explicitly yeah

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,929
if there is a defect in the open source

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:53,510
component I am NOT responsible but I I

00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:56,270
do contractually obligated ooh my best

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,620
to a fix it right in the actual

00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,410
component itself that would be great

00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,360
cool I get to contribute or to develop a

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,830
workaround but I will charge by the hour

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,990
for that and if it doesn't work I'm like

00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,820
sorry yeah I always always cover my back

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,980
from that perspective yeah it has not

00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,510
been a problem but I'm I hope to be

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,160
prepared for this case yeah we had a lot

00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,440
of the problems with the check out and

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,920
and you know small things that didn't

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
work and broke and I always that you've

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,550
seen those myself hopefully I won't see

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,930
them enemy next guys there's a common

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:30,170
hands at least that I think you were

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:33,320
first and then here and then here thank

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:37,340
you it is very interesting regarding the

00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,490
images we have a we have a client where

00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:45,050
we import daily or many times they used

00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:47,180
cars that they sell and then they of

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,880
course results in the heavy really much

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,920
images on the on the on the production

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,870
server so what would you and one on our

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,320
devs dev environment is that we have in

00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:59,320
our htaccess file so that it if it

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,600
doesn't find the image local it just

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,000
loads that image from the live site

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,550
instead so that I don't have to ever

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,550
take the uploads to my local we have one

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,040
paper with my colleague we have designed

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,710
and unplanned - implements once it

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,040
becomes too painful we'll probably move

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:20,740
the whole uploads into Amazon s3 bucket

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,690
and link to it from everywhere yeah it

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,400
causes different kinds of problems then

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,440
because your because all environments

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,910
share it and is it in sync in it you

00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,619
kind of exchanging one problem for a

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,869
different problem right now we struggle

00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,690
with the word move or sync thing because

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:36,460
even though it's problematic when the

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,930
are thing does go through were cleanly

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,340
separated in our environments and we

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,230
don't have weird side effects I just

00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,060
need to retry all the time and like you

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,760
know every few days I get a full thing

00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,700
and then and then we're good and then I

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,850
want to just do your two questions do

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,530
you run the loading the import script on

00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,510
the same server as you host it or a

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,210
different server you run on the same

00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,490
server okay that's just accidents we

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,020
don't need to do elsewise when and if we

00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,650
need to or we all want to separately

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,840
okay

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,300
and then have you ever encountered where

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,110
you need to have different product

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:15,700
images per country instead of per

00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:18,700
language no okay but the solution we

00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,880
have for filtering products based on

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:24,670
customer based on customers customer

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,220
group probably we would be able to adapt

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:29,080
that so so no we haven't done that but I

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,070
think that this stuff we've done

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,420
probably would be straightforwardly

00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:38,430
expandable to to do that we've done

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,430
something very similar okay thank you

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,870
so first of all thank you for a good

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,480
talk and I feel sorry for you having to

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:55,130
work on so paper I feel you so client is

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,200
yeah I'm probably just having my own

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,620
opinions on it I'm not gonna to do them

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,480
now secondly do you did you have any

00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,820
problems regarding to like performance

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,160
and issues regarding that yeah thinking

00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,900
it's a big site and how did you solve

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,030
them if you could give an examples

00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,850
biggest performance problem we had was a

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,250
bug in WooCommerce which is gonna be

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,870
fixed soon don't render the numbers and

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:25,310
the codes but it's not actually in a

00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:28,580
release yet where it would a stupid

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:31,820
number of cron jobs are created to

00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,830
delete version transients I hadn't been

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,820
interested enough to dig any deeper I

00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,780
can I can point you to it and that

00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,990
completely kills the site because then

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,620
there's like 5,000 entries WP options

00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,360
for chrome jobs and I just and and and I

00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,980
just if when and if that happens

00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,140
sometimes happens when lots of products

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,570
are synced are the day to day Delta

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,280
coming from the product information -

00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,870
system is not huge but sometimes it's

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,180
big like a whole collection is released

00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,560
and we get a lot and that's just I'm

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,970
just waiting for that about to be fixed

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,220
in it we'll commerce some update and

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:07,760
right now I literally I just I just kill

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,770
at p.m. and I just delete that totally

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,290
brute force it's really nice although

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,450
today I learned actually one of the

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,400
presentations had a couple of lines of

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,470
code uh-huh maybe maybe that was solve

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,970
my problem otherwise performance no it's

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,130
not really a problem we have a

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,510
medium-size server it's just one we

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,420
don't we don't run a farm or anything

00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,970
that the absolute number of customers is

00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,040
not huge or the volume of business is

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,080
pretty big because its consumers its

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,970
corporate customers coming in to make

00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,480
large or like for hotel they'll buy like

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,760
a thousand towels at a time for example

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,130
we have a medium sized server with no

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,820
special special performance oriented

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,270
configurations so far thank you now it's

00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,270
disgustin

00:39:51,240 --> 00:40:00,850
yeah so actually it's right in a

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,820
near-future I'm building a kind of

00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:06,850
similar setup with little less products

00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:09,880
a little less complexity I'm gonna use

00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:12,130
polygon roll for that and I can tell the

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,280
results later but my question is really

00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:18,130
about time estimates like how long did

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,860
it take for you to setup the blocking

00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,190
that synchronizes things and the common

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:28,150
savings and such because I don't wanna

00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:35,170
give - yeah - positive estimates or doom

00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:36,820
day estimate the in this context the the

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:40,540
thing that has taken time is simply

00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,790
writing the code that read that the stop

00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,070
starting from you know so clients you

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,230
make a request you formulate the query

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:50,260
XML make the request you get the

00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,240
response that I was I was almost gonna

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,660
draw a picture of this you get the XML

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,050
response

00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,970
I have domain classes in PHP just to

00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,740
represent exactly that XML no

00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,900
transformations yet into who commerce

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,610
products I just take the XML and I

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,770
represent that in PHP just so that I

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,030
have that without so client I don't

00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,720
don't actually want to talk to so polite

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:13,510
I want PHP class representations but one

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,980
to one of that XML data from and from

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:21,850
there I will then make a transformation

00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:25,270
into my own domain classes which do not

00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,340
follow this model because just how my

00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:30,220
brain works and I need to know my code I

00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,410
so I have a bunch of classes which have

00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,120
for example products but it is a

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,470
multilingual product like when I make

00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,640
that super awesome library which will

00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,380
make me rich and famous it'll be based

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,060
on this where I have a single class

00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,120
which represents an arbitrarily

00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:46,210
multilingual products and that is then

00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,430
able to create this stuff into the

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,500
database and I kind of mix doing stuff

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,350
directly into the database mostly I try

00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,480
to be a good citizen and I use WP

00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,290
functions sometimes I'm like okay this

00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,390
is ridiculous

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,780
I dive straight into the database but

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:06,760
then you skip filters and things doing

00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,770
this overall was about two months of

00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,720
work two months to three months

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,660
including and the original develop was

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,170
too and then further work is another one

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,710
so the total investment in efforts has

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,420
been approximately three months to

00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:27,369
create this synchronization that I

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,600
described thank you I'm gonna block your

00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:30,480
little business you're gonna ask

00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,760
privately because we don't have time for

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,060
many questions I can hang around

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,970
Devereaux

00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,800
on the back I think was one head up I

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,330
think we're gonna need to have that as a

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
last question you're gonna ask also

00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,070
probably afterwards so everyone got

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,020
hahaha break we do break between the

00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,570
last speeches but you can definitely ask

00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:54,850
after this so last question goes from

00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:59,080
here hello great talk they were

00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:02,290
questioned about performance but half

00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:06,790
year round with Black Friday's

00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:10,150
performance and how to sing keep all the

00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:13,960
multilingual stuck and stuff sync it on

00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:22,350
he'll like tons tons of requests per

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:22,350
second for all the multilingual no

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,349
this thing's like Black Friday Christmas

00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,240
sales Easter sales summer sales don't

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:34,660
apply to this particular store because

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,410
it's corporate customers and we don't

00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:41,500
get load peaks like that it's the

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,420
absolute load of users on the system is

00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,760
