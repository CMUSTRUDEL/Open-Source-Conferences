Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Laura talks about content design as part of the design process:
– Why and when you need a content designer
– What content a designer brings to the design process
– What are the benefits for the client/team/product
Since the content design is still a bit rare or a new thing in Finland and the Nordics, she’s also going to talk about what is needed to become a content designer and how content is and can be part of agile development.

thank you yes I'm really happy about

00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,650
being here and being able to talk about

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,450
something that I'm really passionate

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,390
about and that is contents and design so

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,510
my topic today is going to be or I hope

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,699
that after my short lightening talk you

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,130
will understand why you need a content

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,390
designer and what does a content

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,969
designer do and probably also what are

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,550
the benefits of having having a content

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,820
designer for the project and the clients

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,670
I'm not going to talk about me but you

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,739
can find me at Twitter and LinkedIn and

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,100
yes I'm going to talk about content

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,190
designers I could be talking about UX

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,940
writers copies content strategists and

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,610
so forth

00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:01,710
but I think the word content designer is

00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:05,180
describes the best what we do so why do

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,220
people normally come to your site or app

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,210
because of Awesome code because of great

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,150
UX or because of beautiful visuals well

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:20,490
they are of course all really important

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:23,310
but they are probably not the because

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,490
people come to your site they come for

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,540
the content good content great content

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,960
even and I think it's actually

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:38,549
impossible to design a great user

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,579
experience with bad content content is

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:46,170
king we've been we've been hearing this

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,149
kind of phrase at least a decade I think

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,890
it's what it was really popular in the

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,079
early days of content marketing ads and

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:59,009
some advertising agencies maybe still

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,850
use this kind of phrase and content

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,880
first this should be more more familiar

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,080
to you at least I've heard it many times

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,319
in different podcasts read in different

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,040
blog posts and so forth and we always

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,000
like to

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,659
that we do design content first but are

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,760
we do really doing so and can we really

00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:29,310
do you so when we think of a normal

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,060
design process I think it normally looks

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,280
like this we do you resort

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,659
research and discoveries normally a

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,790
designer is here in the beginning we

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:46,230
visualize decides prototype we test

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:52,379
sometimes we are coding when the when

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:55,290
the content comes in and I think this is

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:59,190
a quite familiar design process for you

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:03,000
and and it sometimes happens to me also

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,690
and if we design like this then I have

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,859
to say that yes we we really do have a

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:14,909
problem and I'm going to highlight two

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:17,579
of the biggest problem problems that

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:24,359
will come with this kind of design

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:26,190
process well first of all the content

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,260
designer needs to understand all the

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,129
same things as the designer and if the

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,090
content designer comes to the process

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:37,799
later on he or she are actually I am

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,930
going to start to ask all the same

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,389
questions as the designer I want to

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,459
understand user needs user problems I

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,500
want to understand the business goals

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,440
and I want to understand the context

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,419
where we are designing plus I had some

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,299
more questions I would like to hear how

00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,949
people are talking about they problems

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,069
and and needs what kind of vocabulary

00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:04,440
they are using or what kind of terms and

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:06,900
when I come in later in the process and

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,419
start to ask the same things as the

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,829
designer has already done well that

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,530
makes me really annoying teammates and

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,630
the other big problem I think is what I

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,729
like to call a lorem ipsum we do a lot

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:25,010
of design with lorem ipsum and what's

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,010
the problem with that

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:33,620
well let's imagine that here's an event

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,460
teaser in your landing page it looks

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,410
quite neat sorry it doesn't show really

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,960
good but you can imagine it it's

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,000
designed with lorem ipsum it looks nice

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,300
you can have like two or three of those

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,080
on your site and then comes a template

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,700
text or probably something that's

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,950
designer has visualized it looks good

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,870
but if there hasn't been a content

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,400
designer if there hasn't been someone

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:04,580
who talks to the stakeholders and and so

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,040
forth it probably in a real life is

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,470
going to look like this well a horror

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,660
case on your landing page the other one

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,390
the other problem with lorem ipsum is

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,070
that if you do testing with lorem ipsum

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,620
or template text if you say to your

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:26,210
users that hey let let's imagine this a

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:30,110
nice article or here's a CTA and so

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,420
forth well what kind of test results are

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,690
you going to get you get if you if you

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:39,050
test with lorem ipsum I don't think that

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:44,840
your test results are going to be really

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:47,600
good so my suggestion is of course that

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,300
you take a content designer within the

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,880
design process from the day one we have

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:59,960
lot to give during the whole whole

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,080
journey let me take an example I think

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,870
slack is something that we copywriters

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,640
and content designers love to use and

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,970
there's a reason why we love these

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,280
brands so much they are consistent since

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:19,250
the way that they talk has been designed

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:24,190
with a care from the day one and they

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:28,430
have a unique way of saying things and

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,710
they are not just entertaining and funny

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,290
they also know what they are talking

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:36,650
about they had this business side of

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,450
things so the benefits of having a

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,849
content in the process from the

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,399
beginning

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,639
is that your site speaks the same

00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,580
language as your users if your users are

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,029
for example talking about buying a house

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,520
you you are not going to talk about them

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:56,240
about taking alone you've been testing

00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:07,949
your site's sorry

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:10,319
don't know what to do now yep you've

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,779
tested your service with the real

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,029
content and you know it works and

00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,669
because because you know it works you're

00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,699
really happy to market your site because

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:23,189
when when people find it they will be

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,919
more than delighted they are even going

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:30,089
to love it I think a lot of times you

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,099
put a lot of effort in content of some

00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:34,589
kind of marketing concepts and so forth

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,749
so you are marketing something that's

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:40,800
when people find it they are going to be

00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:44,399
like same old same old but we want

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,809
people to love the sides and the product

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:51,029
itself and not to forget the content

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,669
answers to your business needs and

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:57,329
drives your goals the goals the contents

00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:03,509
in the side drives your goals your sales

00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:06,899
and your business but I'm not saying

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,939
that content is the king or content

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,569
should come first I don't even think

00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:15,419
that is it's possible to have a design

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:17,939
process where where we have all the

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,279
content and then we start to design or

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,529
maybe maybe that kind of sentence is

00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:26,159
some kind of artifact attacked from the

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:32,759
time at times when people were having

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:37,199
more like a waterfall --is-- projects so

00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:41,909
yes this is this is not my my idea of a

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:44,610
good design with content I think that

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,430
the collaboration between a designer and

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,970
and content designer is the key doing

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,590
doing content without design and doing

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,510
design without content

00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:01,770
it's just impossible the great user

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:05,520
experience or customer experience is not

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:09,150
possible to decide without all all the

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,210
skills involved in in the team so I

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:18,320
think design content tech and analytics

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:23,279
should be working or doing a great

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:27,380
collaboration so my final thoughts and

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:32,330
some takeaways you should in my opinion

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:36,180
take home so next time when you start a

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,430
project take a content designer in the

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,400
team from the day one this was kind of

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,100
obvious and taking a content designer in

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,580
the day in the project from the day one

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:52,020
will save your time money and

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,970
everybody's nerves and always we be

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,790
doubting if your client says that they

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,820
are going to deliver the content on time

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,610
I've seen it so many in so many cases

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,339
it's not going to happen

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,430
you will have those empty pop boxes when

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,390
you start to gold code and this is the

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:17,910
alert signal that you have you should

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:20,910
call a content designer and my final

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,310
thought even if you're a great great

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:27,150
writer doesn't always mean that you can

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,980
write in a digital context this relates

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,900
to the other thing that's that the

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,300
client says that oh yes they are going

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,490
to deliver the content and then they are

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,320
going to say oh we have communications

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,140
we have marketing and they can write the

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,930
content but writing in a digital context

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,770
context is a skill have having a real

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,740
really good customer experience with

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,320
your content is a skill and that's why

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:59,900
you should bring a content designer into

00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:02,510
the project so I was really happy

00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,980
happy to be here and to be able to talk

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:10,850
about contents and I'm also really happy

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,140
to share thoughts with you during the

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,550
lunch break and and in the evening thank

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,179
you so much

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,179
