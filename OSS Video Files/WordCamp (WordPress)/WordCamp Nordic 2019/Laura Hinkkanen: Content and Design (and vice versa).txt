Title: Laura Hinkkanen: Content and Design (and vice versa)
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Laura talks about content design as part of the design process:
– Why and when you need a content designer
– What content a designer brings to the design process
– What are the benefits for the client/team/product
Since the content design is still a bit rare or a new thing in Finland and the Nordics, she’s also going to talk about what is needed to become a content designer and how content is and can be part of agile development.
