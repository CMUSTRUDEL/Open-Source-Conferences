Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Mobile first! Yes, but how?
In a heavily optimised marketing environment, the one room where growth is still a work-in-progress is mobile.
In this presentation, I will showcase how we leveraged the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) framework by Google, to increase our mobile traffic and help our business grow.
I will show how we integrated WordPress with AMP, the advantages and disadvantages, and how to start building an AMP template yourself.
