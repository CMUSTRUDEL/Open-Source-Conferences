Title: Kristoffe Biglete: How We Grew Our Blog Mobile Traffic by 800%
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Nordic 2019
Description: 
	Mobile first! Yes, but how?
In a heavily optimised marketing environment, the one room where growth is still a work-in-progress is mobile.
In this presentation, I will showcase how we leveraged the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) framework by Google, to increase our mobile traffic and help our business grow.
I will show how we integrated WordPress with AMP, the advantages and disadvantages, and how to start building an AMP template yourself.

hi everyone thank you for having me

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:15,260
so as the title of my talk spoiled the

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:19,560
end of the movie we wanted to improve

00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,960
our mobile traffic so what we wanted to

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,480
do here is that we identify the problem

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,090
and try to fix this so our presentation

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,980
is about not the end process because

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,500
it's already here we increase our block

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,780
traffic that is also how as many

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,950
developers are in the room they all can

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,390
relate is how we identify the cause what

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,360
kind of solution we try to be able to

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,340
put in place and basically how we also

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,110
measure the results little bells me I'm

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,140
the only Danish speaker and I'm not even

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,530
Danish I live in Denmark for 10 years I

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,210
work for a company called Falcon IO in

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,539
working with WordPress for as long as I

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
remember 10 years and this my life and

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,719
memory

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,790
there's no that's not going to be any

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,090
question but as mentioned if you have

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,229
questions after this you can either

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,939
Richmond Twitter or talk to me later so

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,479
just to provide some context what

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,240
sallekhana you do which a SAS company

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:26,640
will provide platform to handle social

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,689
media in in a single platform so from

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,189
publishing advertising engaging etc etc

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:37,770
that's context context is important here

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,479
because part of the problem is that why

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,159
did you want to increase our mobile

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,720
traffic in the first place

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,930
this is marketing technology landscape

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,700
5,000 graph it's something that tells us

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,240
that this is all our competitors we're

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,369
one small dot in in the space and we

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,479
have as a brand to be vocal to be

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:05,670
deliver our message fast and better and

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,879
working in marketing one of my job is to

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,970
be sure that our message can be in front

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,780
of the line

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:20,890
I also have technology and my tool were

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,280
tool set we use innovation as pillar of

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,240
growth so we measure everything and

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,650
technology is a way for us to achieve

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,360
that goal we identify biggest room for

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,940
opportunities there's many project that

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,000
we can launch but we are just so many

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,670
people who are able to do that so we use

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,450
data to measure both impact to measure

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:47,430
what problem and we test fast jail fast

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:51,510
and sheikhs fast at least we tried it

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:58,360
won the opportunity that we saw was that

00:02:51,510 --> 00:03:01,360
in 2017 our mobile website marketing

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,910
mobile website was not optimized at all

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,970
we had it responsive and all that it was

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,950
working but it was extremely slow and

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,840
we're not pushing any paid or social

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,680
comes into it we're just trying to get

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,970
some organic from SEO but it represented

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,920
only 13% of our overall website sessions

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,489
so one of the thing that we wanted to

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,660
work with is a MP accelerated mobile

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:32,410
pages which is a framework made by

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:35,400
Google and a year ago it was still very

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:40,180
experimental we implemented it in

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,940
February 2018 it was not even one point

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,920
C Road then it was zero point three or

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,540
something and the framework was evolving

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:52,989
super fast and I'm going to dig into it

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,810
first is why am p so this is these are

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,660
numbers that were are taken from alberta

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:03,489
Medina's talk from working europe last

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,630
year he works at Google 63% of mobile

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,820
site visitor

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,110
just leave the site if it loads after

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,630
three set of three seconds and you lose

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,540
conversion for every second of delay and

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,450
from five second to 19 seconds load on

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,829
mobile you can you can link it to two

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,120
times of revenue

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:29,229
I invite you to look at his talk on

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:33,009
WordPress TV so a MP looked like a

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,800
pretty promising solution for us so

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:38,470
everything that we wanted for it is that

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,979
it's the framework that built superfast

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:45,520
mobile pages there was an EMP WordPress

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,199
plugin that was maintained by Google so

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,419
that was great it promised more

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,240
conversion from mobile and it promised

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,930
also more organic traffic from more from

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,020
from Google meaning that your content if

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:04,300
it was built on EMP ranked higher in

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:08,710
search in Google there were also some

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:13,630
downsides EMP was and probably still is

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:16,030
a fairly rigid framework I needed to

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,159
build templates from scratch

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,419
imagine working with WooCommerce

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:24,099
template I needed to build a like a

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,130
template that that's matched our

00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:29,500
branding that matched our setup and

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,599
things like that it also because of its

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,620
nature it's limiting a lot of the assets

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:37,509
that you can load within WordPress you

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,669
can only have some limited external

00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,830
tracking we had for sure Analytics

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,630
Google tag manager but anything else

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,490
that was part of our tech stack didn't

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,440
couldn't fire so we needed to have a lot

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,900
of work around and then the last point

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,039
that I got for my company Google is a

00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:02,560
bad corporate machine that's for another

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:06,219
talk that I'm not gonna do a MPH tml so

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,590
the framework were works as they have

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:14,469
their own markup and their own set up

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:18,880
meaning that some HTML tags are the same

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:21,759
you're still gonna have divs headers h1

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,759
whatever but some tags are really a MP

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,659
specific so you're gonna have to learn

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:32,000
or relearn some way of doing mobile

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,130
development some tags are prohibited for

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,530
obvious reasons like object and embeds

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,070
so you need to work with components that

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,230
I'm gonna start talking about and if you

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,470
miss a required attribute you're dead

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,270
it's just breaking so if you're not

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,950
checking your work and just validate

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,210
because the validation happens

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:56,600
externally on google website so if

00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,670
something breaks you will not know about

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,670
it and it will just fail to be indexed

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,400
components components are basically a

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,310
library that Google is maintaining and

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,800
validating it works like morphus plugins

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,370
library it's works like a bit like out

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,120
of the box

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,580
JS plugins their open source

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,470
contribution are encouraged and you can

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,970
try to build your own components if you

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:30,640
can I've tried and I gave up quite fast

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,640
because it requires a lot of ramping up

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:39,710
result so this is the layout that we

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,680
have thankful you are non EMP normal

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:46,490
native responsive layout is fairly easy

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,010
so bear with AMT I just did minimum

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,410
minimal adaptation so that it looks

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:56,270
fairly the same the experience is not

00:07:51,410 --> 00:08:01,160
compromised and the result at least on

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:03,890
speed level was quite great for us going

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,460
from 11 seconds to 5 seconds load

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:15,620
average on mobile guaranteed us that we

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:18,020
lose less visitors and four results so

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,150
this is a pretty neat graph that I

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:26,180
showed you know for for my colleagues to

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:30,620
know what we could do for with one

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,530
implementation so in February 2018 we

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,580
implemented a MP and already from June

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:40,849
while we're still fixing implementing

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:44,150
SEO fixes and stuff like that we started

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,160
to see a big spike and the thing with a

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:50,450
MP and Google is that the more indexed

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,210
you get the more incremental it gets so

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,790
by september/october where I applied for

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,800
this talk we were at around 800 and by

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,640
the end of the year or yet plus two

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,920
thousand percent and for those of you

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,220
are maybe skeptical it's not like one

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,320
visit that came in two thousand visits

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,420
in January we had around a thousand

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:19,120
visitor on organic mobile and now we're

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:21,920
above 26,000 so our key learnings I'm

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,580
we're one and a half developer in

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,620
marketing so this was made by me and it

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,540
was made during one sprint for you or

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,820
working in agile and scrum and stuff

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,790
like that it represented like something

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,210
like two weeks having work workable

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:40,370
prototype we implemented only on our

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:45,260
blog because of tracking issues

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:47,570
I made one template that that got

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,850
implemented into 500 post that got

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:54,170
indexed so there was also the idea for

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:56,960
me to get this working as a template

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,530
that can be reproducible for a lot of

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,110
content we saw an uptick in 5% increase

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,470
and overall mobile traffic not only

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,140
organic but we're still working around

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:13,580
the limited tracking that EMP is

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,620
offering final thing that I wanted to

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,700
point out is that if you want to start

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:24,589
working on WordPress and ANP the new aim

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:27,680
EMP plug-in 1.0 has has been released at

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,960
least in December and haven't really

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,180
gotten with it but there's a paired mode

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:38,510
they are a mp4 Guttenberg it's quite now

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,060
on a really stable release so I'm

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,810
looking forward to see what this can

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,810
drive me to

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,550
thank you very much I felt like I sped

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,690
up I still have some time but if you

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,340
want to have question if you have

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,690
