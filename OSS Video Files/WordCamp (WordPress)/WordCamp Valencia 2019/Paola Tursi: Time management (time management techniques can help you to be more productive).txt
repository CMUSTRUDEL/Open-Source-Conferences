Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Valencia 2019
Description: 
	Do you ever have the feeling to have little time for yourself? Or that you never have the chance to do the things that you love? And what about being always late, to run all day, but never be able to complete the tasks on your to-do-list?
You’re not alone! We all went through this and certainly some time management techniques can help you to be more productive (I’ll tell you some in this talk!), but there is a secret ingredient that you have to add in your day to really lead it with satisfaction. Curious to know more about it?

will cope with that so thank you for

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,090
being here today we talked about time so

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,519
let's get it started

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,970
but first of all let me introduce myself

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm Paola the hidden one I'm Italian and

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,860
I'm a professional organizer have you

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,709
ever heard of this job someone did

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,110
someone no not at all I'm a consultant

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,910
and I help my clients to be organized

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,819
during their days to set their

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,760
priorities to get their things done so

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,160
their activities and to find an

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,310
important work-life balance which is

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,920
something that's interest the majority

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,799
of us so I am co-founder of organize the

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,650
testin we are a group of four

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,630
professional organizers and we work with

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,049
companies with freelancers we give

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:08,370
classes and we make one-to-one sessions

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:10,829
so today we will talk about time in

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,889
general so I'm sure you've heard a lot

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,459
about time management you've used these

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,650
expressions a lot of times but I'm sorry

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,200
to inform you that we cannot manage time

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,000
so you will be disappointed but the best

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,910
thing that we can do is manage ourselves

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,130
in our day why is there a need of a

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,830
professional organizer or consultant

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,830
like me for example because life got

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,349
really really complicated in the last 10

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,120
or 20 years there are so many things

00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:45,180
that we have to do so many things that

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,900
we want to do and so little time and

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,810
to accomplish them so our schedule

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,490
already start we we start our schedule

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,680
already in a hurry in the morning and

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,660
most of the times we arrive at the end

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,960
of the day that we are exhausted and we

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,190
still have a lot of things to do that we

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,370
have to postpone to the next day so we

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,310
have to fit all the pieces together and

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,980
this is why it is important like when I

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,500
said before to focus on the important

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,200
things in your day meaning in your work

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,930
but also in your personal life so this

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,660
is very important to have a good time

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:31,140
management so we talk about time but

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,560
time is limited we don't have that much

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,270
time we would like to have we have just

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,110
24 hours in the day and this is for

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,270
everyone I know we would like to have an

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,360
ocean of minutes all for ourselves but

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,050
we have just 24 hours and let's say we

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,970
have a pool of minutes and in a pool you

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,500
cannot add more water that it fits so

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,440
although we would love it

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,430
but we cannot save minutes that we did

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,460
we didn't use properly and we cannot get

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,920
get the ones that we used back so we

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,830
have to cope what we what what with what

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:16,110
we have sorry but my English sometimes

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:21,570
it's like okay so we have to party with

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:24,480
a pool I could teach you a lot of ways

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,820
to be productive and Rocio was looking

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,860
for some more productive productivity

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:34,320
tools but I'm sorry I wouldn't know we

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,960
will just talk you focus on this that

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,660
productivity is of course a solution in

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,840
our day we can learn techniques and

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,900
strategies and we can add tools in our

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,950
day to get more things done but the

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,010
point is we cannot get 36 hour days

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,860
although we are very efficient with many

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,770
tools but still we cannot stretch our

00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,680
time

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,479
so we have to deal with this and we have

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,490
to be really aware of this so what what

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,479
am I doing here I'm not talking about

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,430
time management

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,819
I'm not giving tools what am I doing

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,830
here now I want I would like to focus on

00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,960
something very important to me that I

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,060
think could be very important to you as

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:28,000
well how long does a minute last you

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,360
would say 60 seconds okay do we agree on

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,630
that

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,419
of course okay fine

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,840
this is what we know but in fact how

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:41,139
long is a minute aware of how long does

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,139
a minute last in when we are aware of

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,900
what we are doing compared to a minute

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,479
in which we are not aware of what

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,580
happens for example when we are stroked

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,220
luring scrolling our feeds like when

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,210
they told us or if we are focusing on

00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,479
something that matters to us so I would

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,940
like to make an experiment with you I

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,370
will set a time watch on one minute and

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,190
we will spend this minute just being

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,740
aware of the time passing by so you just

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,680
stay there and we will see what happens

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,030
all right okay

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,030
let me take out my phone

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,310
are you ready okay let's start

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,279
okay that fast awkward right

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:41,399
you weren't at ease probably we started

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:43,589
laughing no no no no you weren't at ease

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,329
and probably you had the impulse to take

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,820
out your phone probably to scroll down

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,550
the feet for maybe someone did it I

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,950
don't know but this is what happens all

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,630
the time we are not aware of the time

00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:00,839
passing by so if you knew a minute would

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:06,450
last so long how many things would you

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:09,240
do in a minute so today we would like to

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,570
introduce a new point of view instead of

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,790
struggling to get Han hundreds of tasks

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:20,180
done the whole day and running and

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:25,019
switching from one task very rapidly so

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:28,500
why could you just focus on the task why

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:33,959
couldn't you just dive deep in your time

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,649
and feel it and live it would that be so

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,480
difficult

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,140
maybe yes because we are not used to

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,660
that but still this is this is the thing

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,240
that we should start to learn because in

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,339
fact switching very fast from one task

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,649
to the other rarely gives us the feeling

00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,560
that we are doing well that we are doing

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:55,050
something with with real quality so this

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,470
is something that we have to learn so

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,540
the key word of today is awareness

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,779
awareness is the real way to get more

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,390
time in your day

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:09,029
could you imagine to dive deep in the

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,360
pool instead of being just on the

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:15,209
surface and moving from one task to the

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,160
other so how would that feel if you just

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:23,850
deep dive deep in your time in the tasks

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,279
you're doing at the beginning you would

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,100
see everything blurred probably and dark

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,769
you wouldn't recognize shapes but then

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,050
all of a sudden you would get accustomed

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,510
it to it and you

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,390
start seeing all the details that

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,850
earlier weren't clear so you would see

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,040
see also all the things that are

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,330
important to you and that are the real

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,330
treasure in your day

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,360
what has organization to do with this

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:58,520
organization is one of the ways I know

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,250
to raise awareness in your day because

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,740
all the time we are very we have a

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,630
crowded mind we have so many things in

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,500
mind we have so many things to do to

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:13,310
remember things to do worries or dreams

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,830
as well and they all fill our head so

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:19,070
organization is a way to clear your mind

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,440
to free it to free the energy to focus

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,330
on the things that matter to you so the

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,870
things that are important in your work

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,700
or in your life so this is something

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,340
that we have to learn because we are not

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,480
used to be aware like we saw in the

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,220
extend experiment earlier and I know

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,830
what you're thinking there are so many

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,050
things in your day that are a burden to

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,050
you that bother you that feel like a

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,160
pain in the neck something that you

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,990
don't like probably some tasks or some

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,270
activities like I don't know accounting

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,340
maybe or writing that emails to the

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,620
client who's not paying you have have

00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,850
you do you have any other examples yes

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,580
he thought about the client okay do you

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,920
have any other example of something that

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,640
bothers you but still is on your to-do

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:17,390
list I guess you have so could you

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:20,240
imagine no yes tones okay could you

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,760
imagine how would it be to get through

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,250
these things faster to focus on them and

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,380
to accomplish them can you feel how

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,390
satisfied you would be once they are

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,020
gone once you cancel them from your

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,330
to-do list it could be very very

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,420
important to you it would free a lot of

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,820
time and of energy because all the time

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,560
that you think about this this task

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,320
you're not doing you're still wasting

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,150
time and energy

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,430
so if you start doing so you will start

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,140
to develop your strength and to be

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,270
satisfied of what you're doing because

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,610
this is very important to us if you fix

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,970
if you focus on the things that bother

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,330
you and you just complete them you will

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,570
feel like power superpowers you would be

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,050
feel very satisfied so this is something

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,570
that we should learn we all should learn

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:17,540
but the problem is someone told us that

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,760
multitasking is a great skill that we

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,190
will be faster if we switch from one

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,770
task to the other and we do at the same

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:28,490
time to two or more things at the same

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:32,360
time unfortunately multitasking is a big

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:36,020
lie because you are forcing your brain

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,840
to be to do a lot more effort to switch

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:44,060
from one task to the other instead of

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:47,810
focusing on one task per time so we are

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,540
not computers we have to admit it to

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,410
ourselves first of all and start doing

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,150
one thing at a time I know this sounds

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,630
very very difficult but if you still

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:02,870
don't believe me let's play if you have

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,910
a sheet of paper and a pen just take the

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,210
mouse and we will do some exercise

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,210
together

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:37,690
okay are you ready perfect now you will

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:42,270
have to write the English alphabet in a

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,270
row in capital letters just like this

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:11,339
some doubt about the English alphabet

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:14,790
problem okay that was an easy task now

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:18,120
on the next row you have to write the

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,110
number the sequence of numbers from 1 to

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,110
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:48,420
okay easy right okay

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:51,389
now on the next row you will have to

00:16:48,420 --> 00:17:00,619
alternate letters and numbers just like

00:16:51,389 --> 00:17:00,619
this so a 1 B 2 C 3 until Z and 26

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,720
[Laughter]

00:17:48,049 --> 00:18:04,350
okay how is it going good okay okay it's

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:07,770
tiring actually done okay nice okay this

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:10,440
is an experiment of what happens when

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,510
you multitask so switching from one task

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,900
to the other meaning from the letter to

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,210
the number is a big big effort from your

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,970
to your brain because it has to

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,100
concentrate on which was the last thing

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,380
you did which is the next step you are

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,380
going to do for every sequence so every

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,360
time you switched from one to the other

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:34,140
your brain is making a big big effort

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,480
and this can bring to burn out and it

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,650
the quality of the job you're doing of

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,080
course is is poor and this was a stupid

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,900
example let's say but can you believe it

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,970
what happens when you are working and at

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,909
the same time you're just chatting on

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,950
whatsapp or when you're on the phone

00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,950
speaking to a client and at the same

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,200
time you're writing an email so which is

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,210
the result that you're not listening to

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,250
the phone and that you're writing the

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,590
email like in eighth year old kid

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,690
probably and that you will ask the

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,730
person to repeat what he or she was

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,020
saying and then if you read the email

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,429
again you have to rewrite it so

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,059
multitasking is not helping you to be

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:20,970
faster it makes you make more mistakes

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:24,270
and then it will ask you more time to

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,340
fix these mistakes and you will feel

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,460
more exhausted in your day because

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,679
because of all of this switching so it's

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,400
important to learn to focus on one thing

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,610
at a time this is my suggestion do one

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,559
thing at a time if you are on the phone

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,460
be on the phone if you're writing the

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,740
email be present on your email because

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,260
the quality of your work will increase

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,809
and the satisfaction that scan that

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,059
comes through this we increase as well

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,970
and we were talking about satisfaction

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,809
earlier so it's important to feel that

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,360
we are doing well in our

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:03,970
day and doing one thing at a time helps

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,639
us to do this and can you believe how it

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,950
feels by doing the things that you don't

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:11,649
like it's just the same beings big

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,629
satisfaction and I know that in reality

00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,309
it could be very very difficult to do

00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:18,999
one thing at a time because we are not

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:21,909
used to this this is why I suggest to

00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,399
use a timer a timer can save you it

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:27,039
means that it can help you to focus on

00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:29,169
the only activities you're doing this

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,330
means you can set the timer on ten or

00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,940
fifteen or thirty minutes depending on

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,029
how long you think your task will will

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,999
last and then focus on that activity and

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,940
only that one and by focusing I mean

00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:45,399
turning off your the programs that could

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,019
distract you and switching your phone to

00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,970
flight mode and telling the people

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,740
around you that you are very busy for

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,279
that ten or fifteen minutes

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,980
and then dive deep in this task it will

00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,889
feel very very different and I swear

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,080
that you will do all the things also in

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:06,970
less time than you thought and even

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,129
before the timer rings so we've been

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,039
talking about time management

00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:15,009
what is time management it's spending

00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:19,480
our time when and wisely and not wasting

00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:22,389
it is about getting our things done and

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,929
get them done well the ones we like as

00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:29,740
well as the ones we don't like it means

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:32,080
focusing on every activity and putting

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,200
your heart your mind and soul in

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,809
everything you do and this means raising

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,450
your awareness focusing means paying

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:42,309
attention to what you're doing to your

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,100
job to your personal life to the

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:48,309
person's you are with and this increases

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,830
your satisfaction of course and so is

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:53,559
it's only by doing all of this that you

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,570
will start realizing that you have a

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,570
treasure in your day which is your time

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,779
and you will realize as well that you

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,430
have even more time than you thought so

00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,400
this is my

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,740
a takeaway for you please do one thing

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,140
at a time and try to focus and be aware

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,750
of what you're doing your time will be

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:31,260
will explode and expand so thank you so

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:31,260
much we're on the pasamos

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:46,470
hola hello Paola thank you I used the

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,789
Pomodoro si or my work I want to know

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,549
what do you think about that if you

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:54,240
think that is useful for me it's useful

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:57,539
because I work I have a mother of 15

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,660
minutes I don't know I only want to know

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:02,910
what do you think about that Pomodoro

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,000
for who doesn't know it it's a technique

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,460
that says to set a timer on 25 minutes

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,350
and then have breaks and to focus on

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,590
that 25 minutes I think it's a good

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,299
solution if it works for you of course

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:19,409
because techniques must fit to

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:22,620
everyone's work or day and if you feel

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:25,740
like it's helping I'm sure it's a it's a

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,530
good solution some people say 25 25

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,960
minutes it's too short time to focus and

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,500
and then taking a break

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,809
is not helping them to get things done

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,630
but still the my suggestion is the same

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,700
one use the timer to focus to dive deep

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,679
in the things you're doing because this

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,380
helps you to get them done faster

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,380
so if it works for you yes absolutely

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:03,210
or Nepali seriously thank you for the

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,580
presentation I want to you say it a

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:11,790
couple of times they're getting things

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:17,820
done what do you think about the DTV I'm

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:20,580
not here this deep work on GD so I'm not

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,950
really a big big fan of the whole GD

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,950
thing but I think there are some sorry

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:29,580
what Horace GED is a getting things done

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:32,580
methods by David Allen who's really like

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,310
the productivity boss whatever it is

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,710
he's American and it's a method it's a

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:41,100
very specific one I my money to be free

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,670
of them of course it has a big problem

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,730
for me

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:48,000
because you need to feed it you need to

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:54,090
feed this method yes you waste a lot of

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,940
time just keeping all the things yes

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,250
just like for the Pomodoro Technique is

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,580
good if you feel it if you are

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:05,460
comfortable comfortable using it because

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:10,920
otherwise it feels like it's another job

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:13,770
if that it's something that is too much

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,920
and if you have this feeling that maybe

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:20,250
GTD is not the system for you but you

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,460
can take some of its suggestions

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:26,100
actually I like the brain dump part for

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,590
example so brain dump is like taking out

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,600
all the things that you have in mind and

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:35,090
writing them this is very helpful of

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,090
course but the rest with

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:47,420
yeah yeah I know it can be yes exactly

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:49,490
so maybe you can take some parts of it

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,040
the ones that use that are useful for

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,400
you sure and this is what we do actually

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,340
in our in our job to split it and to use

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,090
what is is okay for you and this is what

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,710
we do actually we just try to make the

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,750
best solution for the person actually

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,270
and not just taking a method and

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,720
applying it completely because if you

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,810
don't feel it it's doesn't work thank

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,810
you

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,910
well I was wondering if you have because

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,280
the point of the talk was to get very

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,810
focused very aware and mindful of what

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,090
you are doing in the moment you are

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,820
doing it and I was wondering if you have

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,370
ever worked with people who were like

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,370
physically unable to focus like people

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:47,390
with ADHD

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:49,610
how do you and if you like recommend

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:53,540
that then some exercises or what how did

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:59,380
you deal with them okay you know I never

00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:03,110
I never worked with hdhd persons but I

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:08,390
think some of the techniques might might

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:10,700
work for them as well for example I am

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,510
thinking of children for example that

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:17,240
cannot focus on on their tasks and maybe

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,430
help them to be focused one or two

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,350
minutes and then three until five etc

00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:25,420
this helps them to get used to some

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:31,340
methods but specifically with these

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:36,800
problems I don't I don't know question

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:40,310
me so I I know I know exactly how long a

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,350
minute is it's between 14 and 16 breaths

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:46,670
depending on how deep I breathe because

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:51,260
I do meditation I do yoga for very long

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:53,390
and so on but still I have a huge huge

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,330
problem focusing when I'm working

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,830
because I am addicted to my phone to

00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:03,470
slack to Facebook to Twitter to

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,570
Instagram it's terrible I have recently

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,980
I mean um I'm a very grown I mean I'm

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,920
nearly but I still I feel like a child

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,300
wage with with a attention deficit

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,740
problem and it's

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:21,170
induced by phones and I it's become

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:24,260
recently like a real problem for me if I

00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:26,290
have to focus also because I work for

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,840
myself I don't have a boss

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:32,410
have a team I am not accountable to

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,300
anyone but myself and it's a real issue

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,340
these days that I get to the end of the

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,640
day like what have I done

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:43,540
maybe I have got a few things finished

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,910
but really it's become a problem so this

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,580
talk is really important for me so I

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,470
guess there may I was thinking maybe the

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,860
Pomodoro Technique is something that I

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,930
should be doing but because maybe start

00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,880
with small chunks and then as you were

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,670
saying like with a child with a but

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,490
really I am cursing my phone because I

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,200
wasn't addicted and I have to admit I am

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,420
addicted to my phone

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,340
it sits in it and then if I turn the

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,610
phone off I'll still have Facebook

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,400
Twitter ins lakum on my computer and the

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,380
thing is that I think that I should just

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,420
switch off the internet just turn it off

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,850
but I can't do that because a lot of the

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:26,710
tasks that I need to accomplish actually

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:28,480
need the internet so it's it's um it's a

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,700
problem so I think that what you do is

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,400
really it's incredibly relevant these

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,710
days I guess it's not a question as in

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,820
[Music]

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:43,060
so I would say but there are also some

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,070
tools programs on the computer for

00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:50,020
example I'm can imagine of self control

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,940
you just set the in the pages that you

00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,210
don't want to see while you're working

00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:01,570
so Facebook out of it and then and you

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:02,260
make the list and then no but help

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,640
yourself

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,920
I know it's hard it's hard because we

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,850
are all updating addicted actually so

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:17,269
it's like

00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:20,299
I have an app like that because I know

00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:25,429
the problem and it's called freedom and

00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:29,389
it is once it's in working you can't

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:31,639
turn it off you can't turn it off and

00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:34,730
it's horrible it is actually horrible

00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:36,679
because I have my freedom app on for

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,630
social media between 10:00 at night and

00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,630
10:00 in the morning because I want to

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,029
get because my loss of time was before I

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,860
went to bed I was endlessly scope

00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:48,409
scrolling through the Instagram and

00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,830
Facebook and whatever and when I got up

00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:55,100
it was the first thing I did so I I

00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:58,730
eliminate I eliminated those and it is

00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,450
like so refreshing so it's amazing but I

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,220
curse the app millions of times already

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,730
so it is but it's working because you

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:11,450
can't turn it off and I think also I

00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:14,029
hope three done what I was thinking as

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,730
well as then my excuse is that some of

00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:19,039
the people I work with communicate with

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,360
me by a messenger it's just because

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,860
we're used to it with friends on

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,960
Facebook and they write to me in

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,580
messenger so I guess that this story is

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,559
that you just have to tell everybody's

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:32,090
like if you want to speak to me you need

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:35,330
to email me and then we make what's I

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:39,559
don't know promise on you yeah I know

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,389
but I feel I know but I get anxious

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:51,620
because I think maybe someone's written

00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:54,529
to be any and I'm gonna die okay after

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,590
my rant does is there are there any more

00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,590
questions

00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:12,900
we'll how do you do it with not

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,900
work-related tasks because I am pretty

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:19,170
good at doing focused work yes when it's

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:24,800
work but then I go cooking and cleaning

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:27,960
and ironing and walking the dog and I

00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:32,640
write like that okay so how do you do

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,130
how do you do you also use you can use

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,020
it if you're cleaning and you don't like

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,510
cleaning you just set the timer 15

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,880
minutes very concentrated and then you

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,870
just can app you give it a break and

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,870
then you do something else

00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:05,240
hello hello there sorry and so thank you

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,660
for the presentation very interesting my

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,340
question is when we are a lot here

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,250
entrepreneurs and when you're

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:17,870
entrepreneur sometimes you have to be

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:22,670
multitasking because in my case at least

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:25,640
I receive calls and then that call

00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:29,180
brings - one thing that I have to answer

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,010
and do right away or I was doing

00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,550
something else and then something else

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:39,110
happened and it's very difficult to just

00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:42,350
say no I I cannot put my phone I can't

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:46,130
not put my phone into airplane mode it's

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:48,260
impossible because in my case if I miss

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:54,350
that call that means one sale that it's

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:56,060
gone so in in this case I I cannot say I

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,450
have developed multitasking because

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:03,200
that's not true but I have learned more

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:07,070
or less to do tasks kind of at the same

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,200
time I won't say I'm very successful at

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,030
it but it has to be done like this at

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040
least for the moment because I am alone

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,380
doing my own stuff maybe when I have

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,510
something else or somebody else working

00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,580
with me that could be different but for

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,310
this before the moment sometimes you

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,899
have at least in my case I have to do it

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,200
like this and I was talking to my

00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:30,980
colleague here and we're less where I

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,480
have the same issue so but I guess I'm

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,510
not we're not the only one probably

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,940
doing that so how do you deal with these

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,300
cases what did you recommendation to

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,270
that

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,360
well I start of understanding if you're

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,610
working in a hospital or in emergency

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,730
room so this is what this is not the

00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:53,390
case of course so we are like we can

00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:56,179
take a breath okay so it's okay - we

00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:58,490
have a lot of things done but it's not

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:01,130
that you have to save lives and you have

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:04,580
to do right everything at the same time

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,320
so this means probably we can just focus

00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,480
on one thing maybe you have you are on

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,900
the phone just be on the phone and then

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,339
you

00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,950
take a note on what you have to do next

00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:15,710
but just it's it's a sequence of what

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,510
you have to do it's not you're not doing

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,069
a good job actually if you're not

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,319
focused on what you're doing because

00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:24,380
you're thinking of too many things all

00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:27,049
together so this is this is the point

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,270
it's just being aware that you have to

00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:32,420
do it in sequence it's not possible to

00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:34,609
do a good job and to be focused and to

00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,260
be satisfied of what you're doing if you

00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,569
just run from one thing to the other

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,200
it's just like being on the surface all

00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:44,299
the time and you're not really getting

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,039
what you're doing but I understand there

00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:48,440
are so many people that told tell us

00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,450
that no I cannot switch my emails off

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,430
that we have to be on the phone all the

00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,650
time and that I think I communicate with

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,720
my clients like this it's all true we

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,940
all do it all the time but we're not

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,200
saving lives for my case I'm not saving

00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:07,160
life in that moment so I have to make

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,140
choices and stay focused on the one the

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,319
one thing that I'm doing at that moment

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:16,279
and then I go on in setting priorities

00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:18,140
as well and then making a list actually

00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:21,579
of what you have to do in sequence

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,960
because okay you are able now to

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,299
multitask or to switch very fast from

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,869
one task to the other but you feel

00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:31,130
exhausted probably not happy either so I

00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,020
think that they're not they were not

00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:35,539
saving lives I mean I'd seen this to

00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,099
myself as well but they were not saving

00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:37,460
lives I think that's the most important

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,279
thing

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:45,829
now it's yeah if they in five minutes

00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:49,160
there's the wrong table in in track 1

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:52,599
and I cannot thank paola enough for the

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,599
wonderful wonderful talk

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,000
