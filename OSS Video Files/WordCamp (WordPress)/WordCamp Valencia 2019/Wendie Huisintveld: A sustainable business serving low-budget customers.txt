Title: Wendie Huisintveld: A sustainable business serving low-budget customers
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Valencia 2019
Description: 
	I started my business to make money doing what I love.  For a long time, these 2 were mutually exclusive. I love working with small businesses but they are almost always on a small budget. In 2017 I redesigned my business to serve my favorite types of customers and make money in a sustainable way. You will get a close look into my business process, the tools I use, my workflow and my communication tactics to actually help my clients and sustain and grow my business.

hello live stream and today I okay

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,760
everybody is clear in this room that my

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,500
talk is gonna be in English right

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,140
right you all understand English okay so

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,330
my talk today is going to be how to

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,200
build a sustainable business serving low

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,709
budget customers and before I start

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,520
talking about this I want to tell you

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,380
what the buildup of my talk is these are

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,660
the things I'm gonna work through and

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,060
that should be 30 minutes and by the end

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,180
of it you should know what I did and

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,760
hopefully you'll be inspired to use some

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,130
of the tools and the tactics I used to

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,200
using your own business so before I

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,840
start how many of you are actually

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,080
business owners oh that is so many good

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,810
good good and how many of you have

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,860
clients that tell you they don't have

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:10,140
any money for a website right so the

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:14,580
problem is quite relatable right so

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,459
before I start my story I want to ask

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,099
you to take a minute and ask yourself

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,310
why am I here

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:29,299
because the question serving low budget

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:32,430
customers might be something that can

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:36,090
have give you a bad taste in your mouth

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,879
because it might you might think that

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,250
you want to get people to give you money

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,650
that they don't have so I wrote a

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,669
disclaimer before I start to tell you

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,969
that this is not about that I am NOT

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:53,669
gonna tell you how to get people to give

00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:58,889
you money they don't have because that

00:03:53,669 --> 00:04:02,669
is not okay okay this is not about a get

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,760
rich scheme about people falling for a

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:08,250
beautiful talks you tell them they give

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,879
you money and they end up with nothing

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,040
this is not about that and also this is

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,139
not the answer to all the questions you

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,970
might have about why you don't have any

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,829
money okay

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,049
if you were expecting to get one of

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:30,990
these questions answered this is the

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:33,419
moment to go away nobody cool okay so

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,250
this is me I am the owner of two

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,349
companies I come from the Netherlands

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:42,570

the Netherlands and in wordcamp europe

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,030
I've been an organizer I've been a

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,430
volunteer I've been an MC haven't been a

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,500
speaker yet if anybody from the war camp

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,130
Europe team is listening I would love to

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,520
be a speaker and I am the proud owner of

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:03,070
a small dog which is taking over my

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,780
house okay so this is about me and I

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,760
want to tell you about the journey I had

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,720
with my website club company because

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,060
that is what this story is about I

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,100
started out in 2010 I got fired I had a

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,220
job I was a project manager at the

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,830
library in my town and I got fired

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,260
because the budget of the library got

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:28,190
cut so they didn't have any money for me

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,349
left I started working on for myself as

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,110
a freelancer I thought I was gonna be a

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:35,030
project project manager but apparently

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,520
there are like a gazillion project

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,710
managers in the Netherlands so nobody

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,380
was actually waiting for me and nobody

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,630
really wanted me so I had no work and

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,660
people are asking me about my experience

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,990
with the internet and building websites

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,060
because that's what I did for fun so I

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,990
started building websites for people and

00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:01,030
that went quite nice actually the first

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:04,669
website i built i charged 320 euros

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,940
which i thought was like an amazing big

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:10,760
chunk of money but i worked on it for

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,550
about 3 of to 4 weeks

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,940
i did nothing else so at the end of the

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,719
month i had 320 euros to pay all my

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,869
bills

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:24,839
I don't know how the rates are in Spain

00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:27,209
but with 320 euros I can't pay my rent

00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,979
and my electrics and my internet and

00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:32,189
have food on the table it's just not

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:34,349
doable so I started my company I started

00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,179
working and I thought okay I don't have

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,309
him enough money I need to work more

00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:42,809
work work work more and more and more

00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:45,899
more customers and because I was working

00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:47,699
with people that needed my help

00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,989
I thought they needed my help they told

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,029
me they needed my help

00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:53,369
but they didn't have any money I was

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:57,029
really kind of scared to charge a lot

00:07:53,369 --> 00:08:00,959
and it ended up with me being bankrupt

00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:03,599
almost burnout with no money and the kid

00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,289
and a lot of customers who were paying

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,259
me a little money so I thought about it

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:12,659
and I thought okay so people tell told

00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,939
me I need to work on bigger projects

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:17,369
because bigger projects have bigger

00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,519
budgets you'll be part of a team you'll

00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:22,110
be working in a marketing team you'll be

00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,739
working with a content creator and a

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,419
photographer and SEO person and so we

00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:30,239
did that and it worked

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,610
I earned more money the projects were

00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:34,909
bigger I had to work well a little less

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,579
but I earned more money I made a living

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,939
but I was so unhappy I hated working in

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:45,089
a team I really really hated it so that

00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:48,089
was not the answer for me so I decided I

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,459
need to change this I need to find a way

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,050
where I can do what I want and make

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,050
money and pay my bills

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,709
um well

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,700
I am not really a team player I know

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:09,350
it's really not cool but I really like

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,000
doing my own thing and when you're in a

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,720
team you can't do that

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,720
so I kind of clashed with the teams

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,319
maybe I will maybe you're right but it's

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,119
a good thing to consider but I did

00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,509
something else and I will share that

00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:33,670
with you okay so it ended up for me

00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:35,829
coming to the conclusion that helping

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,769
the people I liked and making money were

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,689
like it's one or the other I could be

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,329
helping people or I could be making the

00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:46,329
money but I can't both at the same time

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,309
and that in my brain made like a

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:51,759
disconnection because I thought this

00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:55,869
should not be this is not right it

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:59,829
should be possible to do both so what

00:09:55,869 --> 00:10:05,110
did I do - so what I did to figure it

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:07,360
out I started doing a course I enrolled

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,929
in WP elevation has anybody ever heard

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,149
of WP elevation yeah

00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,709
it's a course and they teach you to

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,959
improve your workflow and business

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,970
practices it's specifically for people

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,949
that work in the WordPress business and

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,079
they have a blueprint and it's six weeks

00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:25,089
and in six weeks you will learn all

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,749
kinds of processes and all kinds of

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:30,459
tools you can use to get your clients

00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:33,369
through your business quit more quickly

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:36,519
and to have a better workflow basically

00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:39,069
that's what they did and I also enrolled

00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:43,119
at the same time in fizzle has anybody

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:46,089
ever heard of fizzle fizzle is a small

00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:49,029
American company WP elevation is

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,739
Australian so fizzle is a small well

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:54,669
it's not small anymore but it's American

00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:57,220
company and they say they they offer

00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:59,290
courses and it's evergreen so you can do

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,179
whatever cost of course you want at any

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:07,899
time something that you care about so

00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:09,819
this really this tagline really spoke to

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,319
me because that is what I wanted I

00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,899
wanted to earn a living doing something

00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:15,880
that I care about if you're interested

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,399
fizzle has a

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,300
amazing free podcast you can listen to

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,310
they have like more than 300 episodes so

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,880
you can just get a taste of what they

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,490
offer and what I worked out between the

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,160
two courses is that there are there are

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,399
three questions I need to answer to get

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,940
this problem solved I need to know what

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,800
do I do what I do how much money do I

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,230
actually need because I was just

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,019
guessing and I was figuring at the base

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,959
what the pill the bills were not paid I

00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:52,750
wasn't earning enough but I didn't

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,240
really know how much I actually needed

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:59,670
so that was the thing and the last thing

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,670
was how do I bring these two together so

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,339
why do I do what I do has any of you

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,000
ever asked yourself that question

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,209
especially the entrepreneurs why do you

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,949
do what you do it's one of the most

00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,720
important questions and if you have it

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,940
answered and if you have it answered

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,670
correctly

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,670
it helps you make choices so much easier

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,740
because you can always check with

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:32,130
yourself whenever something comes up is

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:35,170
this helping my why so for me it was

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,149
very difficult because I was like yeah I

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,819
want to make a living and I want to

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,829
support my family I want to take a trip

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:44,889
every now and then and I want to help

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:47,410
people people I like and I want to make

00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,290
websites because it's kind of fun so I

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,110
kind of got stuck and then I found marie

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,519
forleo's marietv i don't know if you

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,730
have heard of it but if you haven't

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,170
check it because it's very inspiring

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,430
marietv and she said if you don't know

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,279
what you want if you don't know what

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,889
your passion is do this exercise and it

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,720
was this exercise wouldn't it be cool if

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,139
and then answer it

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,839
and then three times answer why is that

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,889
important to me and you do this seven

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,980
days in a row for 15 minutes just keep

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,899
writing keep writing so I did that

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,240
because I wanted the answer and I was

00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:29,209
desperate for money and answers then I

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,430
the other thing was I could get a job

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,889
but I actually didn't want that as well

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,459
so I did this and for me this was the

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:39,379
outcome the things that are most

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,009
important to me I want to take care of

00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,949
my family

00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,829
I'm a single mother I am like the only

00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:48,290
one bringing in money so that was my

00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:50,389
first priority I want to make enough

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,730
money so that the bills are paid and we

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:55,480
me and my daughter don't have to go and

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,480
live in a box

00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,360
if I can make my business any way I want

00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,770
I worked I want to work with people that

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,060
need my help and that I like because

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,260
there are a lot of people that need my

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,790
help and there are other people I don't

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,740
like but if I get to choose I want to

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,500
work with people that I do like and

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,260
people that need help because if they

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,230
don't want my help I am like totally

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,390
useless and my energy is totally wasted

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,340
I want to have a healthy work-life

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,880
balance because I got totally off track

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:35,380
with doing only work and I want to live

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,600
playfully to get this going in my life I

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,810
started with the last I started playing

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,740
I took a golf course just because I

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,390
wanted to do something that was fun to

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,000
me just something totally useless

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,330
because my life had been a struggle for

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,610
so many years and I was so tired and I

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:58,270
just wanted to have some fun

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,680
so my advice to you is whenever you feel

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,800
like you're struggling which

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,380
entrepreneurs single preneur I know you

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,270
are life can be hard when you are

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,150
responsible when you are solely

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,970
responsible for bringing in the income

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:16,060
find something that is just for fun

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,180
because it helps it makes it all the

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,520
rest it makes it easier so I started

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,500
there and I started playing golf and I

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,300
didn't think I would like it but I loved

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,920
it I still do it and then I started

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,500
looking at my work-life balance so how

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,440
many of you have ever written down how

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,440
they spend their time like in a normal

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,740
day

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,990
a couple of hands you should try it and

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,500
then try like three or five days in a

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,980
row

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,459
you'd be surprised because I thought I

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:56,180
spent most of my time working well in

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:59,329
fact I did but I also spent like three

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,569
to five hours a day just randomly

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:06,139
scrolling social media which is not

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:09,740
helpful if you feel pressured already so

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,480
I did two things I decided okay what are

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,879
the things I want to I want to spend my

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,220
time on and what are the things that I'm

00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,860
spending my time on that I don't want to

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,720
spend my time on so the things I want to

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,110
do is again spend time with my family

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,129
have some fun do some work be with

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:32,420
friends and also do some caregiving jobs

00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:35,420
that needs to be done so it I took a

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,449
good look I just I just the tools I use

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,110
are pens and papers and lists I just

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,870
created lists

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:47,080
and then I wanted to support my family

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,910
so I had to calculate what do I need to

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,990
support my family it's a number it's

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,750
just a set number and needle was talking

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,310
about minimal Viable Product people who

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,730
were here in the previous talk

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,480
well the minimal valuable income is like

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:08,470
that except it's about the money that

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,100
yet that goes to you so how much do you

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,310
need

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,390
what minimum do you need to just get

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:18,940
through the month and it's really easy

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,000
calculation it's just how much expenses

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,880
do you have it's really simple it's rent

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,720
it's electric it's water it's gas it's

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,540
the Internet it's the phone it's

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:36,100
whatever you whatever things you have to

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,990
pay every month and food because I

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,480
calculated and I was like this is a

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,950
really low number and then I thought I

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,720
need to eat as well so you have your

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,760
minimal valuable income which is the

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,940
amount you need to pay yourself to pay

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,890
your bills and and eat and you add that

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,680
you add your business expenses to it and

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,230
the Texas you need to pay for the first

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,410
few years I forgot to pay my taxes which

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,990
was very expensive in the years after

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,930
that because the Texas will come and get

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,020
you so calculate them in as well and

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,560
then you get a number I chose a random

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:17,380
number and that is what you have to

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,370
bring in a month and when I looked at my

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,050
number which is my random number when I

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,500
looked at my number I was like three

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,110
thousand euros a month how am I gonna do

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,110
that because I wasn't I didn't know how

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,350
to price my products I was just doing

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:39,850
something but I just I guess it and

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:42,460
that's what I did so to get it to make

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:46,779
it easier for myself I broke

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:50,710
into little bits if I want to make 3000

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:53,320
euros a month and I have there these

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,230
numbers like 160 working hours a month

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,539
and 50% billable hours those are just

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,019
known facts I got them off the internet

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:05,110
and with my registration it seems that

00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:08,080
it's quite correct in some weeks and

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:13,840
some weeks it's not but average it's

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,240
quite okay so if I need to make if I

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,450
need to make 3000 euros and I have 80

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,940
hours per month I need to make at least

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:28,600
30 750 per hour and $3,000 euros was

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:33,249
like a huge amount for me but 3750 was

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:36,879
like I can do that I can make that the

00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:39,429
same with the other two numbers so it

00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:43,179
made it for me it made it much easier to

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:47,280
grasp the numbers and to think I can do

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:50,910
this I can get this money

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,370
all right so the last thing I wanted to

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,950
do is I want to work with people I like

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:59,700
so I call them lovely customers in my

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,830
story it's a her because I ended up

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,770
working mostly with women it doesn't

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,560
mean that it has to be a lady but in my

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:14,010
story it is so my lovely customers I

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:16,770
need it I want with people I like so to

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,890
get to that point I needed to find out

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:24,420
what kind of people do I like so what I

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:28,350
did I looked at stories I've already had

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:30,660
and picked the ones I liked most the

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,520
ones that were never a burden the ones

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,830
that when they called I actually picked

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,650
up the phone and was not like oh my god

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,780
you again no I'm not here and the ones

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,040
that that listened to me and did what I

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,330
told them to so I checked those and

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,050
there were some things they had in

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,660
common they were single preneur so they

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:56,070
worked alone they rented themselves by

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:59,010
the hour to companies they were hands-on

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,860
people so they weren't really like yeah

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,200
the website yeah yeah you do it or we

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,350
need some graphic yeah yeah you do it

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,880
they wanted to get in the dirt and

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,660
wanted to do it themselves

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,370
and they were creative people and I put

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,980
the bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,520
because in the end after making my list

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,920
I was like this is not what it's about

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,360
this is not these are easy things to

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,560
check but this is not what it's about

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,370
and it came down for me to this my

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,700
lovely customer is somebody I would

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:39,270
invite into my home when they show up

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,790
unannounced and that became my single

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:45,580
criteria

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:48,190
everybody who calls me and says I want

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,440
to be your customer and I'm like yeah

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,980
you are never coming to my house because

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:59,170
I'm not even giving you my address I

00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:01,930
send them to someone else so this is

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,450
quite important to me and it is a very

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,460
strong and very easy check because I can

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,340
feel this in my belly when I meet you I

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,530
know if you are one of them or not it

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,450
doesn't mean I'm not gonna like you or

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:18,220
I'm not gonna be nice to you I will

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:20,950
but this check I will know so for me

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,530
this was like it all came down all the

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,990
other things well you can check them if

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,900
all the other things are true but for me

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:32,610
for my business for my customers this

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:36,940
was the check are you still with me

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:39,700
cool okay so doing all this

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,510
investigation still only using paper and

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,400
pens and lists what kind of help can I

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,910
offer my lovely customer who is allowed

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:53,020
in my home anytime they ring my bell so

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:56,380
that so they can pay me a part of my

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,690
3,000 euros or maybe a big part but

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,790
assuming that the people that come to me

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,500
tell me they have no budgets or no

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:08,080
budgets I assume it's a part of the

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,850
three thousand years so that was my

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:17,549
question I was going to work with

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:20,700
okay new investigation to get to the

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:22,409
answer of this I had four i i listed

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,039
four questions that i needed to answer

00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:28,020
to get to the point what does my lovely

00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,830
customer think she needs what does she

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,530
actually need how can i align these two

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:39,240
so that it is helpful and affordable for

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:42,390
her and profitable for me because my

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,480
lovely customer if she says she has no

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,640
money she is not a customer remember

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,220
this if someone comes to you and says

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,770
they have no money you say thank you

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,470
very much for thinking of me come back

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,770
when you have some money it doesn't have

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,330
to be much but there has to be money

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,690
people that don't pay you are your cust

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:08,370
on your customers they are your charity

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,190
okay remember that so what can I do to

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,059
be helpful and affordable to her and

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,520
profitable to me and I added the last

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,230
question I added later because I thought

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,220
yeah I've been doing this work for like

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,650
five years

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:28,770
it is like insane to find total new ways

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,150
because I have been paying the bills not

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,480
all of them on time

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,490
but I have been paying them and I am

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,850
already doing something right so I

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,610
decided to investigate that as well so I

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,220
started what do I already do because I

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,789
did help people they I did send them an

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,549
invoice they did pay me and that was

00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:52,650
basically the easy part

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:56,190
except for my business process was like

00:24:52,650 --> 00:25:00,059
a big blurry like a big mess of all

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,850
kinds of things I kind of did and things

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,940
they were kind of

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,400
I could ask me and things I could kind

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:13,480
of answer so I had to figure out what

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:17,060
steps are specifically in my business I

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,330
back to that later how I how I broke it

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,700
down so what is my lovely customer think

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,190
she needs because the I noticed that

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,980
what someone needs and what someone

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,710
thinks they need are like two totally

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,200
different things I don't know if it how

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,380
it how it is with you but with me people

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,700
call me and they say hello Wendy I need

00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:45,290
a website can you help me and I need a

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,230
website is like such a big thing that I

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,330
often think that's not exactly what you

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,980
need and that is not like the question

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,900
that you have for me there were like a

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,570
couple of questions before that and

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,900
there questions after that I need a

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,900
website is the big question that just

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,370
containers all of them but that is not I

00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,880
could give them a website and they

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,100
wouldn't be helped right so she thinks

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,130
she needs a website but what she

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:19,070
actually need I figured it out is

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:22,970
superwoman or me with a lot of wind what

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,730
she needs is someone to break down the

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,500
website process someone to put it into

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,510
little steps someone to hold her

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,070
accountable because it's a hand one

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,600
person she wants to write to content

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,190
herself she wants to take the photos

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,340
herself she wants to pick the images

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,610
herself but if there's no one telling

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,520
her you need to have it done by the

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:46,670
first of next month it is not getting

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,740
done so she needs someone to break down

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,900
the steps what it takes to create a

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,440
website and she needs someone to be

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,960
accountable to and I decided that was

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,740
gonna be me

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:05,830
so I broke it down break it down is my

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:10,619
new thing the services I offer it was a

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:14,549
big big pile of blurry mud whatever and

00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:17,350
I broke it down to these five things

00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,990
when you create a website for a customer

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,909
who is new to being an entrepreneur and

00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,990
who doesn't have much money there are a

00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,960
few steps they need to take

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,240
they need to find out who they are what

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,730
their product is and what their ideal

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,850
customer is and then you can create

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,220
content based on that they need a design

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,960
you need to educate them on how to use

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,289
their website because the website is

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,869
worthless if you're not using it and

00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:47,139
there needs to be some maintenance done

00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:49,779
somewhere in the process so these are

00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:51,399
the services I offer which also for

00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:52,600
myself made it clear because once

00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,999
someone asked you could you help me with

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,299
social media I'm like is that within

00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:59,860
that list no it's not I'm sorry I can

00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:04,690
send you to someone else who can help

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:07,539
you but that is not what I do okay and I

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,119
decided having made all my lists there

00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:13,899
are four areas where I could win where I

00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:18,070
could really make big step forward in

00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:21,429
not having so much fuss and those were

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,590
standardized automate outsource and

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,950
healthy boundaries I will go through

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:30,629
them step-by-step so standardize who

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:36,190
here works with standardized things

00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:40,279
standardized emails forums checklists

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:43,879
this is a game changer this really is

00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,610
all not all but most of my emails and

00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:49,669
most of the things I have in my company

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:52,369
are standardized which means I never

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:55,970
have to think about things that need to

00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:58,580
be done because it's just a list when

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,279
someone calls me I hello Andy

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,350
I would like a website I send them a

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,179
standardized email hey we had a phone

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,860
call and you want a website here are the

00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:10,759
things you need to do before we get

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,379
together first checklist I have some

00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:16,549
questions about what your website needs

00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:18,289
to be about form when they send it back

00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:21,710
to me which is a check I mean I don't

00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:23,960
have to worry about the customer calling

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,799
them or if they don't send back the

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,590
things it's not my customer so forms and

00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,759
checklists and standardized emails are

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:37,519
like magic power because first of all

00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,490
you get done with things so much faster

00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,659
you don't have to think about it you can

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,509
write them in your own tone of voice

00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:48,679
whatever you like I always put something

00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:51,320
funny twisty smiley thingy in it and it

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,059
is already it's done so you change the

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,789
name and you fill in and you send them

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:58,820
the forms and they can get to work and

00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:02,029
the thing is people really feel helped

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,950
if you send them a checklist they really

00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:06,019
feel helped because now they know

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,990
instead of thinking I need a website

00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:12,740
were on earth am I gonna start they know

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,990
okay so I need to create content for the

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,769
homepage which is gonna be the answer to

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,529
the question

00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:21,610
I am bla bla bla bla bla and I help bla

00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,770
bla bla bla bla with bla bla bla bla bla

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,320
you have that you filled it filled in

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,630
the sentence check okay next on the home

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,630
page there is gonna be I it's just a

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:36,370
checklist so I created PDFs

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:40,570
in Word and that is it these are mine

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:43,690
still old styling but I still use them

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:47,260
so this is the standard checklist for a

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:50,830
page I wrote down when you create a page

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:53,140
this has got to be in it you have to use

00:30:50,830 --> 00:31:00,820
at least 300 words make paragraphs of

00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:03,370
maximum 100 words so I have the same

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,250
thing for product pages and I have the

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,050
same thing for the about me page I have

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,970
the same thing for images I have the

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,980
same thing for blog posts I have it for

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,200
everything

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,830
so standardized it's a real it's also a

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,830
time-saver

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:23,470
automate was my next step I have 10 more

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,350
minutes I'm gonna speed it up a little

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,330
automate what's my next step I think we

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,640
all know what automate is I created a

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,410
standard WordPress installation with all

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,320
the plugins I wanted all the themes I

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,800
wanted and I found a hosting company

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,420
that I can easily duplicate so it's just

00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,440
whenever someone says I need a website I

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:46,110
press one button and it's there I did

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,770
the same thing with my bookkeeping and

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:52,810
maintenance an outsource I put it in I

00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:56,350
didn't put it in at first but I put it

00:31:52,810 --> 00:32:00,070
in because it is really something that

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:02,850
makes you win a lot of time and win a

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:05,640
lot of brain space

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,870
and this is I think this is the most

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,700
important one it's the healthy

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:13,290
boundaries because whatever a customer

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,600
came to me and they were like yeah we

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,880
need to talk and I and I would talk with

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,070
them and we would talk about the website

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,570
and I was like okay they're gonna be

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,730
here an hour and they stayed for two

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,340
three four hours and then the work

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,050
wasn't done and I thought well the work

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,460
is not finished I should finish it for

00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:36,060
them so I quit everything people pay for

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,160
all my time so I limited the most

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:42,870
important thing is I limited access to

00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,250
me you can hire me but then for every

00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:48,600
minute you spend with me

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,000
you pay me that is like super clear if

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,790
you want to call me it's fine

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,820
you pay me and we make an appointment I

00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:00,800
decide when we get to call not you so I

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:04,290
stopped answering my phone and I stopped

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,450
giving my time away and I stopped giving

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:12,680
my knowledge away except from the

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:15,300
standardized forms and systems and I

00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,760
healthy boundaries basically that was

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:21,390
what for me one of the most important

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,200
things so I freed up a lot of time from

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,730
not saying yes to odd I have a really

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,410
quick question can you help me with this

00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,840
oh I have something that needs to be

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,300
changed can you help me with this and

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,310
the answer is always no I can't I can

00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,050
help you but I can help you then and

00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:41,970
then and it's just you're gonna cost you

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:47,960
so much so it ended up with my services

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:52,050
I created that most of it is

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:56,330
standardized outsourced or automated

00:33:52,050 --> 00:34:02,460
and the things that I am involved in are

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:05,310
strictly bounded so it changed my system

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,650
a little bit because I thought that the

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,690
discovery phase where people find out

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,909
what what they want to offer and what

00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,260
the product is and what they're about

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,470
could be totally standardized and

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,510
optimized but it didn't work so I put in

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,760
a discovery session where they spent

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,890
time with me and we do it together we

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,140
fill out the forms together and it

00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:28,500
creates a lot of clarity and they pay me

00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,659
for it what I also did because I mean

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,640
how much is a website I don't know what

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,409
you charge but I used to charge around a

00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,970
thousand fifteen hundred euros which was

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:42,210
for many people way too much I cut it up

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:44,360
in pieces so the total charge is fifteen

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,280
hundred euros if you buy this package

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,070
but you pay it in pieces a discovery

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,149
session as two hundred sixty euros

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,700
content creation you can do it by

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:56,190
yourself so you get for free design is

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:59,310
like five or six hundred euros so and

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,340
you decide as a customer you decide when

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:05,430
you want to spend the money so you don't

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,410
have to buy this all at once you can do

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,960
a discovery session create your content

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,570
by yourself get a website that is not

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,550
designed but WordPress websites look

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:19,200
quite fine without explicit design and

00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,450
go and work a year make some money and

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,520
then get a designer and have your

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:29,300
website design so

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,480
I created small blocks small packages

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:36,740
and together instead of offering one big

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,290
thing I offer small services and the the

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,270
extra bonus of that is that people can

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,250
take as long as they want for creating

00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,980
that content because I'm not waiting

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,380
they pay their discovery I really don't

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,140
care if they take a week for creating

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:55,480
that contact or a year because I can

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,480
plan my own time with other customers

00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:02,240
okay so I created this list and I tried

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,890
it and it worked and like I told you

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,180
with the discovery

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:12,500
not everything word so I adjusted it and

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:14,869
I'm still adjusting it but for now I am

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,770
easily making my minimal viable income

00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:22,510
easily serving customers that are paying

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:26,450
me like between 200 and 500 euros per

00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:28,250
per time they are happy I am happy

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,440
because I get to help quite a lot of

00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:34,450
people you do need to have a big chunk

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:38,630
of people to make a living in low budget

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:41,390
customer land but the things I learned

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:45,770
are and I want to share them with you

00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:48,050
random order kind of not really money

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,460
isn't everything but worries about it

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,490
will take over your life if you don't

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,400
have any that goes for me but that also

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,980
goes for my customer because if they

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,920
need to spend 1500 euros on a website

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,890
they don't have that is not a relaxed

00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,140
place to be in the same goes for me if I

00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,600
don't have any money then every customer

00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,000
who might be interested I am gonna go

00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,480
after them like a crocodile smelling am

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,369
a piece of chicken and that is not a

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,470
healthy relationship that is not healthy

00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,420
so money isn't everything but worries

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:25,020
about it will take over your life if you

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:29,670
don't have any so make sure you take

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:32,400
care of yourself first that means you

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:37,410
need to get a job to get your business

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,540
going do that because it is been tested

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,390
again and again it's been social studies

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,930
about it when you live in poverty your

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:48,000
brain does not work you can't think

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,700
about the future you can't think about

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,099
things you want to do you want to grow

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,630
you your brain works differently when

00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,440
you live in poverty when you have money

00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:01,170
worries so take care of yourself first

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,200
money I also noticed money is never the

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:07,140
problem it is like a big chunk of money

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,030
or it is that people don't know what

00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,849
they're spending the money on or people

00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:15,170
don't want to give you the money but

00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:18,060
money is actually never the real problem

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,339
the same with me I thought my problem

00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,859
was my customers weren't paying me

00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:24,720
enough but that really wasn't the

00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,450
problem the problem was that the systems

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,310
I had and the way I worked was not

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:33,810
serving them in a way that was

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:37,859
profitable for me so money is never the

00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:40,859
actual problem again reminder if someone

00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:46,500
says they have no money they are not a

00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:49,680
customer okay okay so I did two courses

00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,430
which helped me is very very much WP

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,700
elevation and fizzle find information

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,190
online there is so much to you can find

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,109
so much and you can take it and tweak it

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,420
and make it your own and you can learn

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:07,260
from it so you don't have to invent the

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,089
view just try whatever is out there see

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,780
if it works for you and if it doesn't

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,780
try something else

00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:17,900
because all systems work it really does

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:23,480
they all work you just have to find the

00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:26,630
right one for you so these are my

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,940
takeaways all systems work learn from

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,180
others money is never ever the problem

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,470
take care of yourself first money is

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,150
never the problem and it isn't

00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:40,060
everything you answer to everything but

00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,060
worries about it will screw you

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,860
[Applause]

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,860

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:27,500
checklist the Yost's Yoast SEO plug-in

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,630
you know you when you have the plug-in

00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,190
installed in your WordPress they have

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,060
like this checks do you have an image

00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:37,640
does it have an alt text do you have

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,680
it's basically that and then I redesign

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,260
it a little and put my words in it and

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,720
it's in Dutch and then I'm like here you

00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:51,640
have a checklist made it for you so you

00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,640
can you can see it in the Yoast plugin

00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:02,600
anybody else know in the back

00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,640
I have a history of having traveled so

00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:19,190
you know to clients often because they

00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:23,480
get offended and everything so I wanted

00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:26,000
to know when you talked about what kind

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,770
of clients you didn't like you told you

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,099
send them away to another person but how

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:36,859
do you deal with rejecting a client what

00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:42,680
kind of creates three years so they

00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:45,170
don't get offended or right right so

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,960
there are two answers to this question

00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,710
first of all I trained myself and being

00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,130
offensive that is like a really really

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,930
healthy and good skill to have no

00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,180
seriously you're laughing about it it is

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:04,609
really really important to be able to

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:08,480
say no don't explain it don't excuse

00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:13,069
yourself just say no and you can

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,810
practice it with like like you can

00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:16,640
practice it with with things that are

00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,920
not very important like when someone

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,280
asks you in on the street do you have

00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,740
any money no don't excuse it don't sorry

00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:28,670
no I don't have any cash on me well yeah

00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:31,310
no just say no so practice being

00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,990
offensive and saying no that is

00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,599
important

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:40,069
and the second thing is I always give

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,839
them a little thing to get them I am NOT

00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:44,329
saying no I can help you and what you

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,210
are asking is stupid and I'm saying okay

00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:49,460
I am not the right person for you but

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,619
you can go and ask this person or maybe

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:55,670
you can try the forums or you can try

00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:58,270
this or I always have something to help

00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,270
them move forward

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:06,019
sorry alternative for what they are

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,930
asking of me but the most important

00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:10,930
thing is really just practice saying no

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,900
anymore

00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,509
let's have some drink

00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:29,539
how ready and once you said yes to that

00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:35,900
player how do you deal with this kind of

00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:47,529
client who says he never sends the

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:47,529
content now okay so you said yes to this

00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:58,220
look but he never sends you their

00:44:54,410 --> 00:45:02,900
content and you start working you spend

00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:06,680
these hours so when my client says yes

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,839
to me they first get a checklist because

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,180
they need to create content and they

00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:13,039
send it to me in a Word document or any

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,739
Google Drive documents one or the other

00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,650
so I can check it if they did their

00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:20,539
homework the next thing is that when

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:25,160
they didn't when they don't send me the

00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:29,150
content I don't do any work so they said

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,400
yes they want a website not me I mean

00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,319
they said yes I send them the checklist

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,779
it's homework they have to do if they

00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:39,440
are not doing it fine by me

00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:40,039
if they did it they send me this sending

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,920
me an email

00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,499
okay so I did all the homework the the

00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,200
files are in Google Drive I picked up

00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:50,479
pictures there has been profile pictures

00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,099
taken I think I'm done can you check it

00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:55,339
I check it and then we make an

00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:57,469
appointment and before that and one day

00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:58,460
when it's not when it's not complete or

00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:01,760
and it's not correct

00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:06,020
I just don't start working

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,960
so and that is also very clear I need to

00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,550
have this I need to have all the content

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,770
for the homepage I need to have all the

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,020
content for the about Us page I need to

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:17,750
have all the content for your product

00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:20,450
page or pages and I need to have the

00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:24,020
content for your contact page that is it

00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:27,350
for our things and all the content is

00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,280
text videos images everything if it's

00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:32,119
not complete

00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,760
I do not start working for you so I

00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,920
don't mind how long you take because I

00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,050
have a lot of the thing with the the

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,250
good thing for me with working with the

00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:45,109
small chunks of of customer is like I

00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:48,170
get to do a lot of different things in

00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:50,540
my week which I really like because I

00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:52,160
only plan a week ahead and customers

00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,580
email me and I'm like yeah let's plan a

00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:00,140
date and see you next week so it's

00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:05,630
always your turn and always small chunks

00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:08,150
work for me as well I know I have to say

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,100
that I know Wendy very well and I learn

00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,590
from her I'm so privileged because I

00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,180
keep learning from her all the time and

00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,340
there is a lot to learn

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,410
one thing that Wendy does that is

00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,810
controversial and those of you who know

00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:24,530
WP elevation will understand is that

00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:26,359
Wendy does not take a deposit I have

00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:28,130
been told I have also done lots of

00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:31,609
business courses I've done WP elevation

00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:34,520
and what they say is do not even touch a

00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:37,520
project until the client gives you at

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,700
least 50% or a third depends on the

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,190
length of the project or the size Wendy

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:46,280
doesn't do that and I was like what are

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:48,650
you crazy that's like you know but she

00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,750
is right because she doesn't start

00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,980
working she keeps the proposal really

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,540
short so you don't take a long time in

00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,600
sending a client a proposal do you you

00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,840
just stand exactly standardized there

00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,119
you go so she doesn't take I I spend I

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,520
spend so long on proposals so I usually

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,960
get charged for a proposal which makes

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,760
it much more difficult because the

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,130
client goes oh I should charge you to

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,560
give me a proposal

00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:16,750
you know so she doesn't take any money

00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,300
first which means that it gives her the

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:22,960
freedom to not care so now what's

00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,850
happened to me is that about nine months

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,130
ago a client paid for the whole website

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,230
it's a small project so he paid in

00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,570
advance everything I still don't have

00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,340
the content I'm having to help him get

00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,590
into the Google Analytics account I've

00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,290
done lots of hours of work and I still

00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,570
haven't built the website and I hate him

00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:43,390
and I don't want to build the website

00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,300
because that money is gone ages ago

00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,590
so I think this is and to me every day I

00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,440
think oh my god maybe I should do like

00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,990
1d does and not do like the other

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:58,000
courses tell you so it's very much

00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:01,230
related to what you were saying so do do

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,230
