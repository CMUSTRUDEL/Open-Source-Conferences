Description: 
	I started my business to make money doing what I love.  For a long time, these 2 were mutually exclusive. I love working with small businesses but they are almost always on a small budget. In 2017 I redesigned my business to serve my favorite types of customers and make money in a sustainable way. You will get a close look into my business process, the tools I use, my workflow and my communication tactics to actually help my clients and sustain and grow my business.
