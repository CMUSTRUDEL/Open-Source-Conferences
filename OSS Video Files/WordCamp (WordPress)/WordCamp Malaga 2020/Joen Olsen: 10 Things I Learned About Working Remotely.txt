	00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,129
but then I started working remotely and

00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:17,060
everything changed

00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:18,890
hi my name is Joan Olson my name is I'm

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,350
a happiness engineer with automatic as

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,609
Rachel said and today I'm going to share

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,849
with you some things I learned in the

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:28,220
past three years working remotely and

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,400
I'd like to say to begin that it's clear

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,710
that the world is changing and work is

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,329
changing as well because this cartoon

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,700
that I just showed here is from the New

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,990
Yorker magazine from two years ago but

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,990
more and more people are working

00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,770
remotely but what does that actually

00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,560
mean

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,260
so first let's define what is remote

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,480
work there are we can say there is four

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,480
kinds of jobs anybody here who works

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,930
remotely already anybody here works in

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,630
an office good so we have the two sides

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,150
so there is the office job where you go

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,920
to the office every day and then there's

00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,040
a flexible job where you work at an

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,640
office but sometimes you work at home in

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,539
this remote job and at the remote job

00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,820
everybody else is at the office and

00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:15,289
you're working from home and then

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,570
there's what I do which is technically a

00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:20,210
distributed job where nobody goes to the

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,329
office everybody stays home so an

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,679
automatic we have saved for the tumblr

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,840
acquisition we have a thousand people

00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,649
all working from their homes in their

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,770
home offices co-working spaces cafes or

00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:35,600
anywhere as I'll get to I learned about

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,149
working remotely when I first applied

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,600
for automatic I was working in an office

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,979
on our WordPress consultancy gig and I

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,079
read that you can actually work for a

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,969
company in San Francisco living anywhere

00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,100
in the world and I thought this is

00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:50,810
magnificent because at this point my

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,670
career wasn't going very well here in

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,219
Spain and I was actually considering

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,420
moving to London or Copenhagen or San

00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,479
Francisco somewhere else where there

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,779
would be IT jobs but then in came the

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,369
remote work and Here I am it's a brave

00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:07,159
new world and I will say that it is

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:08,959
definitely a better way of working but

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,540
it also has its own particular

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
challenges if you already work from home

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,450
you can recognize some of these things

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,870
if you don't I hope to give you a little

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,830
bit of insight into how it works

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,090
the first thing I realized when I

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,500
started working remotely

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,700
there's no commute you don't go anywhere

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,920
that's a little bit strange but it's a

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,570
nice thing because I'm sure that you had

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,180
the experience where you have to be at a

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,620
meeting at 10:00 a.m. you're late you're

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,410
get in your car you go out on the road

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,060
and it's a traffic jam and now you're

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,800
there you're stuck in traffic and you're

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,910
half an hour late

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,280
this doesn't happen when you work

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,720
remotely because you might as well you

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,990
know be a minute late with your coffee

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,640
but everything happens online so you can

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,200
save a lot of time in not going back and

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,420
forth and if you think about it if you

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,370
only go half an hour to work and half an

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,709
hour back there's still five hours a

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,330
week that's five hours that you could be

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:05,940
spending doing something else being with

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,989
family friends developing WordPress the

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,170
other beauty is that you can work

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,959
anywhere and in the beginning I thought

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,090
this is fantastic I can work anywhere

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,110
with my laptop I'm gonna go to the beach

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,390
which turned out to be less productive

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,980
than I hoped because if you ever been

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,320
outside with your laptop especially the

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,140
new blank screens there is no

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,970
productivity you cannot see anything in

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,150
the same way I have some colleagues and

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,260
I try this myself who wake up take the

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:41,519
laptop in bed and start working no I

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,739
cannot do that I try going to a park the

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,100
same thing your outside what works

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,299
I found cafes cafes are good but then

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,160
you have to pay for the coffee to at

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,570
least be nice or you can go to a

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,269
co-working if you want to be with other

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,420
people or as I have found works best for

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,070
me having a home office because with all

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,000
the things all the flexibility being

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,799
anywhere in the world

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,350
just with a basic internet connection I

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,769
still found that it's good to have a

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,320
routine because if you consider before

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,970
we go into work we leave our house we'd

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,280
go out we experience the world come into

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,440
a new place and now we're working so

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,200
your mind has a chance to change the

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,810
environment and you're getting ready but

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,940
if you don't have that travel time your

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,560
mind doesn't switch so I found that

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,530
having a routine to get me started

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,050
simulates that experience so I will get

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,060
up around 8:00 a.m. I'll go to

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,360
bathroom brush my teeth I go downstairs

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,069
meditate I'll take my dog out and then

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,190
I'll exercise to get that crucial

00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:44,000
daylight in then have a shower and by 10

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,620
a.m. I'm at my desk so that's the way

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,449
that I found to kind of just make my

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,479
mind go into work mode and then when

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,490
sitting down to work it's important how

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,770
the environment is like and so I

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,509
discovered that just because you're

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,490
working from home you still have the

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,849
same challenges as you have an office

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,280
because at an office what do you get at

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:10,610
least you get a desk you get a chair and

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,219
a computer right now I had this I had

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,620
this set up when I moved houses I didn't

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,979
get my home office set up yet so what

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,550
did I do

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:23,000
i sat at my dining room table in an Ikea

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,819
chair anybody here who knows IKEA chairs

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,949
for sitting and eating they're very very

00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:32,270
stable when you sit down the legs go out

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,710
and the backrest is non-existent so not

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,479
thinking about this and just working

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,310
either my dining room table or my couch

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,639
after a while I start developing

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,349
shoulder pains and so I realize ok now

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,150
it's time to actually you know do

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,880
something about this so now I have a

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,449
proper desk that can also be raised so

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,009
you can be standing and a chair and

00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,740
these things are just important at home

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,449
at our office maybe even more so because

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,539
there's nobody looking after you you

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,099
have to look after yourself in a similar

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,120
way and I'll get into this a little bit

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,889
more you have to tune your mind into

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,949
when you're working and when you're not

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,050
working so this may seem a little bit

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,840
strange but what I found number one

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,389
works is working in one space have one

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,550
designated space to work it might be a

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,199
home office they might just be a desk it

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,110
might be a certain spot but in this pot

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,669
we're in work mode so I have made this

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,319
into my home office where I work in the

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,990
office and I don't work anywhere else if

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,080
I can't avoid it but at the same time

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,159
I've experimented with using all the

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,240
senses so for example I use music

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,720
anybody here listens to music when they

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,360
work

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,290
and the rest of you are sleeping okay no

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,990
just kidding

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,030
no music is a nice addition to the day

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,460
but what I have found is that I actually

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,580
take certain internet radio stations and

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,160
I only listen to that while working so

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,890
if this genre of music is playing we're

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,910
working if this song if music is playing

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,670
we are not working

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,250
it works somewhat and I've also

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,510
experimented do the same with smells you

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,910
know what make a Donna you can get those

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,580
cheap candles one of the cinnamon note

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,980
eleven ear so I experimented with like

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,770
okay can I subconsciously program myself

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:22,140
to let my brain know that when the

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:25,500
vanilla is on we're not working it kind

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:29,370
of works it's not great so really what

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,590
works is separating the things because

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,480
when you're working from home there are

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,480
so many distractions if you let there be

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,919
and the way that I realized this I mean

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,160
I actually thought about calling this

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,669
talk how to stay productive when your

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,930
entire house is a distraction and what

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm talking about here it's not just the

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,350
average phone calls messages Facebook

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,360
reddit or all the things we know we

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,580
shouldn't be doing during work I don't

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,440
do those but I can be caught up with

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,540
other things oh I have to go make a cup

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,970
of coffee oh there's this dish I forgot

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,800
to put into the lava here's there's this

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,050
little thing I have to do it's amazing

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,950
how our mind can take us anywhere apart

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,620
from what we're supposed to be doing

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,500
that's because I will admit I'm a

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,010
procrastinator so this is why I have

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,229
these little challenges but I also have

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,320
to say that from my perspective I don't

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:26,550
have kids so for those of you that do

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,940
have kids and work from home Wow well

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,650
done I also don't have cats so I don't

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,450
know how cats behave when you're working

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,120
from home but I've seen a lot of

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,860
colleagues that have tails walking

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,919
around on the screen when they're

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,980
talking on zoom' have you seen this so

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,750
with

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,450
dogs at least I can give you a tip

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,930
because my dog is very annoying oh

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:55,360
you're working can we play now clean out

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,640
and I feel bad cuz of course I want to

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,050
play but not right now so my colleague

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,600
gave me a tip she said if you're working

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,820
and your dog is annoying have it close

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,370
to you dogs are pack animals

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,350
if you move their bed to your desk they

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,930
will stay there and be happy and it

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,339
worked so I cannot tell you what to do

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,110
with your kids and I can't tell you we

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,810
do everything else but just know the

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,339
distractions are plentiful so it's about

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,480
finding ways around those distractions

00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:24,910
and one of those ways is to have clear

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,500
boundaries and what I mean by boundaries

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,630
is that you have anybody else living at

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,720
home with you it could be family

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,220
it could be roommates whatever it is

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,709
they need to understand when you're

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,709
working for those of you that already

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:42,519
work from home you may have said this to

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,570
people before yes I am really working it

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,430
may be that I'm just sitting here

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,260
looking at my laptop but I'm actually

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:52,329
doing work well this is how I do my work

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,380
so please don't interrupt me and this is

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,470
where it comes to setting healthy

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,630
boundaries so number one if you're in

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,110
the office you can leave the door open

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,670
but if I'm in here don't disturb me when

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,660
I come out talk to me

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,640
that works now why is this important

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,250
those of you that work from home hands

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,709
up again can I please get to shout out

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,790
what role do you do this in a daughter a

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,790
daughter cos'è

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,279
okay all these things have in common

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,810
that they are knowledge work so when we

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,699
sit down in from the computer we are

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,079
doing knowledge work and it's been

00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,000
scientifically shown that if we can

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,860
interrupt it if you're in the flow

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,380
you're just working everything like and

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,720
then you have interruption it takes an

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,060
average of 15 minutes to get back into

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,170
that flow so it's extremely important to

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,180
not be interrupted while you're doing

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,699
something important and instead do that

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,649
afterwards so one thing can be like I

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,480
said telling people it can also just be

00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,550
closing the door because I found that if

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,910
you have guests over especially if

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,780
they're not off the internet age they

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,940
may not understand that you

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,160
working so just closing the door might

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,620
be enough but more importantly is about

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,840
setting expectations and that as well it

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,570
goes to communication which brings me to

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,150
my next point because working remotely

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,550
you have some distinct challenges in

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,710
terms of communication I work at

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,560
automatic and automatic we do all of our

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:24,940
main communication in slack anybody here

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,830
uses slack yes most of us and slack is

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,080
text only communication by default and

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,430
that's how we do it on automatic now of

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,590
course there are also audio calls and

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,840
video calls but when you communicate

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,690
only inviting there are particular

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,060
challenges there was a study from Yale

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,430
way back when then looked at how people

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,310
perceive when you're talking to them and

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,190
as it turns out the actual words that we

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:52,420
say are only seven percent of the full

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:55,630
communication 38% comes from our voice

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,170
our tonality how we say it and a full

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,600
fifty five percent comes from the body

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,530
language so in automatic we talked a

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,310
little bit about the concept of

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,050
bandwidth not your 56 56k modem versus

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,810
your fiber but bandwidth in

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:14,440
communication so if we say that if it's

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:18,160
only in text that's low bandwidth if it

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,880
goes an audio call medium bandwidth you

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,550
go on a zoom video call high bandwidth

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,740
but if you are in person face to face

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,830
that's full bandwidth and in my opinion

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,970
nothing can ever replace that which

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,990
brings me to my next point

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,130
that is important to socialize so if

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,500
you're living with other people this is

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,630
not a problem but if you live alone and

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,070
you are working from home there is

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,270
technically no reason to leave your

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,580
house some days if I didn't have my dog

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,380
I didn't have to go out and I do have a

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,700
colleague who says that he will say him

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,610
for three days at a time

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,880
he gets the groceries delivered it stays

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,260
in so it's really important when we're

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,540
in front of a screen all day to actually

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,950
go out and meet other people and have

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,230
that connection which also brings me to

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,420
going afk this is a term that will use

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,440
an automatic anybody here knows what afk

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,640
means

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,350
one but you're cheating you working

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:22,370
automatic afk afk is an English acronym

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,140
that means away from keyboard and I

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,390
don't know about you but I tend to be

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,990
caught up and I get really focused and

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,910
then I forget to have breaks what I

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,800
didn't say my routine thing is that I

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,170
will also put my lunch on my calendar so

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,700
I don't forget because there is nobody

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,100
saying hey we're going to lunch do you

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,350
want to come no that doesn't happen so

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,209
you have to do it yourself and so

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,010
throughout the day it's very important I

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,440
find to just step away from the computer

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,260
know that you have a real world before

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,170
you go back into the digital one in the

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,149
same way when getting off work I also

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,820
try to stay away from screens in fact I

00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,130
just try to leave my laptop in the

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,860
office and not open again

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,110
even when logging off I will have a

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,050
shutdown routine where I turn off the

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,490
security so that I don't accidentally

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,589
log on to work again and start working

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,510
because again you're working from

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:20,810
anywhere so you have to set your

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:23,570
boundaries and finally it's about

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,850
disconnecting and this I think applies

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,220
to anybody that is working in front of a

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,870
computer in office but what I'm talking

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,370
about here is doing things that are

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:37,010
truly offline there's no computers

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:42,170
there's no phones there's no internet

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:43,470
connection now where can you do this out

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,970
in nature

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,220
a la playa without the laptop going to

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,670
the woods going for a hike going for a

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,620
run

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,140
I think these are incredibly important

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,720
because we are all sitting at a computer

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,120
all day and while many of us have given

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,600
up smoking now they say that sitting is

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,280
the new smoking so now I at least tried

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,930
to get outside and move but I find that

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:13,590
being in nature is kind of like an

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:17,580
antidote to all the technical input so

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:22,020
to answer the question do I work from

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:27,680
home or am i living at work the answer

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,680
is both but it works if you're separated

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,220
so the world is changing and work is

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,740
changing and my question to you if you

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,030
don't work remotely its remote work in

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,620
your future thank you

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,620
[Applause]

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,930
any quest hola any question

00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:06,009
hola well so yeah more than a question

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,629
is just sharing my experience because I

00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:12,360
also work in a distributed company

00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:14,350
everybody from home co-working whatever

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,209
and there is a point that has been

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,389
really important for me and you don't

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:23,079
mention it I would like to mention and

00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:25,060
more than these times of how many time

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,730
can I be focused and when I am

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,860
distracted how long I take to be again

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,410
in productive mode it's quite a common

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,610
thing but to me this approach never work

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:41,290
and what really worked to me is mix what

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:45,220
are the distractions with the tasks that

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,470
I have so I try to know what front the

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,199
task I have to do one or two days

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,240
upfront because more it's difficult and

00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:55,779
then I try to pack them

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,259
I'm schedule the interruptions as as

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:01,389
disconnection and managing is like I

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,649
will do these that I need two hours then

00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,350
I can do this two hours and they'll go

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,329
out shopping for half an hour and then I

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,630
got the groceries for lunch then I work

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,819
one hour for this task and then and this

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,439
kind of approach work it for me because

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:18,189
at the beginning I was trying to keep

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,890
like yeah two hours a break and these

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,870
things and this never work it because it

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,179
depends on the tasks and to meet more

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:28,059
important time that you invest and focus

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:30,250
in the task then the focus time at work

00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,530
so right yes so it should so you built

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,330
in breaks where you go and do something

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,919
else for example I said going the

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,700
grocery shopping and you put that in

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,960
your schedule are you doing okay but the

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,090
point is to give yourself work time and

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,419
then you go out I think that's very very

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,360
good

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:50,010
yeah thank you for sharing that oh

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,010
that's begun to us or other questions

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:58,040
that's for the conference very

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,160
interesting but

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,560
Steamies do you have settle everything

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,990
but what do you think is gonna be the

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,470
first step to do when you decide to

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,230
start to work remotely for me like

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,510
passion and how I dress like that's wish

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,090
to the to the company thank you can you

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,030
say that one more time the first thing

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:23,110
the first thing its what how is that to

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,660
become every more right okay yeah sure

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,640
I'm Michael bunny thank you

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,440
absolutely so now there's actually I've

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,820
learned about since coming into this

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,710
world that there is actually a lot of

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,880
companies that do remote work some of

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,310
the more famous ones are of course

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,370
automatic I believe a human-made that's

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,990
the same as well there's also Basecamp

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,250
which is very famous and has been you

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,410
know remote for years and years and

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,350
years but there are some resources that

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,690
I believe is there's one called we work

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,980
or as we work remotely but the point is

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,410
that just like they have job databases

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,480
you have databases for remote work and

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,660
so more and more and more these are

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,270
coming up now also ironically I just

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,430
read that with the coronavirus they're

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,320
asking people to stay home so it's

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,660
actually a forced experiment and having

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,820
people work from home and so I didn't go

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,640
much past the headline but I said are

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,460
they coming back to the office nobody

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,840
knows so it might be changing just for

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,490
the corona virus but there's plenty of

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,690
resources out there and if you want I

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,370
can give you my card afterwards and I

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,180
can send you those actual links I don't

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:30,170
remember them right now cool

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,670
anyone else anybody else here would like

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,970
to share their experiences was working

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,970
from home

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,039
well I also work from home but I do have

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,559
kids so funny days a little bit

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,840
different I would start to HIV up about

00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,760
seven starts at eight and then try and

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,309
get the whole day done as quickly as

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,730
possible without any breaks and try and

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,640
finish around 4:00 4:30 and then have my

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,620
day do all the other bits afterwards but

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,299
dividing my day up to have little breaks

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,440
in between it just makes it so long and

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,899
then I don't have any time and family

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,429
time so I think it's just finding the

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,720
right pattern it took me a long time to

00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,639
get into that pattern as well but I

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,059
think it you have to find what works for

00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,700
you

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,470
and do you find also that you don't have

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,440
to travel does that give you more time

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,630
with the family or is it yes but I I

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,880
agree with you the not traveling you

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,789
missed that kind of time disconnecting

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,710
and you just kind of thrown into it

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,539
thrown out of it and I missed that a

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:37,659
little bit but I also worked from home

00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:42,039
before school thank you for sharing

00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:43,990
Rachel all right anybody else no I would

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,360
say thank you all for staying so late

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,429
thank you for listening and if you want

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,789
to work remotely I can you know point

00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,789
you to some resources

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,299
