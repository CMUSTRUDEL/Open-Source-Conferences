Title: Shane Rielly: Escape the feast and famine cycle and increase your recurring revenue.
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	Many freelancers and design agencies are well aware of the feast and famine cycle that exists. Finding new work is a challenge but it is a constant requirement for generating income in your business. When there is no new work there is no income and cash flow becomes a massive challenge.
The antidote is to generate recurring revenue, preferably on a monthly basis. In this talk I will cover some ways to increase MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) and how it benefits you and your clients.

okay so I'm gonna just start by telling

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,740
you a little bit about myself as you

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,170
heard I'm a landlocked surfer that's me

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,080
over there in Namibia at probably the

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,089
most incredible natural thing in the

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,100
whole world that wave breaks like that

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,710
for two kilometers I'm sure most of you

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,820
have no idea what that means but it's

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,039
amazing that is me at 19 years old when

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,439
I left school I didn't go to university

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,160
I have no tertiary education I'm

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,030
completely self-taught and so I left

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,820
school and a very naively thought that I

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,920
would have a super successful clothing

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,120
business so I started a surf clothing

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,410
brand that was that there and that was

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,910
about 20 years ago and I'm slow starting

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,890
businesses like that

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,320
Warwick dude who said he's done 17 of

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,230
them and failed I haven't done that many

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,500
but that's basically laughs okay that's

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,690
my beautiful wife Lindsey she is a sign

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,430
language interpreter at verts University

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,580
which is partly why we live here in

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,659
Johannesburg those are my two kids

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,909
summer and Ezekiel yeah and they're

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,259
awesome cool so that's a little bit

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,830
about me the feast and famine cycle and

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,720
why it sucks okay so the feast and

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,610
famine cycle does everyone know what

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,409
that is I'm sure you do if you're in

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,560
this room okay so I've been doing it for

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,380
20 years basically it's like when you

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,420
get a big job or a whole bunch of big

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,340
jobs all at once and then the money

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,860
comes pouring down and you think this is

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,810
it like I've made it and then two months

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,759
later you've literally got no work and

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,479
it's dried up and you've had to learn

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,970
the skill of not spending all that money

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,530
when it comes in so when my wife and I

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,720
were married she worked with me in the

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,520
business I had at the time which was

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,100
basically doing graphic design and video

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,130
production and so we made videos for

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,590
government in the Eastern Cape and they

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,129
would typically pay a night take 90 to

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,099
120 to 150 days to pay and some of those

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,080
jobs were really lucrative but there

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,580
were months where like I would make 500

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,350
bucks

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,390
there were months where I'd make like 85

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,550
grand you know so that's kind of the

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:23,540
feast and famine cycle and you have to

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,860
learn how to love well below what your

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,600
income is on those Hartman's and then

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,150
learn how to like so that you'd have

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,000
money left when there's nothing right so

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,460
what I'm talking about today is how some

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,790
different ways and one sort of way in

00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,440
particular that we can employ so that we

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,170
don't have to live that feast and famine

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,180
cycle so by generating recurring revenue

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:52,220
so whether that's monthly recurring

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:55,060
revenue or annual okay so this is my

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,080
current business called lonely parking

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,580
lots of people want to know where the

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,650
name comes from so I'll just tell you

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,860
quickly I started the business by myself

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,690
I have Scandinavian heritage I wanted a

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,760
name that sounds cool that's memorable

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,000
that doesn't necessarily mean anything I

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,380
was driving in the car I thought I'm

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,910
like really sad lonely no I'm kidding I

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,239
thought lonely barking sounds cool

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,430
and I immediately had an idea for a logo

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,020
and I was like that's too easy and then

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,260
I did that logo on the same day so

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,209
that's the story behind that um

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,550
currently I have a business partner

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,760
Martin he's just sitting over there I'm

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,980
him and I teamed up probably about ten

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,140
months ago I'm he's a full-stack

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,010
developer currently working at Stan a

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,320
bank and so he's got a complementary

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,220
skill set and so we work really well

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,770
together okay so some ideas for

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,660
generating that's stands for monthly

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,420
recurring revenue or annual recurring

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,100
revenue I prefer monthly because I mean

00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,780
you get it every month even though it

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,730
works out to the same amount at the end

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,110
of the year technically but it just

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,850
feels better have you ever heard of this

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:13,910
thing called eighty three point three

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:16,430
three okay so if you take if you can get

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,320
a thousand clients to pay you eighty

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,620
three around thirty three each per month

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,320
so let's say eighty four and that

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,360
equates to one million round in turnover

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,759
in a year okay

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,280
which sounds ridiculous right it sounds

00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,139
like okay if I can get 84 and a month

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,409
from a thousand people that's a million

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:38,090
Wren turnover yeah which for some milena

00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,069
and two ANOVA is like well that's we're

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,020
just playing games and for other people

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,550
a million rand a year is like what the

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,949
heck like I literally wouldn't know what

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,539
to do with myself okay but I think it's

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,699
just interesting in it and if you look

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,169
at it like this because a thousand

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:55,069
people sounds like quite a lot if you

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,979
could get 350 random month from 250

00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:02,090
people that's basically it's like a

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:04,690
million rand and to do a Jacob Zuma a

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:11,870
million rand and five thousand rand and

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:15,650
okay so 350 Rand per client per month

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,990
for 250 clients and that's a melon

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,389
renter in over a year so the reason I

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,830
tell you that is firstly because it will

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,240
probably drive you crazy because it's

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,129
such a small amount of money that you

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,490
think I'm sure I can get people to give

00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:30,590
me 84 bucks but it's also just to get

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,900
you thinking that like it's not that

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,349
difficult right if you can think of

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,419
something to do to that give somebody

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,710
value but it's not such an astronomical

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,620
amount of money that they're like I

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,690
really don't spend it um there are a lot

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,509
of people who can pay you 350 around a

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:54,319
month it's definitely more than 250 of

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:55,699
them okay so what are some ideas and the

00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,940
one thing I wanna say before go to the

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,729
next slide is this often we can think of

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,110
this recurring revenue thing as good for

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,520
me but not good for my client because

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,919
they've got to pay for something okay so

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,139
the basis for this is that you've got to

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,310
provide value to your clients you've got

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,229
to give them something that they're

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,960
value that you've not tricked them into

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,550
to giving you money every month so we're

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,639
going to just keep that in mind when we

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:24,650
keep going okay so here are some ideas

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,120
and you've heard from whole bunch of

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,710
different talks and the panel you would

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,270
have heard probably of most of these

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,770
things digital products is one thing so

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,080
like courses like Warrick was talking

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,270
about these are things you put the work

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,710
in upfront but they continue generating

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,260
revenue

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,420
obviously if you get sales things like

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,580
plugins that you can our

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,380
subscription-based and then product

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,840
tasks services which is essentially

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,600
taking your service packaging at like a

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,280
product giving it a set price and then

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,840
the most important part is giving rules

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,600
for the for the consumer the buyer so

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,820
because what we're used to is providing

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
a service but my client can phone me

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,980
anytime he wants or she can send me an

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,050
email anytime she wants the thing with a

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,540
product a service is that you package it

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,120
like a product and it's got its got

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,160
rules of how the the consumer the

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,460
customer can use it okay which frees you

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,840
up so there there's a support email

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,400
address if you want support you've got

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,500
it you've got email that email address

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,810
we get back to you with it within a

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,030
certain amount of time something like

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,860
that right so it takes the pressure off

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,380
of you to constantly be answering your

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,380
phone stuff like that so if you think of

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,450
a service that you provide and then turn

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,510
that into a product whatever that might

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,510
be

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,210
turnkey websites which Antron mentioned

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,070
in her talk earlier and so Martin and

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,070
are busy building that and the the the

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,810
reason we doing that and I'll tell you

00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,830
our plan sort of is so we build custom

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,750
built websites and provide marketing and

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,090
lead generation and stuff for our

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,710
clients but we get a lot like engine was

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,030
saying a lot of clients whose budget is

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,680
too low for that service that we provide

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,820
so then we either turn them away or

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,860
refer them to somebody actually we've

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,270
never referred to anybody we just turn

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,260
them away because I didn't know anybody

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,810
who wants to do sites at that price so

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,020
we're building the system and we kind of

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,550
half way in they instead of using the

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,940
WordPress dashboard they get like a

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,650
little settings page they they put their

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,090
business name their logo they pick some

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,520
colors with the color picker and it

00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,760
literally fills in that template with

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,850
that predefined content so now part of

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,470
our funnel is to they fill in a form on

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,360
our website if they select that their

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,880
budget is lower than like the lowest

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,470
that will go it automatically sends them

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,540
email and it says thank you for your

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,880
inquiry unfortunately it says it in

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,980
really nice way we don't do work for

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
less than that but he has the service go

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,490
and then it sends them to a landing page

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,100
where there's a video that explains to

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,010
them how it works and so the thinking

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,320
behind that was that look we can't do

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,970
the work for you because those clients

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,350
we provide a service where you can pick

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,180
up the phone and Furness if you need

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,620
something but you need to pay for the

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,780
privilege of talking to us like that

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,740
okay and so essentially we like we still

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,270
want their business

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,980
we still want their money we still want

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,260
to provide them with a good service and

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,330
a good product but we literally don't

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:37,010
have the time or energy to do that so

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:40,340
that's the idea behind that marketing

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,370
services like organic and paid traffic

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,090
SEO PPC conversion rate optimisation

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,830
content creation and marketing some of

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,990
those things you can get your clients to

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,610
pay for on a monthly basis with set

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,240
parameters like I'll give you you know

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:59,750
this much content or however you want

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,850
that to work and then what I mentioned

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,850
earlier in the panel discussion white

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,160
label partnerships so you can basically

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,650
get somebody else to do that you get a

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,570
white label SEO and they'll do the SEO

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,030
for you but the client is on your books

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,870
you get a stay they charge your set fee

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,990
you put a markup on that that's nice

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,690
because you don't have to upskill so

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,160
like but you also don't you let's say

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,140
you've built a website for a client and

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,480
they desperately need lead generation so

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,960
they want some traffic on their site you

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,780
don't know how to do Facebook PPC you

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,130
don't know how to do SEO but you don't

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,490
want to send them to somebody else for

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,860
that you can find white label partners

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,720
and then you can get them to do the work

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,880
it stays on your books some of them have

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
it set up so well that they're actually

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,480
even through the support channel they'll

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,190
use your support email address and

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,710
they're literally actors they're a part

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,660
of your business and then you just put a

00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,920
markup on that so that means you don't

00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,840
have to obscure you don't necessarily

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,200
like have to do the work you kind of

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,230
their sales person in a way and then you

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,090
can get some recurring revenue like that

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,920
this is just an example of luck some way

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,240
to provide value for clients is to give

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,030
them stuff that they've not seen before

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,360
that luck makes them understand so if

00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,730
you want to you can tell a client about

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,540
a funnel and you can tell them okay

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,400
first you like someone clicks on a paid

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,080
ad it takes them to a landing page it

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,490
does this if they do that they go there

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,620
if it doesn't they go down there and

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,470
then there's this whole funnel system

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:41,480
and this is actually our funnel for when

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:43,970
we get a new client and so you can try

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,070
to explain that to a client and them

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,530
will just be like okay it sounds cool

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,000
but when you show them this you showing

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,920
them basically how you're going to give

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,570
them value and then you can explain how

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,490
you're going to tweak it if things don't

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,600
work with you keep track of all the

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,580
analytics stuff like that okay and then

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,250
this is where I'm really gonna focus and

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,140
that's on website care plans and you

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,940
might hear it called maintenance plans

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,220
the reason we call it care plans is

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,760
because care plan sounds much nicer than

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,950
maintenance plan okay

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,780
maintenance sounds like you got divorced

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,510
then you have to pay the money and you

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,140
really don't want to okay so maybe

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:27,380
that's just me but website care means

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,940
it's it sounds valuable like we and we

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,350
really believe that it is valuable we're

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,320
not trying to trick these clients into

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,620
giving us money but I'm gonna go a

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,800
little bit deeper into what these

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:43,160
website care plans look like and why

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,740
they are awesome okay so that's DJ Jazzy

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Jeff and The Fresh Prince it's a win win

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,720
for you and for your clients okay so you

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,090
are getting monthly recurring revenue

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,530
and they're getting value and now it

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,820
goes back to also what I was saying

00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,360
earlier you've got to have the right

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,950
clients you could have clients that it's

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,170
a grudge purchase for them every month

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,700
because they some I think they can do it

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,750
all themselves which they technically

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,120
can but if you've got the right clients

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:15,080
they are paying you for peace of mind

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,470
and for for taking the trouble of their

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,000
hands right so it really is one when and

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,650
then they can be heavily

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,690
automated which is awesome for you I

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:28,090
love that gift and so basically and I'm

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,610
going to show you a little bit of this

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,950
you can automate almost the entire like

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,520
most of the steps of the k plans that we

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:40,010
offer are automated so it means we're

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,110
generating revenue but we've got time to

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,910
spend on on building our processes

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,740
you've heard the saying that says a

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,300
business owner should be working on

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,300
their business not in their business

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,700
okay so that's that's our goal is that

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,830
we want to work on the processes of our

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,840
business want to work on like the

00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,580
marketing and the sales and all of that

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,770
stuff but the more time we spend working

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,110
in it doing the actual stuff we don't

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,540
get to work on that so the more

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,470
automation we can do without being too

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,480
impersonal is the way to go okay so I'm

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,600
going to show you these little pricing

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,250
things from our website you can judge

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,230
the pricing if you want to you might

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,210
think we ripping people off you might

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,210
think it's crazy low that's up to you

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm going to tell you what they include

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,000
so our base one is 350 around a month

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:33,080
that includes hosting that's hosted on a

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,580
VPS it's not on shared hosting because

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,880
obviously shared hosting there's some

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,100
security concerns we do the WordPress

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,210
core and theme updates and plug-in

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,300
updates which is automated so that's

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,040
easy we do one monthly off-site backup

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,710
so typically these would be clients who

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,320
like their SATs aren't critical they're

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,690
not like constantly updating content so

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,510
they only need a backup once a month and

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,730
then it includes like a page builder

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,850
like beaver builder or elemental because

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:07,100
we have the developer license so then

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,740
that that alleviates them having to pay

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,890
for that so we bundle that in and that's

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,680
one of the ways we provide value is like

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,570
you'll see in the later ones we bundle

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,460
plugins in we get the developer license

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,010
so that we can bundle that into the

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,510
package they don't have to go to the

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,010
effort of finding out which plug-in to

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,930
use they don't have to know how to

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,170
install it they don't have to pay for it

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,089
and so because you know how to do this

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,680
you might think it's so easy they can

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,480
just do it themselves it's true they

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,920
can just do it themselves but it doesn't

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,600
mean that you ripping someone off

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,790
because they can do it themselves right

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,300
that you providing value they don't have

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:48,140
to go and learn and so I think it's

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:51,050
great okay and then the next one is 800

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,630
bucks a month it includes all of that

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:57,230
and then it's a daily security scan

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,149
it's got like extra heart and security

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,700
for malware prevention and stuff

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,410
it's got daily off-site backups and

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,649
that's those backups are redundant so

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,270
they're stored in two different places

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,270
and none of them are locally because

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,430
that's a well ones locally to our

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,230
off-site okay but if you only got a

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,570
local backup on your server that's a bad

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:22,370
idea so please have a redundant backup

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,770
there's uptime monitoring and then we

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,899
get pinged if if the shot goes down and

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,630
we handle it immediately and then we say

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,160
your site was down but we fixed it we

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,040
set up Google Analytics for them and

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,950
they get a free SSL certificate provided

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,080
they're hosted on our hosting and then

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,010
that monthly reports I'm going to go

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,200
through with you

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,450
to set in because it's really important

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,029
that's part of the main part of the

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,459
value that the client gets from us okay

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,580
you can see this one doll is in in

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:55,940
dollars so we've set up that page on our

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,430
website so that it checks the visitors

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,380
location via the IP address and then

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,820
some JavaScript changes the price from

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,620
rounds to dollars if they're not in

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,630
south-africa just so that we can like we

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,920
charge less to South Africans because we

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,990
know what it's like to always pay in

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,370
dollars and it sucks so if you from

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,770
overseas you get to pay a little bit

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:22,670
more which we like that one in that one

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,140
includes so we go a bit deeper with the

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,670
Google Analytics set up and we set up

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,100
some goals for them and stuff like that

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,679
after we've we've had a little meeting

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,780
and then I get like a more detailed

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,820
traffic report then we also include

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,429
speed optimization which you could use

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,590
like WP rocket or Swift performance or

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:43,720
something like that but the server we

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:46,970
run on has also got optimization with

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,480
breeze and that other one that starts

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,169
with a V

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,080
remember and then we have a CDN built in

00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:55,940
there so the content is distributed and

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,100
then we include three hours of support

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,500
time so that's basically we'll update

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,720
your content for you we'll fix little

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,600
things but it excludes major design

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,919
changes and feature and functionality

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,570
changes and then this one if I'm honest

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,860
is they're just so that that one looks

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:19,340
more attractive but this one's got

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,290
hourly backups a weekly report two

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,929
different weekly reports it's got a

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,110
priority support and unlimited support

00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:29,720
um but so far nobody's taken it but lots

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,460
of people have taken that one so it was

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:40,490
just a marketing ploy but don't judge

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:43,490
okay so you wondering how am I going to

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,980
convince people to go for this so ideas

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,590
for getting care plan clients this was

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,490
difficult in the beginning because

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,370
traditionally you build a website and

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,890
you say cool go on your way and then

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,210
it's like every time they need something

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,630
they find you and you charge them an

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,460
hourly rate or something like that this

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,020
just works out so much better and some

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,360
of our clients use up those three hours

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,490
every month some only use one some use

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,380
three some months and like twenty

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,940
minutes some months and none of them

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,200
ever complain for that like they have

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,559
the peace of mind knowing that their

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,730
websites cared for and especially for

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,260
those way it's critical to their

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,120
business which is the kind of clients

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,160
that we're looking for they know that

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,910
this arts always up if it's not up we

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,200
get pinged and we make sure that we make

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,130
sure that it's up as quickly as possible

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,809
if the site gets hacked we clean it but

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:38,120
we've never had a hacked site on this

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:39,799
hosting so but we will do that okay so

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,960
here are some things you can do now we

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,790
can talk about ethics later okay I know

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,330
you all hate getting called emails and

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,270
stuff but they do work so you can scrape

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,690
for emails scraping such a horrible term

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,940
it sounds so gross but basically we've

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,750
got one tool that we use where you do a

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,100
google map search and then the that

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,899
search

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,940
extracts data from Google my business

00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:07,190
and it gives you email addresses and

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,799
names and stuff and then we've got an

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,360
automated system where and so that'll be

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,980
for like a niche so you can search like

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,870
the interests in pretoria or whatever

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,519
and it'll give you their email addresses

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:22,700
and then Martin wrote a Python script

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,710
that basically gathers information so

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,350
it'll get the URL of their website it

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,919
visits the website a test how fast it

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,710
loaded

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
does it have Google Analytics is it

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,029
running WordPress because if it's not

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,740
we're not interested does it run

00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:43,419
WordPress is the WordPress version

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:47,179
out-of-date takes a screenshot and then

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:50,269
based on that if it fails the WordPress

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,860
thing then we exclude it if it doesn't

00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:55,130
it gets into like a cold emailing

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,860
platform that then populates the email

00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:01,360
with merge tags for their specific data

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,830
so so called email you know like I said

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,769
ethically I don't know where you stand

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,880
on that but what we found is like if you

00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:13,760
personalize it that doesn't seem so

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,740
intrusive and so that's what we do we we

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,559
put a screenshot of their website and

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,110
then with some info we noticed your site

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,950
loads really slowly or your WordPress is

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:28,880
out of date or whatever and then that's

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,440
one way to get clients and then the

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
other is like communicating with your

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,399
existing clients or clients that you've

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,669
worked with before and communications

00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:41,179
the key so we did an a/b split test of

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:42,830
emails one was like a fear-based email

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,080
and one was like a value-based

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,940
email and so the one was like what is

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,549
gonna happen if your site gets hacked or

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,950
goes down or whatever and we didn't make

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,139
any sales out of that but the

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,549
value-based one we made like a whole

00:21:54,139 --> 00:22:00,260
bunch of sales so my advice would be if

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,269
you're gonna cut if you're going to do

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,360
something like this and you want to go

00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,710
for your existing clients it is hard for

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,179
them because they're like well I didn't

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,679
have to pay this money before why do I

00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:11,360
have to pay it now so that's why you've

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,860
got to communicate that value the the

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,600
fear thing really doesn't work

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,970
it just makes people annoyed I think

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,960
like after I said called email I felt

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:26,340
like it just got really awkward in yes

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:29,039
yeah like I said already to communicate

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,929
the value again we do the bundled

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,700
plugins we do the bundled page builders

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,250
I'm sorry to the devs I know this hate

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,740
for the page of page builders but it

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,200
makes business sense and then you've got

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,840
to take opportunities okay and when Dan

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,730
was speaking earlier it actually made me

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,730
think Gutenberg's an opportunity for us

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,650
to send out an email and say luck but

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,080
this is a fair way what are you gonna do

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,760
when Gutenberg comes and takes your site

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,419
down because you didn't respond to my

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,640
last email no the thing is you send that

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,260
email politely warn them send it with a

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,570
link to an article of what could happen

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,270
if that happens the first person they're

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,130
going to call is you right and then you

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:10,500
get to be the hero that steps in there

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,000
and sells them something every month for

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,890
the rest of their lives there was a joke

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,809
so some other examples are like you know

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:25,559
when recently Google Maps API like they

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:28,169
released the statement and saying that

00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,419
basically the Google Maps APR is no

00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:33,150
longer free it is technically free

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,460
because none of my clients get enough

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,090
calls for it to be paid for but it's an

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:42,090
opportunity to say we sent out an email

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,799
because we had all our clients which is

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,130
probably not best practice but on our

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:49,350
own API key and so we sent out an email

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,820
to say collectively we're going to go

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,280
over that threshold so you've either got

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,970
to send us an API key that we can put

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,100
into your website or you can go on to

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,309
one of our care plans and then it'll be

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,940
covered another thing is like Google

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,590
with the SSL now in chrome it says not

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,200
secure now if you don't have an SSL

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,539
certificate so because we include SSL in

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,520
our care plans we send them an email to

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,590
say if you're on one of our care plans

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,620
you'll have SSL none of them know how to

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,360
set up SSL then we say if you don't want

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,890
to be on a care plan we'll set up SSL

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,320
for you a once-off fee of X amount and

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:32,460
we've gotten a few clients like

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,919
and then every time we get it like a new

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,450
plug-in that we use for certain clients

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,979
so like a lot of our clients had the

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,049
free Yoast plug-in then we got SEO press

00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:45,059
a dev license and then we sent out an

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,649
email to everyone to say hey it's being

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:51,149
included on everyone who's got a care

00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:52,710
plan but it goes to everyone okay I'm

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:56,580
cool I'm gonna have to run through this

00:24:52,710 --> 00:25:00,839
really quickly so practically here are

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,179
three services you can use to kind of

00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,099
automate this process of a lot of it

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,080
okay so the first one is called main WP

00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,059
and that's a self-hosted one so you've

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,889
got to set it up the nice thing is you

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,469
can pay three three hundred ninety nine

00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:15,690
dollars four hundred dollars one soft

00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:17,249
lifetime license and you can use it on

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,859
as many sites as you like so it's very

00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,659
attractive from that point of view I'll

00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,259
go through what they do just a little

00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:27,210
bit there's another one called infinite

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:29,669
WP they essentially do the same thing

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:33,029
this is one we use it's called manage WP

00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:35,339
it's a slack software as-a-service it's

00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:39,089
not self hosted and I'm going to run

00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,499
through quickly that with you so here's

00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:42,119
what it does it does backups you can

00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:47,089
choose monthly backups which are free

00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:50,609
you can get daily backups or you can get

00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:54,839
twelve hourly backups or even luck you

00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:56,669
can get backups that run like what's

00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,239
that word all the time I'm gonna

00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:01,799
remember and so that's cool we use it

00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,509
also for cloning if we have to move

00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,049
sites it's makes it super easy to move

00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:09,570
websites you can bulk update a whole

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,309
bunch of websites all at once all the

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,440
plugins and you can do that with safe

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:16,859
updates so it'll run it you say safe

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,809
update or run a backup before it updates

00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,599
everything so you can roll back to that

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,580
if anything goes wrong and it takes

00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,320
screenshots as well and it compares them

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,789
so it can tell you this page doesn't

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,859
look like it did before do you want us

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:31,049
to roll back which is really cool it

00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:34,679
does scheduled update so you can tell it

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:37,629
like every Sunday morning at 3 a.m.

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,929
update everything it's got templates

00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,759
which is like basically you can take a

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:44,499
like your stack that you always use for

00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,749
a client websites or all the plugins and

00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:48,219
themes and stuff and make a template out

00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:50,289
of it and every time you get a new

00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:53,169
client you hit one button and it does an

00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:55,239
install of everything all at once

00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:57,070
tags and labels so we got those

00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,080
different plans we tagged our clients

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,559
like that and then you can just select

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,019
all the ones for a specific tag and run

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,789
updates on just those it's got

00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:11,649
integrations with like Google Analytics

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:13,809
stuff like that for the reporting you

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:17,200
can collaborate so you can get like VA s

00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:19,779
and devs and stuff to be on your team

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,669
and then that allows them to log into

00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,259
the WordPress back-end of each site by

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,999
clicking a button so you never have to

00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:27,639
give them a password they can log in via

00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:29,529
there which is quite nice if that's

00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:31,539
where you want to do it you can white

00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,099
label the plug-in so in your clients

00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:37,479
back-end if they log in it will say

00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:39,549
lonely Viking care plan whatever and

00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:43,330
then the reporting is the thing that we

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,739
found our clients love and so I'm going

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,059
to just run through quickly what one of

00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:48,190
those looks like so it'll have their

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:50,080
name and this is actually a real one

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,200
I've just blocked out who the client is

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,109
just because it's their daughter so you

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,330
can have a thing they're a little

00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:59,979
message and then it tells them this is

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,129
an overview these are how many updates

00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:06,309
run up time side sessions there's the

00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:10,359
Google page views the websites clean

00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:11,739
it's got their page score speed score it

00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:14,799
tells them all the plugins that were

00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:17,080
updated and how many times themes ok

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,570
that doesn't run on 2017 but the other

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,899
theme was not updated in those in that

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,820
month I told them your site has 109

00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:27,549
restore points 39 of those were made

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,799
this month that's the most recent backup

00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:37,929
use a screenshot to say your site looks

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:39,909
cool 100% well 99.98% up tom and then

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:42,879
this is what they really dig it's a very

00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:44,799
simple Google Analytics thing but a lot

00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:47,849
of clients love to know actually what

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,849
was happening on their site

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:53,920
security the website get scanned every

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,020
day it's clean okay

00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,350
that's that's a bit slow and we working

00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,030
on that and then we send also for

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,830
clients on the higher ones we send these

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,370
detailed ones that's Google Analytics

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,809
and you can see like we did some PPC and

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,549
stuff for them and it shows them their

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:11,230
traffic went up five hundred and ninety

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,950
eight percent they love seeing stuff

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:19,059
like that so that's nice and then this

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,790
is their Facebook performance on their

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,220
PPC so they love getting these things

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,500
that they can that they can organize I

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,640
mean that they can understand and that's

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,640
me now go make it rain

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,900
