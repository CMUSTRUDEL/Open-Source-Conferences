mm-hmm okay so welcome to this

00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,090
lightening sessions um so yeah most of

00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,150
you know who I am and she's in the room

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,400
so I'm just gonna see how much facts I

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,730
can give you in ten minutes so let's see

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,720
how it goes so if you've been building

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:23,269
websites for a while you might have come

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,400
to a point where you have to you know

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:30,919
show plans away which is pepper English

00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,440
we they badges are too low and it's an

00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,770
awesome position to be in because you

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,460
know you've reached a point where you

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,950
found your words and you know you can't

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,990
you know you can't spend that on clients

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,790
for flow and budgets but if you're like

00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,200
me it doesn't just doesn't feel right

00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,390
showing these clients away and

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,760
especially in terms where all your

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,990
inquiries are from lower budget clients

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,240
then it it becomes y-you need to find a

00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,840
way to to handle this so this is what

00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:11,750
made me explore these new ways of

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,420
working with clients so we're going to

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,090
cover three things so a website in a

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:21,619
week or a day or you know any limited

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,189
time a was or a turnkey system and then

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:29,960
also with website training or DIY style

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:32,749
systems so the idea of the website in a

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,329
week is that you build a site in a

00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:39,020
focused time so it that can be anything

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,609
like we have one day waves where we have

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,619
you can do it in three days or you can

00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:46,340
do it in a week so I do it in one week

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,590
and the idea behind it is that that you

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,310
work with one client or at least give

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:55,520
the illusion of working with one client

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,590
dedicated so so like I said it's a

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,100
builder website in a short focused

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,109
amount of time and then what's essential

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,740
for these styles of services is that

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:08,539
there's communication and they and that

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,700
preparation is essential so you need

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,140
everything before the week or the day

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,830
can start so you need

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,990
- like in my case we do a discovery

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,360
session and then we figure out do they

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,050
need logos do they need copy written by

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,310
a copywriter did I need photos and

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,280
everything then needs to be done the day

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,290
before we start I've actually I haven't

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,530
implemented it but I what I was thinking

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,690
of is to let them not pay like a 50%

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,120
deposit but they seem paid 30% and then

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,880
30% the day their hand in everything and

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,239
booking up so that they know ok now I'm

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,820
committed to that time ok and then the

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,860
next thing is and that's also very

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,010
important for these you have to have a

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,110
standard tech stack and normally you use

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,260
like a boulder like elemento or beaver

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,880
builder and then the last thing is and

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:05,030
also your process needs to be

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,920
standardized and productize so this is

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,690
just an example don't know if you can

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,850
see but this is my process in a sauna

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,010
it's got the different days from day one

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,690
to day five and then on every day we

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,860
know exactly what we're going to do to

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,530
get it finished by the Friday

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,049
okay so advantages of a website in a

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,299
week so you can get booked out weeks or

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,860
months ahead because you know there's a

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,170
dedicated time on your calendar the

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,739
client pays the deposit and he gets it

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,079
booked in you can you get all your

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,690
content that you need before you even

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,610
start and I know a lot of you that know

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,100
this is a big thing to actually get

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,329
everything before you start it's a lot

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,340
quicker to develop because you're

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,360
focusing on one client at a time and

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,209
you're also using a builder using a base

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,870
tech stack and then it's a collaborative

00:03:53,209 --> 00:04:00,230
process so I invite my clients to their

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,209
sonar project and I they give feedback

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,680
at certain times but it's still laid by

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,519
me so that's very important that it's

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,959
collaborative pilot but laid by you and

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,359
clans always know what to expect again

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,980
because there's a place a project

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,230
manager oh it's all they're invited to

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,930
the project I know what happens every

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,599
day you get paid on time because it's

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,120
deposit and then you let them pay that

00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,620
Friday before you go live and then

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,160
client respects your time and that's a

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,800
big one

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,750
that it's like a bonus because they know

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,330
they're only working with you that week

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:37,220
they don't come back with revisions and

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,810
keep on going for like months after okay

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,780
the next thing I'm going to talk about

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,730
is the website as a service or a wuss or

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:49,610
a turnkey system okay so the ply is the

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,780
same model as a software-as-a-service

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,510
but with website delivery so you use its

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,270
using WordPress multi-site to deliver a

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,970
turnkey website and that's well a

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,340
turnkey website network and everything

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,550
is fully automated so unborn is

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,090
automated I just the whole process I'll

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,910
talk about it a little bit later I think

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,200
okay so you need to both the perfect

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,720
website template for a specific niche

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,780
market and that's very important when

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,270
you focus on was--or turnkey systems

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,430
that you focus on a niche otherwise

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,960
you'll come compete with things like

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,360
Squarespace and weeks where it's just

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,550
all over the place your your templates

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,860
your what you offer them needs to be

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,190
focused on my case I'm focusing on the

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,840
photography market so it's a lower lower

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,580
priced photography and website and the

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,500
templates will be focused on them and

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,320
also the in the tick stack will be it

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,150
will be a standardized take stack again

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,570
and the same plugins on all the sides

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,090
otherwise you maintaining a multi-site

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,770
would become a nightmare and then

00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,660
automating the delivery the

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,230
customization and the maintenance so

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,500
everything needs to be automated and

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:09,740
like the I use WP ultima for that so for

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,040
the unloading memberships and also and

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,770
then manage WP for the maintenance I

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,320
think then it becomes something that you

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,490
can sell over and over and again

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,740
attractive price it's a monthly

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,660
recurring thing so it's similar to the

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,030
other services like that but it's

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,560
focused on a niche market and you can

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:33,169
scale to infinity okay this is just a

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,450
quick run-through of the chunky take

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,340
stack so you've got your hosting it

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,330
needs to be anything I'm using cloud

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,740
waste anything that

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:44,659
multi-site compatible and allows for

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,180
wild-caught domains and domain mapping

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,819
and then your website platform will be

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,990
replaced multi-site the main mapping

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,819
that will be either plugging that

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,469
handles the domain mapping for you so

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,689
that client could have their own domain

00:06:54,469 --> 00:07:00,469
and don't have to have like the sub-site

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,509
or your domain backup security and

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:05,990
performance that can be either handled

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,900
by your hosting provider all plugins but

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,419
what's important here is that it it's a

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,990
very basic plugin that's white labeled

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:17,509
or that can be white level and also it's

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,750
multi-site compatible then your theme

00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:23,300
and that's based theme gin like Genesis

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,879
or the beaver theme in my case because I

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,289
used to be the Builder plug-in and then

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,360
you needed your dashboard

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,699
need to be customized because you want

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,490
it as clean as possible maybe with some

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:38,360
videos for them to run through but no

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,419
other WordPress you know too many things

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,090
that can distract them from what's what

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,560
they need to do and then use the facing

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,539
plugins that will be specific to your

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,750
niche so whatever in your niche might

00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,340
need again if it can be white labeled

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,159
that's the best and it needs to be

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,110
multi-site compatible and then at the

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,440
top your membership and site creation

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,560
and there are a few options but so far

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:08,599
we found that WP Ultimo is the best use

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:10,669
for that cool and then the last thing is

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,250
it's kind of like a combination of the

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,930
tube but with added things so this I'm

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,210
just going to run through a few options

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,190
that you can do so you can either do the

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,229
wonder in a web when there is and then

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,479
but have do it one-on-one so sit with

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,759
the client if if you ever want to do

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,080
that but don't sit with the client and

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,310
it's actually like it the are very

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,579
training thing plus there are people

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:38,089
that like to be set then online life

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,740
training I mean that with that they do

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,199
you like the turnkey system so you type

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,449
a like a monthly membership but then you

00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:46,579
run like a webinar running them through

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:49,270
it so it's easier for them to set it up

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,950
by themselves but through like a webinar

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,600
and you can also do that same concept

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,420
but in person so that's something that I

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,100
would maybe consider doing in person

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,320
workshops but we have the whole turnkey

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,550
so everything's the whole turnkey thing

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,279
is where it's automated

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,140
automatically set up WordPress the whole

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,630
membership thing is there but then just

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,750
running through the actual customization

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,700
of the site then that you can have like

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,040
the videos as a course so you don't need

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:20,320
to do that live but you can also have

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,670
webinars once a month yeah and then the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,550
setup and video courses this way you

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,589
actually set it up for them so you do up

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,649
you charge like a setup fee where you do

00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,380
the logos and do the whole font settings

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,050
and they can just customize like content

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,970
maybe and then like I said all of these

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,040
you can either use with your tents key

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,459
system or you can use it with one-off

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,760
sites and it can be monthly payments or

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:49,029
it can be a one-off payment and that's

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,290
it so there's my details and I love

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,420
talking about these kind of things so

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,340
yeah and I'll be part of the panel if

00:09:52,420 --> 00:10:01,179
there's any questions

00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:01,179
