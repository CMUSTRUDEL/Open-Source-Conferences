what one way you are approaching because

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,859
we're talking about different ways to

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,740
run a WordPress business one way that

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,400
you are approaching running your

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:17,160
WordPress based or fueled business

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,039
one way that you are approaching or what

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,689
you are using as you run your WordPress

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,920
base for us it's all about

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,890
sustainability and relationships so

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,949
that's why we focused on a on a monthly

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,120
fee as opposed to doing project based

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,329
stuff so we so I really like lifetime

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,129
value and and recurring revenue the

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,129
relationship was a handful of customers

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,789
yeah so we build a membership plug-in we

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,710
in the product space of WordPress we're

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,680
also releasing a theme soon so we're

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,039
going to tap into that market it's a lot

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,379
better than consulting of I found just a

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,090
personal preference in the products

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,330
place and I guess we'll chat about a

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,060
little bit more soon okay so my word is

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,729
fascinating and because I I like I'm

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,450
into creating that experience for the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,960
clients through a systemized system cool

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,710
yeah so we basically are moving towards

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,080
product as services to generate

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,950
recurring revenue and that's one of our

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,500
main pushes so that and that was like be

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,189
a foundation for our custom development

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,689
work that we do for clients so my phrase

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,700
I said in my talk but communication is

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:47,689
oxygen over communicated as much as

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:49,950
possible that's because of the customer

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,790
service levels are compromised

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,070
I don't think developers are good

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,189
communicators with human beings that is

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,100
maybe with hence my talk

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,590
and I think the the point you raised

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,020
about the money is is a critical one for

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,950
for clients because of those

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,489
expectations and and scope that scope

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,930
used to be clearly defined and sometimes

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,670
developers need to understand that even

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,220
the clients don't understand the breadth

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,290
and the scope of the scope if you

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,760
understand what I'm saying

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,700
specific question is how do you deal

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,260
with your your supply and demand of your

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,420
capacity interesting so I'm in a very

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,910
different situation to most I don't have

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,950
money to Friday available to me to work

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,049
on development work because of the

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,540
business I run with my wife so the

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,010
specific thing that I have done and it

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,030
was one of the items on the on the slide

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,769
but it wouldn't have made sense if you

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,930
didn't see it but I very specifically

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:52,370
niche down to what I offer

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,390
I don't do side bold I don't do

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,459
front-end development

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,239
I do plug-in and theme customizations

00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,910
and that's all I do

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,860
so if a project if I look at a project

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,840
if I look at a customer's description of

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,310
the project and I can see that it's

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,470
going to be anything longer than about

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,100
three days I don't do it because I know

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,579
that anything over three days is going

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,440
to require more focus from myself than

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,790
what I'm capable of giving the client I

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,579
need to be able to get it done within a

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,660
three day period which for me is a week

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,980
because by the time the weekend comes

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,410
around and then switching to the weekend

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,730
business and I can't then I'm getting to

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,319
that point now and I don't mean to

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,459
insult anybody who's older than me but

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,660
in him to that point now where I can't

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,889
remember what I was doing on the Friday

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,600
when it comes to the Monday because of

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,510
what's happened to me on the weekend so

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,639
my my recommendation to two freelancers

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,989
who are going to be dealing or anybody

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,489
who's dealing with me you know it's easy

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,620
when you're working for a company or for

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,910
an agency you're generally working with

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,160
either a project manager or one client

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,630
at a time when you're in the freelance

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,150
space and you're working with multiple

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,430
people my opinion the best thing to do

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,430
is to niche down and I would say for

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,400
yourself who is employing developers in

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,530
the freelancing capacity you might find

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,090
that the the way you can get the best

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,310
value out of those developers if you

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,160
hire them for niche projects or hire a

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,600
front don't hire a generalist hire a

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,009
front-end developer for your front end

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,090
work hire a back-end developer for your

00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,220
back-end work

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,989
hire somebody to manage your database so

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,340
that you get the best out of that person

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:25,410
for that part of the project that would

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:25,979
be my opinion okay so like I explained

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,490
in mine

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:32,970
I booked lands in so I even sometimes I

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,580
have to be clients in that commands you

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,110
you know it it will only be a like maybe

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,750
two three months later that I work with

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,169
him but I found that most of the times

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,940
that that's in any case a good time for

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,280
them to create the contents and to get

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,290
everything done so and then also that we

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,010
have that dedicated time spent it on

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:55,740
them and what John said I also work with

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,800
creatives and photographers mostly so

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,720
the sites are very similar and we know

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,490
that we can get it done in that in that

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,229
week it it doesn't always happen like

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,970
that there's always some things and

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,310
especially within days like shops and

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,260
membership sites that's extra but then

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,720
you then you plan for that and you know

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,419
you you book in more weeks yeah I think

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:21,169
the working in weeks or days or whatever

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:21,169
you prefer is a good way of doing that

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:31,710
[Music]

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:35,160
quality quality so we used to build

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:38,550
websites we kind of started off in the

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,500
like low barrier mark as soon as we

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,120
pushed up our prices when we were happy

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,430
with our quality of work the clientele

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,710
is totally different we find clients

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,960
that we're happy to pay like three times

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,760
the rate that we were charging wasn't

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,099
even making us jump through hoops like

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,289
that was super easy to work with we find

00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,960
the super cheap clients where you know

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:01,260
they wants to squeeze you for full like

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,570
that little bit of money so it just

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,680
raised your price gradually until you

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,750
get to the point where you're happy with

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,650
and then you'll see a different clients

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,360
all coming in and something that I think

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,840
is super important that a lot of people

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,310
don't do is to create there's different

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,250
names right but like an ideal client

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,349
profile or customer avatar whatever that

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,569
might whatever name you've heard if

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:27,530
you've heard that

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,539
but basically what you do is you you

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,080
kind of imagine your ideal client give

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,939
them a name agenda an age as much of it

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,319
like a demographic profile that you can

00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,180
and then you you use you then from there

00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,710
you say well where do these people hang

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,939
out like will they be on LinkedIn will

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,650
they be on Facebook will they be in

00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,930
Facebook groups what kind of magazines

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,280
would they read and you you build as

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,669
much as you can of like what that one

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,969
person would be like and then will your

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,520
if you're going to spend money on PPC or

00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:03,020
if you're gonna do SEO or whatever it is

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,590
whatever your content strategy is going

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,110
to be then you can take that profile and

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,810
you can target that to that ideal person

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,169
and so like what Andrew was saying right

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,550
raising your prices is a great thing but

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,580
now you've got this profile you can

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,050
decide well how what kind of money does

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,939
this person spend what kind of thing do

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,120
they expect and so for us in our

00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:30,139
business something that's important to

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,539
us for our ideal client is that they are

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,629
someone who runs a small business that's

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,129
successful but they're super busy so

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,900
they need an online presence they need

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,550
marketing done they're intelligent

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,810
enough to do it themselves they can

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,219
probably figure out how to do it

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,479
themselves but they're not interested

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,919
because they love their business and

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,229
they want to do what they do in their

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,210
business so they don't want to learn how

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,580
to do what we do so they see us as the

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,039
expert they're willing to pay for our

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,539
time because it saves them time right so

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:02,569
so we turn away people who are like semi

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,400
DIY kind of people who because what they

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,889
do then is they say well I could do it

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,539
myself and that devalues us because

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,659
they're well I can do it myself and save

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:13,550
the money or I can loans do it myself I

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,180
don't really need you when they actually

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,520
do okay so from my point of view you you

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,169
build an ideal client profile and then

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,710
you can target those people with your

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,589
advertising and your content lucky

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,479
organic your organic traffic content

00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,430
marketing and you can go hang out in the

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,260
Facebook groups that they're in you can

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,550
you can find them on LinkedIn that kind

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:42,320
of thing

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:45,560
I just want to add to the fact with

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,620
raising your prices how we've done it we

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,720
also did just normal web design for

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,220
years and we were also like coming in

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,570
cheap just to get the clients and then

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:59,870
living in that nightmare so but then we

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,550
started to raise our prices but we

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,580
couldn't just you know increase the

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,640
quotient expect everything to fall in

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,180
place what we did is we started writing

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,420
very detailed proposals and in the

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,000
proposal you you say you set your

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,910
timelines your expectations and you

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,850
position yourself like you said as more

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,400
of a consultant almost and in that way

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,860
you can increase your prices because

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,580
you're positioning yourself as a more

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,400
professional service so there's this

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,500
website called WP elevation that gives

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,960
you great tips on how to write very good

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:47,990
WordPress specific proposals WP

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:50,810
elevation I had one small thing to that

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,790
I don't think anybody here who works

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,750
with clients or is runs an agency or

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,450
whatever it doesn't know that

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,450
information but it's always about the

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,250
fear you know if I raise my prices I'm

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,310
gonna lose clients if I charge more

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,080
they're not gonna want to work with me

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,090
if you go online and you search for

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,190
those of you who do you know put in

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,780
Williamson here on San y'all's

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,840
development easy digital downloads

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,550
restrict Kuantan Pro they did a series

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,920
of price increases that were I think

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,180
either double or triple their original

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,540
pricing and they blogged about the

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,550
process and then lost clients but they

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,710
ended up earning more money and being

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,070
and were able to then give their current

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:33,110
clients were a better support so don't

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,000
be fearful of making a change if it has

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,560
to be incremental that's fine if you

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,330
want to go big and go hard that's also

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,190
fine but don't be fearful of making that

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,550
change to make a better life for

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,550
yourself

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,490
Brendon Burchard and Jeff Walker Jeff

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,740
Walker's the GAR from product launch

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,470
formula pls like to book the launched

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,200
remember short experts Academy and they

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,150
were both speak deeply into this contact

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,700
and they will say it starts with good

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,460
stuff make sure your stuff is good and

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,050
if when you've got good stuff then you

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,910
can raise your price and that makes me

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,700
think about what we were saying earlier

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,280
guys make make sure you you're creating

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,260
the business that you want and that you

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,090
will have fun with and that links to

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,560
what Shane what I heard you say is I

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,880
want to work with the people I want to

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,160
work with it'll be fun

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,100
and when we having that fun we do better

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,140
work and we get better reputation we get

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,400
better feedback we get customers that

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,810
cross the line that actually do the

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,430
stuff that we're offering the services

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,990
in the products there are really good

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,000
questions so then the natural

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,400
consequence of finding good better

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,170
quality customers and clients is that

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,750
your business grows so the question then

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,790
is how do you how do you guys where do

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,560
you go to find a good development

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,030
Network people that can that you can

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,100
outsource to that you can partner with

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:51,770
as you want to grow and scale your

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:55,790
business there different ways you can do

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,320
it in my experience and understanding so

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,430
so one of those is like something

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,220
Jonathan mentioned when you were

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,630
speaking which is like a service that

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,910
he's a part of but there's other ones

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:10,000
like up work or and it's hidden miss a

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:14,750
view we've we've used some developers

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,450
and designers from from up work and so

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,010
like in the beginning what I would do is

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,490
I would pick two people give them the

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,350
same job see how they do and then you've

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,140
got to pay double for that work but you

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,710
get to sort of figure out you know who

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,360
like works the way that you want to and

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,340
so there's that you can find freelancers

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,200
online they are there are those ways but

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,590
other ways and that I was discussing

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,650
with some guys yesterday actually let's

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,620
say I build websites and I want to offer

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,330
my clients marketing services but I'm

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,850
not obscured enough and I don't have the

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:55,850
time there's a marketing agency you can

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,660
work together and a nice way that some

00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,759
people are willing to

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,490
you can what label one another services

00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:04,009
right so they there would be a marketing

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,139
company but the client will be on your

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,850
books they will do the work

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,730
they'll white label it for you so it

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,329
still remains your client and then they

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,939
could either give you like a percentage

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,740
of whatever they make or they

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:20,629
reciprocate by sending you the kind of

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,850
work that they don't do but you do okay

00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:28,610
so that's that's another idea and then

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,889
also places like this like weird camp is

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,199
like a perfect place to so try and speak

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:36,350
to as many people as possible so I found

00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,899
Jonathan had a weird camp many years ago

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,810
and if I need like serious hardcore

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,720
development he's my guy and the same and

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,300
the other thing is WP elevation so if

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,120
you actually become part of the

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,850
community and you do the cause you leave

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,649
you there are a lot of people and there

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,970
are they do things the same way as you

00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:59,180
do it because you all do the same

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,759
process and so I met a girl Mariah

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,069
she was also from Pretoria and now she

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,839
we do things together she's moving to

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:07,759
the design and I'm going to the bolt and

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:14,060
it works perfectly because we've got

00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:15,259
that same same way of doing things I can

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,550
always say stuff but as from a session

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,050
what what engine said about the

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,490
community get involved in the community

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,019
get to know the people in the community

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,410
build those relationships with the other

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:26,180
people in the community I have made just

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,709
because I'm involved in you know the

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,360
WordPress kept on community and I come

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,540
and visit Joburg whenever I can

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,819
just forward camp and I'm involved in

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,290
the slack I meet so many people with so

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,870
many different skill levels that I can

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,059
buy you know danwon I need some front

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,319
end answers or I can back Andrew and I

00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,689
need some plugin answers that I don't

00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:48,470
know whatever and the key thing there is

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:50,059
to be involved don't join the slack and

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,930
then go hey guys I'm so-and-so from

00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,639
Surrey and I'm looking for developers

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,410
and then never say another thing again

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,509
because then you become part of the

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,519
noise again so I'm not saying spend

00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,259
every hour of every minute of every hour

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,550
but log on every now and then and say hi

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:03,050
and see what conversation is happening

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,009
and you know communicate with us and get

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,560
to know us because we're a friendly

00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,760
Bunch

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,990
if this is your first time at a work

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,400
camp you've probably found us all to be

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,779
amazingly friendly and open and chatty

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,480
and that's who we are that's kind of how

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,370
WordPress is what it is so get involved

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,540
because when you get involved in the

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,060
community you meet all these people of

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,770
different skill levels you can then find

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,990
out who they know and who they know we

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,820
may though your network just my network

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,730
since joining the local community in

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:43,240
Cape Town has expanded like tenfold so

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:45,160
get involved in those communities I

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,260
think it's important to use tools

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,260
available like project management tools

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,540
like a sauna was mentioned earlier and

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,360
you also mention that I think tools like

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,920
a sauna or your own internal tools and

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,790
even stuff like Google Docs can be

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,510
really useful and like Jonathan said

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,100
over-communicate almost internally and

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,290
but it's never gonna go perfectly you

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,580
just need to keep keep communicating and

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:16,620
keep at it and use the tools available

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:22,150
to track progress and track time and

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,070
track communication on specific tasks

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:28,780
and projects and stuff so that's what

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:32,920
that's my opinion yeah it's it's always

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,990
a struggle but it helps if if TMM is got

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,200
like a specific tools I do so with us

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:41,400
okay we've got the process and Mikey

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,930
does like a certain amount of the work a

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,760
specific side or the work and things

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,220
like that that there's specific roles

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,170
but it it does especially you when

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,390
there's more than one side and you know

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,390
when things yeah it becomes

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:05,390
yeah so what ancients said about

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,689
creating processes so kind of what I

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,030
found is doing this for like twelve

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,189
years a lot of the processes are like in

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,030
my brain they like a kind of muscle

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,650
memory and when when somebody like new

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,720
you're getting someone new to do

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,790
something they'll ask you and then

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,730
you'll so I'll either just do it myself

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,949
because it's quicker or I'll explain to

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,200
them how to do it and then re-explain or

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:33,650
something you know so what I realized is

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,230
if I can do a video recording like a

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,809
screen recording of that and keep it all

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,600
together in like a repository of srp

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:44,390
standard operating procedures and then I

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,690
give like anyone new access to that and

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,160
then it's like okay well if they ask me

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,230
how do I do the specific thing have you

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,230
gone and checked it's there is either

00:17:51,230 --> 00:18:00,260
screenshots or there's video recording

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,340
or something like that so I'm gonna

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,320
answer this question slightly

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,790
differently because I don't currently

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,730
work in an environment where I manage

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,080
people I want to I want to eventually

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,250
get to that point where I'm managing a

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
team of some kind but I had the

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,630
advantage or the privilege at least

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,500
should I say of managing the WordCamp

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,340
kept on organizing team this year and

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,440
one of the biggest things that I

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,120
discovered through that process is that

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,650
and I noticed about myself I'm a

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,260
terrible manager I'm a micromanager of

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,580
note and if it's not being done I'm

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,840
gonna get stuck in trying to hurt myself

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,290
and then that means I'm doing everything

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,900
and that's not ideal so this year I took

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,520
a step back and I we we organized teams

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,230
within the team and we organized team

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,809
leads of people that I knew that I could

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,190
trust and then I just trusted them to do

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,890
it I trusted them to do what I know they

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,870
can do and I understood that if things

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,370
did go wrong I would at least be in a

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,070
situation where I could step in on that

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,450
team if I needed to and obviously it

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,770
takes some time to build that trust I

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,120
had the advantage of that most of them

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,080
were on the team last year when I was

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,020
running around doing almost everything

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,940
but those that did what they did well I

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,020
didn't put them as team need positions

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,419
and in the different teams and that

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,890
worked really really well so my my

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,429
situation would be to find people who

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,499
you

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,729
work on that trust and you get them to

00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:12,679
that point of trust and then just trust

00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:14,479
them to do what they do but then again

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,479
communicate you know we had a situation

00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:20,330
this year where the lack of

00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:21,889
communication was a key warning sign to

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,289
me that one of the team leader wasn't

00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:25,519
managing and so I contacted him and I

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,529
discovered that he was having some

00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,960
family related problems that was

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,549
impacting his time and it was a very

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,049
delicate situation because I can't just

00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,460
walk in and say look I'm gonna take over

00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,019
or whatever the case may be so I had to

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,159
kind of get him to make the decision to

00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,179
say I'm gonna step back can you get

00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,259
someone else to take over and that's

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,879
worked out well so being able to to

00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,469
manage that kind of scenario is not

00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,450
something that's easy but you know if

00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:49,309
you have people that you trust in other

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:56,739
areas then you can just deal with the

00:19:49,309 --> 00:20:01,909
fires that come up you know we use the

00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:06,589
website address www.h which stands for

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:07,099
who does what where and when and how are

00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:10,789
they doing that

00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:13,609
so asana is a gift I run my life for

00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:16,669
asana and Evernote literally my thinking

00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,679
laughs as well but it can get we can

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,749
lose traction of the granular specifics

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,179
so some of you have mentioned specifics

00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:26,299
so one thing I've learned to do myself

00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,869
is to to get good at what it is when I'm

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:32,479
saying have you done it what is it and

00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:34,879
who what where and how specifically as

00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:39,190
granular as you can to get it and that

00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:39,190
