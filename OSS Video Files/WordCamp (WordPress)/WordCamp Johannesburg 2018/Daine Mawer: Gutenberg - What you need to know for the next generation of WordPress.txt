Title: Daine Mawer: Gutenberg - What you need to know for the next generation of WordPress
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	As we move closer to the next major release of WordPress, the more anticipation grows around the impact Gutenberg will have on past, current and future WordPress sites. Not only will this revolutionary change effect the overall experience of WordPress as a platform, but it will also open a wave of questions, challenges and hurdles for WordPress developers, business owners and end users. In this talk, I will give you the low down of everything you need to know to prepare for the release of Gutenberg in WordPress core. Everything from how Gutenberg will change your business model, what WordPress developers need to know in terms of technical skills to keep up to date, and how it will dramatically change how we think and deliver content through WordPress

right so just a little bit about me I

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,840
somehow managed to choose a talk topic

00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:12,420
that were about Gutenberg and I've got

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,040
30 minutes to talk about it in and I

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,680
probably need about two and a half hours

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,999
so I wants to leave some time for

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,419
questions because it's quite a

00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:24,390
controversial topic so I'm gonna try and

00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:26,759
get through it in an even pace um if you

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,009
guys have got questions I'm not a big

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,659
fan of this super formal talk or

00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,910
anything like that so just put up your

00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:37,680
hand I'll answer it if I think it's

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,840
relevant and then carry on so I'm a

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,510
front-end engineer at 10 up is anyone

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,100
heard of 10 up before that's good to

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,110
know

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,680
it's a synapse or remote agency based in

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,270
the United States they are big big leads

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,460
and contributors to the WordPress

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,550
community they work on a lot of big

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,230
international clients across the world

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,510
I'll do a marketing pitch in this

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,370
presentation as well just so in case I

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,360
need to find some talent in this room to

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,550
bring back to them because that's

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:12,030
generally what my mandate is so we big

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,680
WordPress guys big on react and we hire

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,360
people from all over the world or

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,460
different disciplines from UX and

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,990
software engineering and obviously all

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,950
of our projects work on WordPress and

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,840
considering that we contribute so much

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,540
to WordPress core we've got about seven

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,640
guys working it enough that are active

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,330
core contributors a couple of guys

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,640
between leads and core releases of

00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,770
WordPress so we really do know what

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,659
we're talking about when it comes to the

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,860
internal workings of WordPress and how

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,619
it works and obviously with the latest

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,320
debacles of Guttenberg we've been

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,979
trialing and that's on certain projects

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,240
and we've we think we've come to a good

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,159
point it really started rolling it out

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,030
on some pretty big international brands

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:05,189
so today is sort of crash course for you

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:09,420
guys to start getting to know a what is

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,550
Gutenberg be why to use Gutenberg and

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,220
then what impact is going to have on

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,490
business owners here what impact is

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,310
going to

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,350
have an engineering and then the future

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,350
future which might scare the out of

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,600
everyone so on leaving that so lost and

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,740
then any questions so I generally like

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,010
to do a little bit of market research

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:34,920
before I go into all the details so who

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:37,110
is an engineer here developer I was

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,600
really hoping for more of you yeah

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,700
don't what does it say don't ask I'm

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,240
just that doesn't answer my question but

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:51,900
thank you and whose business owner okay

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,980
gonna make things interesting so who are

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,090
you obviously all heard of Gutenberg

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,190
right yeah it is

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,350
you know Trisha you're behind a white

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,700
column right now so I can gonna ignore

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,880
that comment completely mmm so okay

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,500
we've all heard of Gutenberg and I'm

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,640
going to explain to you guys a little

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,830
bit more about what it's about for those

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,120
of you don't know with the release of

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,460
five where it's 5.0 and there are some

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,550
major controversial conversations going

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,830
on in the community at the moment and

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm here today to give you guys a better

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,840
understanding and some knowledge to

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,430
equip me you that's going to help you

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,090
moving forward into the next few years

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:40,080
of WordPress and it's probably I haven't

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,000
probably not old enough to realize all

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,320
the inner workings of WordPress and what

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,720
happened right in the very beginning

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,440
when Matt and Mike started it up but and

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,420
I can tell you right now this is one of

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,210
the most controversial times in the

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,050
WordPress platform and on a majority of

00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,950
issues it's basically accessibility

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,760
internationalization live tasks I was

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,460
talking about and in Gutenberg so lots

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,200
to consider lots of decisions to make

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,690
and it's going to impact the engineers

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,400
and I it's probably going to have a bit

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,880
of a larger impact on the engineers in

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,950
this country and for business owners

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,030
there's an even bigger impact especially

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,840
when it comes to dealing with clients

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,760
and hard to actually move your

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,870
businesses forward on Gutenberg and what

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,540
to do with sites that you've already

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,710
built on classic WordPress and how to

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,640
get those sites across

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,150
Gutenberg so let's start with the first

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,420
one

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,970
so Gutenberg at the end of there is just

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:45,240
a replacement for the classic tiny MCE

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:47,190
Post editor that really horrible I don't

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,350
know what the word is rigid application

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,020
the wave race has been running since

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,770
version one there's been a ton of work

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,960
done over the years lots of good work

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,360
but as the web has developed and the

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,460
technologies have developed web fair

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,230
society while hey we need something

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,750
that's going to keep us in the loop

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,160
right we need something more modern we

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,060
need something that's going to be able

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,130
to keep our users on board especially

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,510
with the likes of vlogs like media more

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,880
blogging tech tools like medium

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,150
providing such cutting-edge user

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,460
experiences WordPress really had to jump

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,230
to the forefront of that and I think I'm

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,070
going to try and keep my opinions out of

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,740
this but I think they've done a really

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,720
good job so far - all the accessibility

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,250
issues so the first thing is experience

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,590
right this is not necessarily the

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,820
experience for engineers it's not an

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,980
experience for the people that are

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,870
reading your blog it's an experience for

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,300
the people who are writing content for

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,180
your blog does anyone do content editing

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,870
here how do you find WordPress in

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,270
general good bad I believe so it's good

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,370
Gutenberg's aim and goal is to make it

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,160
better right it's going to be more

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,590
dynamic more versatile and it's going to

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,630
help you put out easier better content

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,300
and improve your workflows alright so

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,600
that's the first thing to consider

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,400
second thing very very dynamic the way

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,900
that Gutenberg is built on a technology

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,590
called react who's heard of react that's

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,240
impressive

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,220
more people have heard of react and they

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,710
are engineers in here okay so building

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,860
real story both on react which allows

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,110
for incredibly fast process in times of

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,500
their content obviously more JavaScript

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,690
based now than PHP and fast JavaScript

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,060
not the old vanilla JavaScript and

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,540
backbone the tiny MCE has been employing

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,850
for the last 10 years or more so major

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,510
improvement there and then finally from

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,990
a publisher

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:48,090
point of view like I was saying earlier

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,850
here's a complete and utter overhaul

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,850
right so it's none of no short codes

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,070
anymore the content is going to be

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,080
dynamic you can be able to drag that

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,180
content around images can be dragged

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,100
around text blocks you're gonna have a

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,900
variety of different blocks that have

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,950
different purposes all right so that

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,360
could be code or video or tweets and as

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,800
most of you guys know especially the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,600
business owners when it comes to

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,580
extending WordPress and adding different

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,960
types of data or adding different types

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,820
of functionalities to the post editor

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,980
that's always been something that you

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,080
need in an engineer to do right you need

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,880
to hire a back-end guy you need to get

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,040
someone that understands or W options

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,840
works and our post meta works how to

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,850
I'll put that on the front end it's

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,800
always been a bit of a slip and weird

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,440
phrase to actually extend that part and

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,480
with Gutenberg now half of that stuff is

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,480
really baked into it alright so you

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,580
don't need someone to put content in

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,500
different columns anymore you can add as

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,930
much content you like it can be dynamic

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,510
it can update and that's obviously

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:55,380
helping always help by the power of

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,570
react so it's a major change and a major

00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,520
overhaul to WordPress and it's not like

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:04,220
anything that any of us in this room

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:10,350
right now is ever experienced okay so

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:12,360
the next part is to chat about so I

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,680
think I actually duplicated my slide and

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,130
forgot to change everything but I'll

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
just talk about this so why do you use

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,850
Gutenberg so let's let's talk a little

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,370
bit about the time period because that's

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,940
a really important discussion point

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,390
right now a lot with wafers five being

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,220
released and the whole debacle around

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,110
this is that Gutenberg is going to

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:39,510
become the default editor right what

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:42,150
does that mean for engineers a and your

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,090
business owners that means that as soon

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,040
as you update to where press five your

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,140
classic editor is going to be replaced a

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,850
ton of stuff might break which means

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,800
your entire website might break which

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,820
means you have a lot of unhappy clients

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,470
right so the very

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,180
dangerous part about this release of

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,610
Gutenberg what everyone's fighting about

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,710
now is either whether to actually go do

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,280
it or whether just to stick with good

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,380
old wordpress and tiny MCE right so for

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,750
businesses that are onboarding new

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,420
clients at the moment too soon for

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,700
Gutenberg right as a actually release it

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,200
and deploy it I would say especially you

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,650
will talk about the block API and

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,190
everything right now very exciting times

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:28,370
maybe not very stable times so I would I

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,710
would limit your time to live we can use

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,750
that don't start deploying sites with

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,580
with heavy Gutenberg development just

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,340
yet alright generally there's a couple

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,800
of minor releases that help fix things

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,720
there's the API documentation still

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,150
being released and updated constantly

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,940
so it's very very very new territory for

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,910
WordPress folk at the moment if you have

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,830
clients that are asking to be put onto

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,440
Gutenberg immediately

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,840
we've got pre-existing websites do it

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,500
with Kay and be very very very strategic

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,820
about it a lot has changed right the

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,820
block API using reacts as a JavaScript

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,920
interface for saving content content is

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,710
actually being saved through JavaScript

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,530
into the database now all right now that

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,480
might make absolutely no sense to the

00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:20,300
business owners here but for the

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,410
engineers that's a little bit to bend

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,360
your head around right we're used to

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,850
using PHP to save elements and data into

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,900
the database but Gutenberg you can

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,390
actually write the whole thing in

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,830
JavaScript and all of that content can

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,440
be saved straight into David based

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,200
tables there is a PHP API that goes with

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,890
that but for whatever reason you need to

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,620
use it there are different needs and it

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,940
would definitely make a big change to

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,880
how great and big is affecting your

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,790
slide so sum that up don't deploy

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,720
Guttenberg right now if when we're

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,210
pressed 5 does get released right be

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,860
very careful with it right if you have

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,800
clients that are asking for Guttenberg

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,890
it's going to be a process right a very

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,570
very strategic process of taking your

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,630
current data any data that's already

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,590
saved and post edit or post other

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,330
screens

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,760
and gradually transitioning that data

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,420
across to blocks which you will probably

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,520
have to build yourself right so big

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,529
things to take into account there from

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,590
an engineering point of view we had to

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,150
think about the skill sets required to

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,210
actually build Guttenberg block so for

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,070
the first time in WordPress I don't know

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,810
if some of you know but the actual

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,330
JavaScript framework that WordPress had

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,790
baked in for years now has been backbone

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,580
and you want her to backbone use

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,339
backbone templating right customizer

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,600
uses backbone nothing that you see on

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,430
the front end on the side we change

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,370
colors dynamically in titles and all of

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:53,350
that all written in backbone now are we

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,820
moving on something called react sorry

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,790
something called react brand-new

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,089
technology from face book complete shift

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,560
in paradigm in terms of programming

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,050
conventions we start dealing with things

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,930
like props and States and shadow Dom's

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,450
and all of that big scary words don't

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,839
make a lot of sense just yet especially

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,820
to new developers so if you are going to

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,000
move on to Gutenberg it's going to be a

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,950
case of making sure that whoever's

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,100
working for you in your business has a

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,420
thorough understanding of react your

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,920
back-end guys are going to be help

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,980
you're going to be able to help you with

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,660
the PHP side but the react side of

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,130
things is going to become very very very

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,050
apparent in the next two to three years

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,220
you're not going to be able to have and

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:42,170
you're not gonna be able to get guys to

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,420
build Guttenberg blocks that don't have

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,850
any experience in react all right so

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,860
what I'm trying to say to you is that as

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,990
a business owner you're gonna have to

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,380
start putting your feelers out now for

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,839
react experience vanilla JavaScript

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,600
experience and more so more Java scripts

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,390
experienced in PHP write big shift

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,630
whereas most web developers are

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,839
generally very very very PHP based

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,700
business so like I said your sourcing

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,890
provision engineers to build guttenberg

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,779
blocks is going to start becoming your

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,850
number one priority you're going to find

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,070
possibly the companies like visual

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,600
composer

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,980
sorry guys well I've heard of that I

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,570
can't remember what the other ones are

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,720
called

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,420
WP bakery be the Builder all of that if

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,670
Gutenberg goes the direction to which

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,440
way Forrester org is panting it to go

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,930
you'll start finding plugins like that

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,660
moving their business models across to

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,060
building Gutenberg blocks and not are

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,100
completely third-party solutions which

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,250
essentially they're kind of really given

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,370
you a Gutenberg just a I'm not going to

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,550
say the rest of that sentence yeah

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,920
so skills big thing client strategy even

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,360
bigger thing right you guys are going to

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,180
start getting faced now with either

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,500
clients requesting Gutenberg and you

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,140
might not be ready from a technical

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,310
point of view or you're going to get

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,580
maybe when Gutenberg gets a little bit

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,230
more stable and you feeling provisioning

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,260
skills you're going to get clients

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,810
saying now we don't want it right and

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,610
generally that now we don't want it it's

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,610
probably going to be based off of fear

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:25,270
of change it's a huge step for the

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:28,540
WordPress community to make so I would

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,700
handle that with care decide whether

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,590
your strategy aligns with going towards

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,450
something like Gutenberg it would I'd

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,100
base it off of decisions like what kind

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,650
of content you're publishing on your

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,330
website blogs makes a lot of sense it's

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,900
going to really change workflows of

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,120
content editors ecommerce has a place

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,930
for it right for posts and problems

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,610
sorry with products or there's all weird

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:55,810
in wonderful things you can do in the

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:59,200
e-commerce side with Gutenberg and just

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,730
be be more cynical than you would have

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,880
been in the past about building

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,430
solutions with Gutenberg okay and like I

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,020
said earlier there's going to be a big

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,190
content focus on on this so like the

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,810
invention of Gutenberg the

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,510
implementation of it in the

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,670
wordpress.org is going to be about

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,070
improving the workflow of the people

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,250
using that dashboard every single day

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,380
right it is going to help engineers move

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,860
into a different space and be more

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,770
modern and dynamic about the engineering

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,920
but definitely the biggest impact by far

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,720
is contents they are massive

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,949
discussions going on at the moment and

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,869
this is what I'm telling you guys just

00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:43,899
like hold back for a little bit in terms

00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:45,639
of accessibility on Gutenberg and it's

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,859
not the accessibility of the front end

00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,350
of your site which I could probably do

00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:52,869
another talk about that rot right after

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,970
this but it's about the accessibility of

00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,980
the Gutenberg editor itself right

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,799
keyboard shortcuts tabbing through

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,169
blocks being able to edit content

00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,459
without a mouse all of those topics are

00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,799
coming to light now which need to be

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:08,739
sorted out and then obviously like

00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,499
Pascal said big internationalization

00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:17,199
needs to happen there in order to get

00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:20,759
it's up to speed okay so in fact on

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:24,040
engineering so the front end like said

00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,499
major major major major upskilling

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,329
in JavaScript right you know

00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:32,019
technologies everyone should be familiar

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:37,509
with nodejs but right now vanilla

00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:39,009
JavaScript reacts the say the amount of

00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:41,589
I wouldn't say the learning curve is

00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:44,049
particularly difficult but it's

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,959
definitely a paradigm shift and it's

00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:49,779
going to take engineers a bit of time to

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,809
get used to building out blocks in a way

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,459
that's aligned with paradigms that work

00:16:52,809 --> 00:17:01,779
for us to set out for this next

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:04,389
generation content like I said blocks in

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:08,919
general can be static or dynamic so you

00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:11,019
can just have a block there that is a

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,019
paragraph tag that you can edit or you

00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:16,089
can add a class to or it can be a tweets

00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:18,399
or it could be like something like a

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,529
post selector or it uses the WP API to

00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:23,470
pull in posts into that block and show

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:25,089
links or show preview images blocks at

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,760
this point in this juncture and

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,649
WordPress can almost do anything you

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,500
want anything that's that react is

00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:37,000
capable of so that's using States and

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,039
updating certain elements in a very

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,440
optimized way these blocks will be

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,570
capable of so the user experiences that

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,760
you end up building with Gutenberg

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,640
are going to actually start becoming the

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,190
pivotal point of what you saw to clients

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,220
and how engineers are building that if

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,980
you can go to a client and say here's 50

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,360
blocks the rest is up to you they're all

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,160
going to work we're going to lay out in

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
your content we've thought about the

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,190
edge cases we thought about what data

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,050
you're going to be wanting to put on

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,660
that page we've thought about how it's

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,490
going to update go have fun

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,880
right I don't know if it means

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,850
increasing your prices or doing work

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:23,080
once often maintaining it but definitely

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:25,630
a dramatic impact there and then the

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,930
back end do you know what changes for

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,880
the back end nothing all right

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,670
front end seems to change too quickly

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,270
these days the back end seems to stay

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:40,540
relatively static so the PHP API for

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,090
Gutenberg is not at all difficult or

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,710
problematic it's just a couple of

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,520
functions and appending some scripts and

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,960
that's where your life right I'd say the

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,000
only consideration from the back end

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,690
point of view is if you do decide to use

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,350
the Gutenberg API and bold blocks art in

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,450
JavaScript you've got to be very careful

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,910
when using PHP actually have to kind of

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,630
like duplicate that functionality so for

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:11,350
instance if you build a block that

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:13,330
allows you to add an alert for instance

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,370
a static alert to your page for whatever

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,140
that I mean an actual like green or red

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,710
alert not the JavaScript alert that's

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,170
part of the browser if you build that in

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,740
JavaScript you would have to replicate

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:29,470
the same functionality in PHP which so

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,210
the same content same HTML structure all

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,500
of that otherwise react there's errors

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,600
it looks at what's currently being

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,940
edited in the post editor what's going

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,400
to be saved and then it breaks and has a

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,800
bit of a field day so what I'm trying to

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,950
tell you is either go JavaScript all the

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,840
way or do the JavaScript and PHP side of

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,280
things but be willing to rewrite the

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,920
same functionality that you've written

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,840
in JavaScript on the PHP side which

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,030
could get tricky and it's kind of like a

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,200
maintaining two code bases which I don't

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:03,190
think anyone really wants to do okay the

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,019
your future it's kind of funny because

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,690
freaking it's like Gutenberg the future

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:10,299
and in the future of Gutenberg but the

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,970
the big aim here is to move Gutenberg

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,590
out of the post editor okay

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,990
this is the part that should technically

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,360
scare the out of everyone yeah so

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,320
Gutenberg is going to expand well the

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,340
aim is for it to expand and themes

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,529
become a thing of the past

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,450
all right Gutenberg is going to get to

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:30,490
the point where you will be able to drop

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,169
a header the header of your slides in

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,200
there and control your navigation and

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:37,179
control your footer add a sidebar change

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,299
the layouts on a page template basis

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:43,299
it's going to take over that entire

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,399
ecosystem of WordPress and from a plugin

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:47,679
point of view as well it's going to

00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:49,740
start replacing functionality so before

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,279
is when you would need a plug-in to I

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,820
don't know a Facebook post within your

00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,679
content

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,850
Gutenberg's going to do that so you

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,730
should start seeing the WordPress

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,380
environment becoming cleaner from one

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,669
point of view with less need for plugins

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,580
because Gutenberg's already thought of

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:10,690
it but if we're moving into the future

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,010
things like the customizer will

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,620
disappear because there'll be no need

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,649
for it anymore Gutenberg will overhaul

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:21,760
that experience and provide it for you

00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:24,760
in a really elegant manner the really

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,950
cool thing about Gutenberg and they just

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,330
released the function as he I think it

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,460
was a couple of weeks ago as the ability

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,340
to nest blocks which is a technically

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,409
what all these fancy page folders allows

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,480
you to do which tiny MCE couldn't really

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:39,610
ever do so if you wanted to create a two

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,429
column layout and drop tweet and some

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,049
content on image and custom content

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:46,899
gutenberg a lot of that already so those

00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,389
kind of situations and scenarios are

00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:50,830
going to be possible by the time

00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:52,799
gutenberg is released and you can only

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,360
imagine with the open source community

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,460
the amount of blocks that you're going

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,309
to have we're going to see maybe quite

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,630
possibly see the plug-in repository

00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:05,740
moved to the side and a blocked

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,690
repository surface with any block you

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,600
could ever need right so we're going to

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,320
be there for you simple install accurate

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,870
install a plugin added

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Gutenberg save your content and your

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:22,669
works done right so really really really

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,740
massive change happening there and the

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,960
whole way that it's so dynamic is going

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,039
to make serious changes I would say

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,980
there's probably going to be a little

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,450
bit of implications on the back end

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,919
especially from a caching point of view

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,529
if you have such dynamic data running

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,480
through your posts and through themes as

00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:41,440
well so that's something that might need

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,509
to be considered in the long run but

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,210
definitely something to consider all

00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:50,450
right that and then obviously templates

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:55,429
so I think the functionality is

00:22:50,450 --> 00:23:00,500
currently in the API documentation right

00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:02,419
now there's no real way to you can

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,830
create a post right and just drop blocks

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,480
on there and save it and that will show

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,909
up when you're fronting but there's no

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,879
way to set out a predefined amount of

00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:13,129
blocks so if you guys think landing page

00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,480
wise like sort of like you get those

00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,669
landing page templates you can buy a

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,490
theme forest there are fantasy heroes

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:21,889
and sliding in components all of that

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,620
something like that will be capable in

00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:27,379
Gutenberg by the time it's released that

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,509
guy an engineer can come along set out a

00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:32,389
layout of predefined blocks you can edit

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:34,460
the content change the images save it on

00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:36,529
a page template and you've got a landing

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,549
page no stress no fuss

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:43,820
simple as that right and then now it's

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:47,029
time for my marketing pitch so if there

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:50,029
is anyone here I'm looking for new

00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:53,090
opportunities 10 apps remote team

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,950
there's about 170 of us everything from

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,100
back in engineers front-end engineers

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:01,340
your ex guys like they were really big

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,409
in the international community and big

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,269
big drive to find really talented

00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,769
engineers I've tried to push a few

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:09,080
people already since I've been here but

00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:13,340
it's not working I haven't given them

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,779
enough beer yet and if I could fight I

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,009
can always find the beer Jonathan so

00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,389
please do come speak to me if you want

00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,299
to know more about it like I said it's

00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:25,370
remote working and this is my first year

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,059
of remote work and

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,260
it's been wonderful the least I've

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,300
traveled around the world and worked in

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,530
different places and you don't really

00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,520
feel like you're living the rat race

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:39,970
anymore even like you kind of off so I

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,070
think that's me with two minutes left

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,690
there is a beta I believe that has been

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,420
released right now I'm actually doing a

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,450
workshop in with camp Cape Town next

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,550
week on building a Guttenberg block and

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,080
I do you plan on using WordPress five

00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:57,370
meter if you hear really horrible

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,370
results about it then don't upgrade

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,840
please sit down and have a cup of coffee

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:09,820
with great beer thank you

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,820
