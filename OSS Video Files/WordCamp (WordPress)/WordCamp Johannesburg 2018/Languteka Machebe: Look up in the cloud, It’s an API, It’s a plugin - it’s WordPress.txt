	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,779
my name is Londo

00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:11,429
I'm currently a c-sharp developer based

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:15,150
in PE which is soon to change as I'm

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,869
looking to move into professionally into

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,260
WordPress so my story today is it's

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,970
basically about two guys two types of

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:32,399
people which are WordPress people and

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:37,920
the rest this could be a group of up to

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:41,820
20 people who are in PE couple of months

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,610
ago and we were given a task to create a

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,160
balk SMS service like a customized one

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,579
for a certain entity because they wanted

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,739
to send out his missus to some clients

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,969
that have a spreadsheet and they wanted

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:00,890
to export it into the DBE and all of it

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:03,510
so there were a couple of requirements

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,880
sms's were growing up for twenty-two

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,560
cents and SMS I would name the service

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,840
that we were using but I'll happily give

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,350
it to you offline I just don't want to

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,869
promote any other I Tuesday so the

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,780
judging criteria for this little

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:23,030
competition that we had going there were

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,150
seven six portability of the app

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:31,590
security grid the graphical user

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:35,970
interface features innovation and ease

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:40,290
of use because we are at work and

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,009
obviously I used work but why did I use

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,009
WordPress

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,799
now this is sad because then you guys

00:01:50,969 --> 00:02:00,869
don't get to see some of the means that

00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:02,340
I've put out that's okay that's cool I

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,619
guess I'll have to tell you everything

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,590
like previously so the slag that I see

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:15,930
right now is a picture of a picture of

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:18,690
Superman but Superman is hence the title

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,090
of the talk is look up in the cloud it's

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,920
an API to plug in its workers you know

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,390
Superman awesome so the special story on

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
how to hack together a secure web

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,760
application with the power of WordPress

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,980
speeches plugins API the race API user

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:41,610
roles with a tight deadline at a

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:44,610
hackathon 24 hours so there are two

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,190
kinds of people WordPress and the ad the

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,670
rest we'll talk about both but will

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:58,170
mostly focus on the WordPress people the

00:02:50,670 --> 00:03:00,239
rest languages right so we're gonna

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,600
touch on the first topic which was

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,989
portability the ability of software to

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,200
be transferred from one machine or

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:13,139
system cool

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,690
so portability the ability to move to

00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,540
transfer the software from one machine

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:25,109
to another who has never installed

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:27,079
WordPress here who has was it easy there

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,150
we go that is the first thing I actually

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,220
loved about WordPress I installed it and

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,069
in less than five minutes my environment

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,859
was was ready it was it was our

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:41,519
localhost because you know still gonna

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:47,069
bring some started alright and I've got

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:50,510
a meme here of an old man the huge white

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:53,190
beard with a laptop on his lap and

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,960
there's a windows form that comes

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,010
and that says the wizard will now

00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,390
install your software who remembers that

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,760
cool at least we don't have to deal with

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,230
like those kinda quizzes with with

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,060
WordPress everything is like almost

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:12,030
instant second point which was security

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:15,950
security is defined as the state of

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:21,870
being free from danger of threat okay a

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:24,720
secure and I trust you all and the

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,720
reason why security remember security is

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,050
one of the telling features right you

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:56,610
already have a registration login form

00:04:31,050 --> 00:05:03,060
which is totally it's so cool so we have

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:12,900
23 minutes 55 23 hours 55 minutes left

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:17,430
cool the GUI where you find your you

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,500
know post something add some media add

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,360
pages you just take the other side and

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,820
it's got you a beautiful picture right

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:33,020
there on top posits and all that howdy

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:35,990
so that one of the fourth feature is

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,990
features which is a distinctive

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,390
attribute or aspect of sampling so once

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,780
there was Matt who was giving a talk

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,669
about poopy fiying WordPress using

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,650
WordPress

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:53,479
object-oriented standard and these

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,770
features were one one of the things they

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,379
spoke about you know if you have an

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,169
object it inherits from the other and

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:02,029
end up having other features that you

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:04,159
can use so that is the best thing about

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,580
using WordPress immediately when you

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:09,069
install WordPress and you're going to be

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,719
extending on it you have all the

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:16,610
benefits of WordPress which are

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:19,189
currently their posts security user

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,490
roles which we going to come in on it

00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:26,870
now

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:29,360
one of the features I used was adding a

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,569
new role into WordPress we've got a

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,680
couple of roles in WordPress contributor

00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:42,379
author administrator editor subscriber

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:45,830
am I missing one yeah but we wanted a

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,990
special we wanted a special kind of role

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,349
where we could actually manage whether

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,569
someone is a large cinema service and if

00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,629
someone is really just read their

00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:59,000
services now it goes back to security

00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,580
you don't want someone we just got into

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,620
him he was not to be able to read sms's

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,810
on the on the portal but you don't want

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,740
them to send out messages because there

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:13,669
were enough sending messages with the

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:20,750
whole company to distribute and we used

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:22,250
them because this was our our little

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,800
portal which was there and it was

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,789
communicating with another SMS service

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,419
so you know we had to transport that and

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:35,419
get feedback show it back to the user so

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,479
we use that to show that the amount of

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:42,020
esta misses you have left and sending

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,740
sending basically we did not use any we

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,080
did not do any hard hard back-end stuff

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,240
where you know you need to communicate

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,289
with this gateway and so and so it was

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,449
just API is all the way innovation the

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:59,210
act of the action of

00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:02,539
says the the action of the action or

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:08,539
process of innovating is becoming back

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:11,900
to so if we look at WordPress starting

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,059
off in geni 2003 it got a picture here

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,159
of it of the first theme of WordPress

00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:20,870
before the whole themes came in plugins

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,469
and all of that and if you look at

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,569
weights actually when starting from 2003

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:30,680
to 2018 I mean right now we even have

00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:34,690
the REST API which is works out of the

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,690
box right there you just need to

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,169
[Music]

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,419
[Music]

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,110
so literally gives us time to

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,860
