Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	Going to the office at 9 and coming back at 5 daily is not my cup of tea. Also, I am a student so I canâ€™t afford to miss my classes on a daily basis. So what I do is that I work remotely with companies.
In my walk-through, I will be covering topics like How we communicate in remote companies, what tools we use, the joy of working at your own ease. I would also love to include how I travel around the globe and work remotely.
Through my walk-through, I want to help people to connect to remote companies and earn without sacrificing whatever they are doing full time.
