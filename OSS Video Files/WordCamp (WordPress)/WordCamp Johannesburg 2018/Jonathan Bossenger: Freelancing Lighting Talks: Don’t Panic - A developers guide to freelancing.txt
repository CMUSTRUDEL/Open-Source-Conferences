Title: Jonathan Bossenger: Freelancing Lighting Talks: Don’t Panic - A developers guide to freelancing
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	As the world becomes more interconnected, there are multple opportunities for freelance developers. You may be thinking that striking out on your own is easy. The truth is that there are a number of factors to be aware of, and the modern freelance developer needs to be prepared in order to succeed.
Starting 2016 I left the world of employment to become a full time freelancer. I was fortunate in I had another source of income, but as a husband and father of two, with all the usual bills to pay, I was not prepared for the effect working for myself would have on my mental state, my health or my family.
Towards the end of 2016 I joined Codeable, a freelancing platform for WordPress. Where Codeable was different from all other platforms was that it held quality and customer service/communication as the most important factors of freelance development. Since joining Codeable I was able to turn my work situation around such that I now earn 3x as much as I did when I left employment and I am in the favourable position of being able to turn work away.
While Codeable had a big part in bringing me leads to quality work, it was the lessons I’ve learned since joining Codeable about being a successfull freelancer that are the focus of this topic. Being a part of the Codeable community means I have learned so much from other experienced freelancers about things like work/life balance, how to communicate with clients pre hire, how to prevent scope creep and how to manage time and projects on my own.
My talk will be split into two parts, The first will be around the 1st year of my time as a freelancer, scrounging for whatever work came my way because I wasnt in a position to say no, essentially all the things I was doing wrong. The second will be around my second year, when I learned from Codeable, and other Codeable developers, and how these lessons lead me to where I am today.

Hey

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,700
so when I walked up here I factored in

00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,200
time to get my laptop plugged in and

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,249
switched on and picked it up and

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
everything I didn't factor in time of

00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:15,259
how long it's gonna take to get this mic

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,580
on so I'm running a bit behind but while

00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,800
my laptop's tweeting up and I get the

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,300
slides going the stalk is aimed at

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,760
freelancers but it's not freelancer

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,930
specific so if you are a freelancer I

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,010
think you can benefit from this if

00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,330
you're thinking about becoming a

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,830
freelancer I think you can benefit from

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,840
this but there are some things that you

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,480
could benefit from even if you work for

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,629
an agency or you work remotely this is

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,309
not specifically freelancer content I

00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,019
just happen to be a freelancer and I

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,129
believe you talk about what you know my

00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:43,519
slide is titled don't panic a

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,989
developer's guide to freelancing but the

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,420
talk is not about not panicking I just

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,329
like Douglas Adams books and and movies

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,769
so stolen that straight out of

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,870
Hitchhiker's Guide a little background

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,149
about myself I've been an open source

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,699
developer for about 15 years now I'm a

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,769
husband and father of two I'm a business

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,539
Kona co-owner with my wife and a

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,309
freelance developer at the same time I'm

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,170
also a cook WordPress community deputy

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,090
meetup organizer and WordCamp organizer

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,340
and you can find me online at Jonathan

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,430
boston.com or Twitter John underscore

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,100
Basinger I'd like to start with a little

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,159
bit of admission I hate the word

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,750
freelancer I hate it and the reason I

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,570
hated is because whenever I meet a new

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,850
client they usually tell me about the

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,070
previous freelancer who didn't deliver

00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,780
the project on time or correctly or

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,359
didn't finish the project or was

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,430
unreliable or was unresponsive and had

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,899
to take the money and run attitude okay

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,689
some of you are smiling about that

00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,890
because you get it right these slides

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,969
will be online so you can see them later

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,549
there's nothing really special there

00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:45,229
it's just my notes really and we always

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,850
have sort of the the angry client

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,530
situation and the client is the problem

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,030
in the client whenever you talk to these

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,049
freelancers that took the money and run

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,729
it's always though the client was this

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,380
and the client was a scope creeper and

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,579
the client was unresponsive and the

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,210
client didn't give you the information I

00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:01,369
need I'm gonna make a statement which is

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,789
my opinion but might be a bit too

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,689
worried about it

00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:08,179
might be a bit controversial I believe

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,819
they are no such things as bad clients

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,110
only bad freelancers who don't manage

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,650
their clients specific expectations

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,700
okay so let's talk about a timeline of

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,370
my bad clients

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,980
I left agency work at the end of 2015 I

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,760
started working as a freelancer it's not

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,390
that's not kind of workers it's

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,770
appointed by July 2016 I was burnt out

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,960
and ready to give up on this whole

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,490
freelancing thing okay and I actually

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,870
wrote a blog post on it you can go onto

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,240
my website and you can google you can

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,370
search on my website remembering why and

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,600
it was the day after I had been up

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,110
working until 2:00 in the morning

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,700
killing myself to get something done

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,200
because I had failed not because the

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,850
clients had failed and that's when I

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,340
realized that I had this Epiphany

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,630
in September 26th I joined the company

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,700
called codable they're in there a

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,800
European based country a freelancer

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,270
platform where they bring in clients and

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
you work with those clients they're

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,180
similar to freelancer and upwork and I

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,830
say similar they're not the same and the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,530
reason they're not the same is because

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,840
they teach they're what we call experts

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,920
not about how to write code not about

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,940
how to build products because if you're

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,680
an expert you wouldn't know how to do

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,530
those things they teach their experts

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,570
how to work with clients and since

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,810
joining credible in September 2016 and

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,940
kid you not I have doubled my earning

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,630
potential because I now know how to work

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,160
with clients better so I realize that

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,040
the clients were not the problem I was

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,540
the problem the three thing the three

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,459
keys to success I learned from credible

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,230
key number one money key number two

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,780
quality key number three customer

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,000
service now those sound obvious they

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,920
really do but the problem is when you

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,180
get into a project what tends to happen

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,790
is that we forget about those things we

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,519
maybe focus a bit on the money we maybe

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,049
start focusing on quality and things go

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,130
wrong during a project and the reason

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,480
those things are wrong is because we

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,280
haven't got a plan so let's talk about

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,580
the getting paid part first talking

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,160
about the money this is this is a quote

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,150
from somebody who I i've strongly

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,620
believed in his name is jonathan

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,630
passenger and he said this in 2018 he

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,070
said the number one reason freelancers

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,600
burn themselves artist because they

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,160
don't charge enough okay and I believe

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,290
this is partly a South African thing I

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,120
think we have a tendency to not charge

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,340
enough because either we don't

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,750
understand what we're worth or we feel

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,000
like we need to charge this and the

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,300
other guy to get the project and you

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,770
don't as far as I'm concerned

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,420
all of these links are on my website but

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,040
they're not I'm not putting them up so

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,000
you come to my website if you find them

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,920
somewhere else that's fine but there's a

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
article on my website Jonathan Basinger

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,400
/ rates

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,380
where I got this amazing spreadsheet

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,210
from somebody who's also in this sort of

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,460
freelancing game and organizing how you

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,660
calculate up a little rate most of the

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,310
time when freelancers can't calculate

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,110
the billable rate they look at what sort

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,430
of average prices of people charging and

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,360
then they go well I want to get work so

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm going to come in just under that

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
they don't think about their living

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,050
costs and their laptop costs and their

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,730
internet costs and how much actual work

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,570
time they're going to get so that's a

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,820
good place to start but it's not a good

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,290
idea to charge by the hour it's a better

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,990
idea to charge by the value that you

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,240
give to that project so how much work is

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,980
this really okay

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,540
yesterday I was doing a workshop and

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,940
things went wrong even though I had

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,590
everything prepped up things went wrong

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,780
this is 15 years with the development

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,810
this is a truth folks there will be

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,490
something that either goes wrong or that

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,470
you don't know or that you didn't expect

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,910
I can guarantee it if you tell me you've

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,770
had a project that's never had that

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,650
happen it's another person I'm gonna

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,700
over beer today okay can anybody put up

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,260
a hand and say there's been a project

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,840
that's been perfect all the way through

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,280
nothing happen unexpected happen no it's

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,290
going to happen you need to plan for it

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,320
how complex is the problem that you're

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,390
solving for the client okay how urgent

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,190
is this to the clients how important is

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,470
this to them that that is more value

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,540
that you're adding to the situation to

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,610
give you an example codable estimates

00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,130
are calculated based on the total scope

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,680
to be completed the complexity of the

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,150
project and the urgency we don't when

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,890
our clients ask us what is your hourly

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,260
rate I don't give it to them

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,030
I have my hourly rate and I know how I

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,610
work it out for the project and my

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,820
hourly rate is my actual Ally rate plus

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,290
30 percent every single time and if it's

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,600
a difficult client and I'll talk about

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,280
difficult clients in a second if there's

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,510
red warning bells go off I add another

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,090
30% okay it's hard but I have to do it

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,530
because I have to plan ahead there's

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,760
another there's another estimation thing

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,040
that you can use it's called per test

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,710
emotional 3-point estimation if you go

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,000
on Wikipedia org and search three-point

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,100
estimation they talk about that and it's

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,630
basically you start with the first

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,920
hourly figure that you came up with

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,190
here that you know this is how long it's

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,290
gonna be right let your base value then

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,190
you go worst-case scenario everything

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,600
goes wrong what's the worst-case

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,520
scenario and usually I go three times

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,620
what my base value was then you go

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,150
perfect nothing's gonna go wrong

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,950
and that's usually about half of my face

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,570
value you take all of those three and

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,630
then you calculate an estimate all right

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:04,110
that's one way of doing it from the from

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,060
the CEO of codable he used to run an

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,370
agency his way of doing he takes

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,790
whatever estimate of time the developers

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:15,210
give him and he multiplies it by PI and

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,730
he said every single time he was closer

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,900
than the developer okay it might not

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,260
work it's a win - it freaks out with

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,820
projectors and things so that's money

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,460
let's talk about a commitment to quality

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,110
right it is important that you think

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,050
about the time that you're going to need

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,040
to write and make quality work if you

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,690
could if you're doing test-driven

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,550
development that's going to take time if

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,880
you're doing tasting that who here

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,530
estimates for testing time like I can

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
count those the hands on my at one hand

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,010
if you're not estimating for testing

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,060
time you're gonna lose up okay so you

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,210
need to make sure that you're including

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,730
that time in your project okay thank you

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,460
three minutes so basically it boils down

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,020
to a failure to plan things like finding

00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,310
your niche don't take projects that are

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,630
so far out of your scope you're not

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,800
going to manage them because that's

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,100
going to take even longer and you're

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,780
losing out have a project scope we're

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,540
cut with a client what they requirements

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,740
are get it nailed down so that when they

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,090
complain and say you didn't do this you

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,140
can go here's the document this is the

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,810
document that I agree to you for this

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,520
amount of money okay I spoke about the

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,320
PI factor and estimates earlier sweet

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,960
the small stuff how many of you estimate

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,990
for time to email back and forth even

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,250
less that takes time that that cuts into

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,950
how much time you have to develop

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,300
generally when we work arts develop in

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,710
time for a project we go this is going

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,479
to take me four hours to requite for

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,740
four hours you don't think about the two

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,890
hours of email back and forth you're

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,140
losing that time okay

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,880
then taste and I don't mean taste your

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,120
work I mean taste your plan of working

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,040
with clients measure go back after every

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
project and see how much time did I work

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,800
on this project how much time did I

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,800
spend communicating with his client

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,700
measure the project process not just the

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,210
work to get an understanding of the next

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,160
time you know what to look for now I'm

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,839
not knocking on customers okay for those

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,830
of you can't see my screenshot I don't

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,390
watch the show but I know who King

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,649
Joffrey is and I've got a nice picture

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,360
of King Joffrey and it says the customer

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,279
is the king the customer is still king I

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,740
still believe in that all right I do

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,720
believe in that so it is important to

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,070
build a rapport with your customer get

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,959
to know them a little bit communicate

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,080
with them understand what their needs

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,089
are right when you start building a

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,589
rapport what happens is you start seeing

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,120
some warning bells you start seeing how

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,220
they work with you what information they

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,980
give you how far they're willing to go

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,529
with you so that you can learn to say no

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,440
if it's the wrong project or the wrong

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,520
clients okay you can either say no or

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,480
you can increase your estimate because

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,279
you know they're going to be difficult

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,310
client I had had a situation recent

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:47,690
recently where I passed up on 130,000

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:50,180
ran project because the the person that

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,470
I was dealing with signed off not one

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,270
but two emails with abbreviation D F you

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,470
the D Stanford own to the you stand for

00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,750
up I'll let you guess what the F stood

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,100
for I'm not working with that client if

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,690
that's his attitude when we go in I'm

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,240
not working with that client I walked

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,339
away it's not worth it to me okay and

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,230
then finally if you follow automatic

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,370
you'll know that they have a saying

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,470
internally in the company the

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,390
communication is oxygen for distributed

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,339
for distributed teams I believe

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,930
communication is oxygen for freelance

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,130
and remote works so communicate with

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,390
your clients as much as you possibly can

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,390
now this slide goes back to you and I've

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,650
got the three - out one key to success I

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,450
learned from Kurt of all that customer

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,690
service takes time quality takes time

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,700
time equals money so make sure you are

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,650
estimating properly for all the time

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,470
you're going to spend and then everybody

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,779
will be happy when you charge according

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,010
to the project not according so when you

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,050
charge according to the project not

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,820
according to your skills

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,829
everybody wins I have never had a client

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,560
come back to me and say I love your work

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:53,660
but you charge too much I've never had

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,330
that happen okay thank you very much you

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,459
can ask me questions later

00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,459
