so thanks so much to the organizers for

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,250
having me here and thanks to Robyn for

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,319
that good introduction very nice to be

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,750
introduced by somebody of your caliber

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,750
and thank you to organizers for

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,849
including this topic in the set of talks

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,260
for the event because customer service

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,609
is something that is often left as a

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,800
back bonus I mean that you'll think that

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,029
you'll get you later but I want to try

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,470
and convince you that this is a key

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,880
element of your sales and of your

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,010
business set will help you to grow your

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,840
business so I guess if you look at what

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,730
we did like in the same yesterday you

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,320
guys focused on building your your

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,329
WordPress arts installing WooCommerce

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,070
then you've got your SEO up and running

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,870
there needed some Facebook Ads and all

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,219
of that everything that you're doing

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,420
there is with the intention of getting

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,640
people to your sites and getting sales

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,430
your return on investment from all that

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,860
entry of your return on investment from

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,140
your activity and your investment of

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,730
time the money is the return on

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,719
investments of the sale that you get

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,660
from the customer that comes to your

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,980
site which we know but if you do all of

00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,670
that activity and the customer comes to

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,250
us at once

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,270
and Bars that's great and that's your

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,710
return on investment but if that

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,339
customer comes back the second time and

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,049
bother you again

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,060
you've put in the same effort but your

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,260
return on investment doubled so this is

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,400
kind of like where I'm going where

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,200
customer service becomes really

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,640
important because of that person can

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,680
come back a third or fourth the fifth

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
time then that's when your company

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,200
starts to grow and I've seen a lot of

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,310
growth on the back of using that as

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,320
using it as a tactic that's not a good

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,210
word but to use it as part of your like

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,790
sales arsenal to use it as part of your

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,380
company as a strength then it can really

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,509
help you a lot to grow your business and

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,930
to grow your sales so Robins done a

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,840
really cool job at introducing me so a

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,210
bit of background about myself is I cut

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,490
my teeth in e-commerce in London in 2008

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,470
I joined a small startup company was

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,210
just exploded and I was one of the first

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,860
cars in and helped a lot with the the

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,930
growth of the company and I think I was

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,229
rewarding ours because in 2009 I was I

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,570
got the HSBC Award for London's young

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,170
business Person of the Year the 2009

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,030
seems like a long time ago were too long

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,890
but in 2010 I started action gear and

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,470
2015 as Robin said we took home the

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,459
award for the best e-commerce customer

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,459
service in so there

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,750
and that was a critical kind of

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,129
recognition like I was super proud of

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,140
that but it was a great critical

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,000
recognition from our team for the

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,260
emphasis that we always placed on

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,670
customer service and it helped us to

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,010
grow our business and helped us to grow

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,349
sales year-on-year to the point where

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,799
last year we were doing pretty much well

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:34,799
over 20 million bucks in a year and it's

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:36,090
the real interesting thing and you know

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,109
numbers on just numbers you don't know

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,400
what that really means but the real

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,319
interesting part about that kind of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,540
turnover and why I wanted to mention it

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,000
is that 37 percent of our sales from

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,260
last year was returning customers that's

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,720
seven and a half million around with the

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,609
sales then I might not have had if we

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,159
weren't offering the best customer

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,290
service right so this is kind of like

00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,730
why I emphasize customer service as

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,590
being a real key part of your business

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,239
because when customers come back and

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,319
shop with you again not only is a

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,510
cheaper for you to bring them back to

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,209
shop again it delivers like long-term

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,040
return to you and those people become

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,319
long-standing customers and that's

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,969
really what I want you to do so I want

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,049
to encourage you to do that so now I've

00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,519
started the install key ecommerce

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,720
Academy where I'm taking my experience

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,889
and knowledge and trying to share with

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,229
people who want to get into e-commerce

00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,449
so that they can learn how to start and

00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,799
grow their own online store and one of

00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,199
the topics that I love to teach about is

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,659
customer service so hopefully today I

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,180
will show you how to start or how to

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,500
offer good customer service not really

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,689
good customer service or actually

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,769
award-winning customer service so that's

00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,659
what we're going to do the five steps

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,180
that I can offer for you to be able to

00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,769
do this so step number one is to hire

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,699
the staff that already have the right

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,169
genes and what I mean by that is for

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,419
quite how did these slides last week

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,159
forgive me so offering great cost great

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,609
service is built into somebody's

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,870
personality so this is where a lot of

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,040
people get it wrong when you're when

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,169
you're hiring your customer service

00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,669
staff people take in somebody and try

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,040
and train them to be a person that can

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,989
offer good customer service but there's

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,269
a certain personality that lends itself

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,949
to offering good customer service and if

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,199
you just keep your eyes open you'll spot

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,639
them the the waiter at the restaurant

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,959
that gives you exceptional service it

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,280
just blows you away and you want to give

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,019
the guard double-tap because he's just

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,519
so good or the petrol lieutenant

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,349
deadlock really makes your day by being

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,349
friendly and like spontaneous and like

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:25,389
does it stretch to you help you art or

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:27,129
when you go to another shop

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,599
and the customer service person there is

00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,590
really good perhaps you go to a

00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,090
competitor and some of you there's

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,800
really good so if you just keep your

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,999
eyes open you'll see them like for

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,830
instance a guy who's maintaining the

00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,419
cappuccino machine outside he's such a

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,919
nice guy had such a good conversation

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,129
with him and if I was looking for

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,409
somebody odd maybe go hunt him so one

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,689
thing I used to do is we would go out

00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,949
and look for great talent so I wouldn't

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,719
wait for them to come through CV

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,800
applications I would go out and look for

00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:55,330
people who are the right type of person

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,860
my company was in the artists sales

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,020
section and we used to go to Cape Union

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,740
Mart to go shopping for customer service

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,379
people and we did a lot of our team came

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,629
from KP you know Mart which I don't know

00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,069
how eighth achill it is but it worked so

00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,990
that's step number one which you can do

00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,120
step two is to share your team's

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,620
personality through the site because the

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,569
more customers fuel that they know you

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,300
and your brand and your team the more

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,400
likely they are to bar with you so don't

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,289
hesitate to or don't think that your

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,879
company culture is the plank at face

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,979
that you show to the customers what you

00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,169
want to do is let your staff and your

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,759
team members show their own personality

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,139
so that they can feel free to engage

00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,120
with the customers and have a laugh and

00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,990
tell a joke and to really let them feel

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,389
that they're building a one-on-one

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,759
connection and that helps to go a long

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,800
way to help the customer to feel they

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,849
know you they know your company and next

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,050
on their phone they want to speak to

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,159
that guy again because they had such a

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,770
good interaction with them so one of the

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,639
challenges with e-commerce is that when

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,419
somebody goes shopping in a

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,189
bricks-and-mortar

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,080
environment they can have that

00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,460
face-to-face relationship they can go to

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,259
the back to the same shop and speak to

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,120
the same guy and they know that and

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,500
that's why people like to do that so

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
it's very difficult to replicate that

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,279
into an online situation but through

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,870
showing your team's personality and

00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,060
allowing the people in your team to be

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,229
themselves and to tell jokes and even if

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,569
a cerebral jokes let the guard be

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:18,039
himself but it really helps to build

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:20,439
that relationship and so sharing your

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,089
personalities through the website brings

00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,740
back that interpersonal connection

00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,300
now if you'll meet the team page should

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,430
really have a picture of every single

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,899
team member on your team and pictures of

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,250
them in their natural environments not

00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,449
standing against a brick wall was like a

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,009
white collar shirt because that's what

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,269
you told them sway that day it should

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,779
really be like if the guys in mount

00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,339
Ibaka

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,899
it's like afraid of him on a mountain

00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,569
bike and Gaza motor back I'd do the same

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,369
whatever somebody's

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,550
let's let them show that through the

00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:45,929
site and the thing is that if you've

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,129
done this correctly and you've gone and

00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:48,689
found the right people and you're

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,249
allowing them to be themselves and if

00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,869
you just let them be themselves and you

00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,589
don't kind of hold them back in any way

00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,419
shape or form

00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,099
then they'll do what they do best which

00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,779
as we know from step one is that they

00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,069
love to serve people and now you're

00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,779
allowing them to do that for your

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,479
customers and it's going to show with

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,949
returning customers and increasing sales

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,539
step three that you guys can do is

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,719
empower your team to be able to go above

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,939
and beyond this is a section way going

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,949
above and beyond is what is a

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,719
game-changer in fact you don't even have

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,309
to go above and beyond because Isis or

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:19,709
the Africans are so used to offering or

00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,539
receiving super average service that as

00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,529
soon as you get like decent service

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,729
people are blown away they're like hey

00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,409
did you see that that was pretty good

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,539
well when your parcel arrives like a day

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,979
before that's always supposed to then

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,509
people actually like comments about that

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,979
how bad is that we're so used to like

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,389
every service said as soon as you get a

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,369
little bit of better service you've

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,649
blown away but what if you let your team

00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:39,899
go above and beyond that's where the

00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,339
real game changes and your stuff

00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,659
shouldn't even need permission from you

00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,580
to be able to do this to be able to help

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,809
your customers they should be able to do

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,209
what they want whatever they feel

00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,919
because they are there are people who

00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:52,289
want to offer the help to the customers

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,519
and now you're allowing them to do that

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,649
so they should never need your

00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,050
permission to be able to drive out to go

00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,159
and help a customer or to be able to

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,139
stay late so that the customer can come

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,189
and collect or do something because if

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,879
you've got the right people they'll want

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:07,979
to do that what I've always done which I

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,269
feel I want to do because I'll show

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,279
gratitude towards the people who go

00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,659
above and beyond is I always offer spot

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,240
bonuses and then I also make a lot of

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,680
noise about the the good positive stuff

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,749
that they've done you know so if

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,800
somebody has done something even if it's

00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:25,219
so little that it seems insignificant

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,719
then we'll still like around the team

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:28,949
what I'm no longer in the business but

00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,869
we used to have a Monday morning scrum

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,219
meeting and every more every Monday

00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:34,680
morning would begin was positive

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,050
reinforcing mentions of people that

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,719
don't call staff so if we received an

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,399
email from somebody who did a customer

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,229
sent in a positive email we would

00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,579
forward that to the whole team and then

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,050
in Monday we would talk about that and

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,510
talk about that situation and you know

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,010
what was what was it that happened that

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,570
resulted in a customer actually taking

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,880
the time out of a day

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,020
to come in send us an email and then to

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,480
make a lot of noise about that so you

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,010
positively reinforce the behavior praise

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,300
the person who did that given the bonus

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,370
given the spot bonus or a weekend away

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,900
because they've been like really

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,110
reinforces the culture within your

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,300
business and as we know that is what

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,370
will help to grow your business we saw

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,740
massive returns on this kind of behavior

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,940
and it really it was never a barkat in

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,450
good returns it's just what we wanted to

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,130
do there was what our team was about

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,290
they aim pretty quickly yeah but step

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,020
number four is to over-promised and

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,720
ended right under promise and over

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,200
deliver not the other way around

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,110
there's to be people get it wrong what

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,280
you want to be doing is sorry this okay

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,990
so here's what I wanted to mention here

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,460
is that shipping is really where you

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,440
make and break your customer service and

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,990
if you guys have ever been on the

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,790
receiving end of a late shipment or an

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,590
incorrect shipment or a date on dinner

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,180
on a rival product then you'll know that

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,890
like that is the experience that you

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,780
kind of that really resonates with you

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,030
and it can also be the other way around

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,040
if the parcel arrives early so take a

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,450
lot does a super well they'll always say

00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,250
you know the shipping will be for five

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,950
days but then you go to the next day oh

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,540
that was quite us yeah and they do that

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,330
on purpose because it does several

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,920
things that always impresses a customer

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,960
but it also in terms of the strain on

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,250
the internal team there's no promise to

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,990
say that this parcel has to be our

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,190
tomorrow in any business owner here has

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,020
probably shouted at somebody to say this

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,010
person has to go out tomorrow and then

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,470
your phone in the courier saying the

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,370
customer needs it I promised him and

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,050
that's just putting strain on your

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,110
internal resources and it's causing a

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,880
lot of havoc in your team and you can

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,680
get away from that but by taking the

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,630
take lot approach to say you know let's

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,980
under promise and over deliver so tell

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,260
them all take two days and take one day

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,610
or include something extra give them a

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,540
log gift with purchase especially on

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,460
Christmas time now that we're

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,410
approaching gift time if you can get a

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,520
little flash drive or a chocolate or

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,620
something and put it in the box with him

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,880
that little bit of extra it's user

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,890
experience just kind of like puts a

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,150
smile in their face and they'll go and

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,140
tell their friends about it and that

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,780
brings us more sales

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,400
so delivering on time it's what they

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,570
expect that's like average service

00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,010
that's you told them it's going to be

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,740
there tomorrow and they get it tomorrow

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,510
great okay cool but what if firm you

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
deliver ahead of schedule so you told

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,519
them three days and they get it tomorrow

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,690
anyway now that's a while experience

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,019
this is what's a clot seems to have done

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,089
super well and you just got to keep in

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,910
mind that the information on your

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,860
website about your shipping is one of

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,930
the most read pages when P somebody's

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,910
going through the checkout because when

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,170
you're placing an order the question

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,759
that's resonating in the back your mind

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,620
it's we're am I going to get this so

00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,170
your shipping information has to be

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,759
super easy to find you know generally

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,959
you'll be in the footer or there'll be a

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,759
link somewhere in the checkout with a

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,170
spotlight window and you want to answer

00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,519
that question so you never leave that

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,199
off that question unanswered because

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,339
that's can cause a lot of drop-offs when

00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,630
somebody's like going through the

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,579
checkout but they still don't know like

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,649
how long is it going to get this like I

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,389
ordered a pair of shoes that shorts off

00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,000
a really cool website that I like called

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,410
African made only and after I checked

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,149
out I got an email to say we're gonna

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,759
we're not gonna start making your shorts

00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,040
and you'll get them in 10 days which is

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,360
ok because I was in no rush but like I

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,550
didn't see that anywhere in the checkout

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,769
process now if I was in a rush so I

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,120
could be upset about that so having all

00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,490
the shipping information very clearly

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,839
available helps because I said that

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,760
shipping as William you make and break

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,720
your customer service so firstly you

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,690
want to tell them what your guidelines

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,829
are if it's one day tell them one day if

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,199
it's three days tell them three days

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,490
make them not make it very easy to find

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,190
that's one of the biggest questions that

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,800
they have and then try and over deliver

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,510
on your promise so you want to kind of

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
use that as a tool because shipping is

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,899
really the place where you can do

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,010
everything right in your customer

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,810
service in your webpage copy and your

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,370
checkout process can be super smooth and

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,300
then on the delivery you're a day late

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,730
and the customer is you say yes question

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,170
cool the last tip that I've got for you

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,449
today is to shout about positive

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,069
feedback so I mentioned this already

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,720
because it is team sounds harder to get

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,550
a positive positive review than a

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,170
negative one that's super easy to get a

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,300
negative one people love to tell those

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,329
stories so you got to try your utmost to

00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,089
make people happy when you get positive

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,529
feedback talk about it like talked about

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,850
in your internal meetings ask the

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,939
customer if you can post a lot on social

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,199
media and we had action gear my last

00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:09,990
business we had what we called the

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,959
raving fan wall which was a giant wall

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,670
with like little frames and we used to

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,230
print them out and whichever staff

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,560
member got their positive feedback they

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,810
had like the ceremony where

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,790
go and hang a thing like and it was like

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,100
I was just for kiss and there was a lot

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,930
of fun but it really was something proud

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,339
when we walked past that and you go and

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,569
you read all the nice feedback that we

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,339
got from customers because you get

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,899
you'll get nice feedback everybody here

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,519
gets nice feedback and you can either

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,990
archive that email and forget about it

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,279
but we can go and save it somewhere or

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,079
printed and frame it and stick it on a

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,249
wall and that is also a nice talking

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,470
point where more customers or more

00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,610
clients arrive at your office and they

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,740
stop and they look at this thing in our

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,449
Wow Jesus these guys offer a really good

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,589
customer service it's like because now

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:48,699
it's referrals like it's almost

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,529
word-of-mouth even though they're just

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,519
reading it off a wall so we used to do

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:56,379
that and it all kind of came together to

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,480
create a culture where our entire team

00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,120
was truly truly passionate about

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,939
offering great customer service and and

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,129
we were very grateful that's in the 2015

00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:08,110
new Africa awards for e-commerce we took

00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,059
home that bat topper would take beating

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,389
take a lot and Whittle by and yuppie

00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:14,769
chef and all of the big names and and it

00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,629
was just off the base of doing kind of

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,059
what I've spoken about today encouraging

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,980
your customers or firstly getting the

00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,480
rostoff into a team the people that

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,370
actually inherently want to offer good

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,319
customer service and then empowering him

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,399
to do so and then talking about making a

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,410
lot of noise when you hit that good

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,930
customer service or good feedback back

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,930
from them so really it's an easy process

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,839
for me it gave a massive amount of

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,790
additional sales and getting somebody to

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,439
shop with you again it's far cheaper and

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,600
far easier than it is to go and find a

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:46,569
new customer and this is how you do it

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,579
so I hope that this has been of interest

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,620
ecommerce as everybody in this room

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,689
knows this is the future of business and

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,370
this is where it's all going and this is

00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:55,569
why you guys are here and I hope that

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,649
you've learned lots of other we came

00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:00,069
because there's lots of good value

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,870
that's coming out of this room and if

00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:04,329
ecommerce is on a hockey stove growth

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,679
curve a hockey stick growth curve like

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,000
we're right at that point where it's not

00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,679
kicking off and you guys in this room

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,569
are right or getting in at the right

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,610
time if you came to Nexus where it can

00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:14,290
pretty much just be too late so don't

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,670
kind of dwell on this don't hop on it

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,199
don't take too long to kind of get your

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,249
site up and running like really take

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,899
this and now make this into your life

00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,879
make this into your business because it

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,499
really can be a big operation you can

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,449
make a success button you can make money

00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:28,269
that that funds the lifestyle that you

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,640
want as a very successful business owner

00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:32,530
