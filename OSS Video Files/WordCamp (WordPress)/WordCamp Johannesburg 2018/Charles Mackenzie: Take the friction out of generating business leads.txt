all right what are events for today very

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,420
nice and simple we are going to look at

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,110
a picture I'm going to tell you a story

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,450
and then I'm going to give you a plan so

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,389
nice and easy probably the best slide of

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,929
the entire weekend three slides to the

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,240
after-party

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,010
we're almost there you can do it hang in

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,250
there should be fun

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,930
awesome so here's a picture it's been

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,640
interesting because people have been

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,640
talking about funnels and things like

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
that I'm sorry to tell you that funnels

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,079
are so last year

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,690
it's now a flywheel there's a company

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,550
called hub spot you may or may not have

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,379
heard of them they're one of the leaders

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,510
and inbound marketing and it's all about

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,730
how do you merge sales and marketing and

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,469
how do you take what previously was a

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,020
funnel and how do you get people to go

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,469
from being strangers to being delighted

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,570
advocates of your brand so they've

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,969
recently revamped it this is not

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,390
completely our own idea this is an

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,100
adaption of what they've done and it's

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,100
based on their flywheel if you search

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,290
HubSpot flywheel you'll find online

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,090
courses and all that kind of stuff which

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,250
will give you a lot more detail around

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,340
this sort of thing but the idea behind

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,060
this really is you want to make it a

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,990
circle that like goes around in a circle

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,970
I'm tempted to think of the my sister

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,460
used to drive me crazy with it's a cycle

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,189
a water cycle goes round and round again

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,170
and I'll stop there but literally she's

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,759
sitting out for hours but the problem

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,470
with the funnel is things come into the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,170
top so you got this big white pot and

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,610
then they go at the bottom and then

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,189
that's the end of it where does it go

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,130
you lost it so the whole idea behind

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,000
this flywheel or the cycle is that it

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,829
starts to get momentum and basically

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,720
what happens is you start off attracting

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,729
people you engage those people then

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,170
hopefully you delight those people we've

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,700
heard a couple of different people talk

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,340
about you know Facebook how do you

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,750
peepee with the PPC side you know how do

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,460
you get your website working so it's

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,259
nice and engaging we spoke about

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,360
customer service a little bit earlier

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,310
today and how to life people but then

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,890
you want to take those people who now at

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,390
the end of the old funnel and you now

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,140
want to say okay well how can we get

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,390
those P

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,400
to tell other people because now those

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,069
people are attracting these people and

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,500
now the cycle starts going round and

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,130
round again and if you can get that to

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,110
be bigger and faster and easier then now

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,660
what happens is your marketing and your

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,580
sales if it is now actually building a

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,550
life of its own as it's going around and

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,990
round and round and round again make

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,270
sense

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,900
happy great stuff cool so just so we're

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,239
all on the same page attract is how do

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,880
you get people to find out who you are

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,190
often with SMEs one of the biggest

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,110
problems that they face is people simply

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,730
don't know who you are they never heard

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,200
your name you trying to introduce them

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,720
you're trying to build trust but you

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,610
don't have any platform or any way that

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,350
you can do that outside of how you

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,690
present yourself all the things you show

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,000
them and you can do that through it's

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,730
your paid search online websites you can

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,590
do brand activation yes there are things

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,600
like billboards out there and magazines

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,700
should try putting an ad on them

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,860
sometime

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,209
they do still work and those are a whole

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,220
bunch of different things you can do to

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,000
attract people to your brand to your

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,739
business once you have that you need to

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,810
engage with them some ways either you've

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,820
got an app or a facebook profile or

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,860
you've got a website or whatever it

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,870
might be even a call center somewhere

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,070
when you get these people who out there

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,350
that you don't know about these

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,570
strangers to come and kind of start

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,670
being your friends a little bit and then

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,190
you won't get you want them to buy from

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,810
you or engage with you or call your

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,790
sales person or do something but you

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,790
want to have some sort of transaction

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,620
with these people and then once you've

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,250
got them there you want to make them

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,290
really really happy what can you do to

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,290
make these people love you so customer

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,730
service is a great way of doing it where

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,870
you give them something and they just

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,630
love you they want to tell good stories

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,070
about you and I'm only going to try

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,780
repeat what was said today at legit

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,640
really really really well done

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,340
the other thing that you can do is you

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,620
can do things like give people voucher

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,750
codes or promotion codes well a reason

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,130
to come back to you so if you're gonna

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,049
take a care package or something like

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,030
that maybe you could say well for the

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,650
month or whatever for all of our loyal

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,760
customers we're giving a discount of

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,060
this much come

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,380
to us and just it's just one way that

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,900
you can delight them with product

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,610
updates news information that sort of

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,820
thing that they continue to see you as

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,560
their trusted advisor this is my source

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,480
of information I want to come to these

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,640
guys because they know what's going on

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,230
they love me they care for me and I love

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,870
them so I'm gonna go and tell all my

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,370
friends about them and then so now

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,270
you've got these people attracting it in

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:58,710
and so we go around everyone happy with

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,490
a flywheel in a nutshell cool great now

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,740
story time so the story is what not to

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,060
do

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,140
unfortunately I was one of the chief

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,970
architects in the story and so I'll try

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,760
to keep it as anonymous as possible but

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,730
I'll also be honest so we had a client I

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,360
had a client some time in my previous

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,220
past and we they didn't want to spend a

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,100
huge amount of money with us so we took

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,660
over their website but because they

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,950
don't want to invest too much into it

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,480
because they're already spent it with

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,750
someone else and they're moving across

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,340
and we said we'll just leave your

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,900
website as it is and we'll run this

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,850
campaign for you to generate business

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,340
leads because that's all they wanted

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,540
they wanted people to phone them fill

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,100
out forms and their website so they

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,280
could phone them and sell them their

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,410
product so we ran this campaign for a

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
month and at the end of the month we sat

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,610
down with them we said right how did it

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,860
go wait I just completely forgot

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,680
something we have a competition of our

00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,910
company ends the end of this month

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,250
before I think it's I'll be in trouble

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,470
if I forget we can win a website to the

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,930
value of twenty five thousand rand if

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,320
you can't enter go to our website it's

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,300
flicker leap calm over there and you

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,990
send transferred any website you know so

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,880
after a month very good okay keeping

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,300
them keeping the people happy all right

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,250
so after month I mean sat down with them

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,670
said how's it going great we've been

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,880
getting leads it's working I'm like

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,290
fantastic this is wonderful news

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,540
two months in we're gonna sit back down

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,280
with him again on our side I know our

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,210
reporting people are filling out forms

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
it's working

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,449
how's it going great you're we've been

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,639
getting quite a few phone

Paul's very very happy now it's like

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,990
phone calls what about the emails

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,569
because we've seen that they've been

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,400
like 30 people who filled out the form

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,559
and usually got 30 emails with these

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,870
people I don't know what you talking

00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,520
about what emails like what do you mean

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,439
what emails like we've been running this

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,110
entire campaign for two months to get

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,110
you these leads and they should have

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,309
come to you as an email no I don't know

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,559
okay

00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:09,629
well trying to save face in the meeting

00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,309
I'm like I know that if you log into

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,900
WordPress then you can check your

00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:16,139
entries because they're saved into like

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,490
a little database there so I'm trying to

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,770
hack around but now it's a different

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,479
theme because that what I'm used to so

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,279
I'm not too sure where to look so now

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,979
I'm really looking bad in front of the

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,659
client cuz like I can't find anything

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,490
anyway so I'm like no I'll go talk to

00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,580
the guys in the office and we can solve

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,120
this problem anyway get back to the

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,139
office

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,849
turns out they were using a theme they

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,919
were just using like a generic form on

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:43,759
the website that doesn't store people's

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,029
information when you fill out the form

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,620
so for two months and then the next

00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,680
thing is they'd been like some mix-up

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,680
with their email service provider where

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,009
the emails just that were sent just kind

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,229
of fell off into no way there's no email

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,969
INBOX

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,680
this guy had 40 people contact his

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:06,930
business I need paid for these leads

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,240
we'd been running a campaign so it was a

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,219
little bit dear to him and now we've got

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,139
no leads so I'm gonna find him and be

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,499
like look I'm really sorry

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,469
we've got nothing for you absolutely

00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:21,089
nothing but what we'll do is we'll fix

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:23,759
your website up we'll put something on

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,249
anyway we now fix it so now the forum

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,839
every time gets filled in it gets stored

00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:30,860
into a database so no matter what

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,750
happens we know what's going on right

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,120
month three sit down I'm very happy with

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,069
we've now got even more leads and we had

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,110
previously you had a better month then

00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,579
all the months combined sit down with

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,399
the client to say just so you know

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:48,300
here's the export of all the leads and

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,519
it's working really really well and this

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,959
email back to me is like I was actually

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,140
just about to find you to cancel

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,170
everything because I

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,060
haven't got any emails like what do you

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,660
mean you didn't get any emails we've

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,000
been through this his lock turns out his

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,080
server company server hosting provider

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,790
had what they've done was there had

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,490
white labeled the website because it was

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,920
coming from the same domain name as the

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,360
email and so their email server saw that

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,980
as spam if you don't know I'm talking

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,320
about don't worry all you need to know

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,260
is the garden get the emails so now we

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,940
have to fix this problem end of three

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,530
months he's now got close to sixty

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:34,780
people who contacted him with no word

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:38,590
from him at all lots of friction in his

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:41,290
flywheel first off there was horrible

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,150
communication between us and them I when

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,330
I asked him if he was getting leads and

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,090
he said yes I was like it's working but

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,760
it wasn't working so we took way too

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,560
long to talk to this person just flat

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,600
out the communication was bad I didn't

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,430
understand him heed and understand me we

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,860
were just getting it wrong the next

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,550
thing was the customers just got bad

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,380
service

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,810
no one was delighted with this guy

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,150
because no one was getting phone calls

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,940
imagine you went onto a website and you

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,040
contacted someone and you just never

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,360
heard from them what is your opinion of

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,250
their business it's not great but

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,350
unprofessional they're not courteous

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,460
they're not following up you don't want

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,020
to work with them you'll go somewhere

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,300
else they're not obviously not

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,310
interested in helping you and the third

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,370
problem we had is that we had no way of

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,930
capturing this data to make sure things

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,080
were happening there were no checks and

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,900
balances in place it really was not what

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,010
not to do

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,880
can everyone agree with the fact that

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,260
that was horrible yes and I got to sit

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,670
in the office every day and be like I

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,350
can't believe what's going on for the

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,630
sky so how can you not do what I did in

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,360
this instance so the first thing is

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,580
craft relevant and personal user

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,290
journeys we've spoken a little bit

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,480
during the course of the last two days

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,360
about segmentation understanding your

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,200
customer what do they want but you

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,740
really just need to think through who

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,420
is the person what device do they use

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,220
are they on the phone or on a desktop

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,680
computer what time of the day are they

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,120
looking at if it's a business person

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,880
you're most likely going to get them in

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,530
work hours if it's someone outside of

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,330
that maybe the weekend or late at night

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,670
early morning you know if you want to

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,810
reach cyclists a good time is like five

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,520
o'clock on a Saturday and a Sunday

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,690
morning because that's when they up and

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,030
they're on their way to go see their

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,760
mates not a bad time to show a campaign

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,520
maybe but think about who these people

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,050
are and then what is relevant to them

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,460
what's gonna jump out at them what's

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,410
gonna give them something that's gonna

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,560
go oh this is interesting I want to see

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,090
more of it because if it's gonna be

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,100
attractive so that you can attract

00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:53,360
people it really needs to be something

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,980
that's going to stand out and then the

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,590
nice thing about all of these things is

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,270
you have to really think about how how's

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,220
this person gonna give us the

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,460
information and how can we make it easy

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,490
because if you want a business lead you

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:10,580
need to get at least a name and number

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,740
and an email address or one of those so

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,690
that you can either email them or phone

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,940
them to actually provide them with the

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,180
service if you don't get that

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,670
information you've wasted everything so

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,430
what can you do together make it really

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,080
easy so there's some CRM systems like

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,150
hub spot where you can have a form that

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,340
pops up on every page of your website so

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,680
wherever they come from you can get the

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,090
information or you can put calls to

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,310
action on your page you can have

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,830
newsletters you can have promotions you

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,580
can have ebooks or downloads or video

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,610
content but all of it is accessible for

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,630
an email address or a phone number

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,920
because then you've got something that

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:57,590
you can use the next thing with this is

00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:01,540
how so not how is pretend to be your

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:05,330
customer because very often we think

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,220
like the business and we know it and we

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,020
understand it and we use it and we're

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,660
there all the time and we're very

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,110
familiar with it but we don't often see

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,800
what our customer sees so we once had a

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,970
client and they asked us they needed

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
some help with

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,540
to click campaign and so we're able to

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,029
go in there and solve their problem but

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,740
we thought let's just expand our view

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,899
just a little bit and pretend to be a

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,360
customer let's try and sign up for one

00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,250
of their courses so we went on to their

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,259
website filled out a form we didn't get

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,629
any emails back nothing no automated

00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:41,779
things and no one ever replied to us

00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:44,209
so like Wow okay that didn't work so

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:48,199
that's a problem so then what we said

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,850
was well let's find them so I phoned

00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,529
them and said I'd like to register for

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,569
one of your courses and they said oh you

00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,850
need to speak to so-and-so and this

00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:58,639
person can help you I'll get them to

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,050
call you back they never called me back

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,850
I was trying to give them business and

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,959
there was no way for me to actually do

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,069
it like I couldn't engage with them and

00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,750
so when we went back to them we said

00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:13,370
well look you know you had some issues

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,629
with your pay-per-click campaign but

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,370
actually do you got a few other issues

00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,870
you need to sort out like if you're

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,649
trying to be a customer of this business

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,899
it's very very hard work to do you know

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,939
enroll or sign up or whatever it is and

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,160
you're only ever going to find that out

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:31,519
by actually trying to be your customer

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,230
and if you can't do it get your partner

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,180
or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,370
your auntie or your uncle get someone

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,860
else to try and do it someone who's a

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,269
bit more removed and ask them for their

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,720
feedback how did it go

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:46,220
you know actually make a purchase

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,779
sometimes we use test environments and

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,930
sandbox credit cards and all those

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:52,850
wonderful things put that aside take out

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,610
a real wallets real card and actually

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,240
make a purchase what happens get the

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,129
person to deliver the product to you see

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,620
what the whole thing looks like and

00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,120
you'll start to see this process of

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,910
attracting engaging and delighting

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,240
customers will become a little bit more

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,730
apparent to you less identify and

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,430
monitor key performance metrics so have

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,949
a look at your big process of these of

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,110
what you're trying to do work out what

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:24,259
your goals are and then say well what

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,300
numbers do we need a check so three ones

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,490
three simple ones to have a look at is

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,630
how many people who visit your website

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,530
or your platform who you attract become

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,300
a lead

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,850
they engage with you actually give you

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,100
information how many people do that

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,020
other people who give you their

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,870
information how many become a customer

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,230
and then of your customers how many

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,000
refer you to someone else and you can

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,290
track that with referral codes depending

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,270
on your product or you could just simply

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,370
ask people how did you find out about us

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,980
but if you can start to see those

00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,750
numbers you can see oh or actually we've

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,970
got a big problem because from this

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,650
stage to this stage it doesn't seem to

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,630
work or from this stage to this stage

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,100
whatever it might be it's going to be

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,170
different for your business but if you

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,360
know what you're trying to do you can

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,900
start to map it and it can really help

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,430
you to do that

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,010
the next part about this is really how

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,280
can you add momentum and reduce friction

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,920
so if you've got this cycle what other

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,420
what can you do that's really gonna make

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,460
a difference if you're gonna do

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,110
something you might as well do something

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,680
that's gonna actually help or make a

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,630
change or do something that's gonna like

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll stall not to use this but move the

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,150
needle as it were like what's gonna like

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,450
really shift your business what is that

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,510
it could be crazy it could be simple but

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,970
whatever that thing is do that and see

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,070
what happens try an iterative approach

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,270
try it just do something I think it's

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,030
come out quite a few times

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,089
in the during the course of the last two

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,860
days just try something but if you're

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,510
gonna do something make it count don't

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,260
just be like oh we'll change the color

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,350
of the button

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,689
yeh or maybe that is what you need I

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,520
don't know but if you're going to do

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,939
something to really give this thing a

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,500
good kick in the pants as it were do

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,230
something that's going to make a make an

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,170
impact and then what will make it easier

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,490
maybe there's something that needs to be

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,740
automated maybe there's something which

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,319
needs a person's like you actually need

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,510
to phone someone at this one stage work

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,670
out what those things are so that you

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,230
can really remove the friction so that

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,000
if you're going to add momentum to this

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,320
thing it's going to spin a little bit

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,880
better it's going to work a little bit

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,500
faster it's going to be a little bit

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,750
easier for people and I think there's

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,950
been a few too few talks to this the

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,770
last few days that have spoken about

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,330
automation how can you use that to your

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,429
benefit what can you do that

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,279
your life easier all makes your

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,899
customers easier your la the life of

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,760
your customers easier because there's

00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:57,679
two sides to this what how you work and

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,600
it's what they experience on the outside

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,940
and what are those things and how can

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,919
you make those changes and then lastly

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,510
and I can't iterate this one enough make

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
the customer the center of what you're

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,210
trying to do there are other reason that

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,789
your brand exists your company exists to

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,039
service the needs of your customer think

00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:19,220
of things from their point of view build

00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,980
your business around them not your

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,380
processes or your logistics or your

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,029
operations or your ideas of what's

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,399
market of what your marketing should

00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,620
look like think of it from your customer

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:34,690
put your customer in the middle and get

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,149
things to work around that make sense

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:41,210
cool and then very lastly information is

00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:44,299
everything if you can get information if

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,970
you can build the CRM system or customer

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,889
database or whatever it might be those

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,049
things can make a huge difference to you

00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:53,929
and your business and they're very very

00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:56,690
simple tools you can start to understand

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,299
people okay so this person came from

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,340
social media from that post so when I

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,019
pick up the phone and phone them that's

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,720
what they're interested in that's what

00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,450
they need help with so you can you can

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,970
start the call off with a warm lead not

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,010
a hi how did you get all of us you know

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,169

see all of these different things oh so

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,830

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,870
interested in this type of thing and

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,929

that's really interesting what what part

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,889
of it interesting you could start a

00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,960
whole conversation and you can show

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:34,399
yourself to be the trusted advisor who

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,029
