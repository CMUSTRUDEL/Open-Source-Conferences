okay so we're first gonna do a little

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,690
bit of questions just to get the vibe so

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,639
who hates introductions raise of hands

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,320
everyone loves introductions you like

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,619
introducing yourself to people okay

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,560
maybe it's just me okay now who's new to

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,660
WordPress and WooCommerce show of hands

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
not brand new but like you're newbie

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,939
you're starting don't know everything

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,660
about WordPress or WooCommerce right

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:39,800
okay then who is falling asleep during

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:42,960
conference cool yeah a few people now

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:52,289
the next one is quite intense so first

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:55,010
reader then raise your hands nobody

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,969
thinks that they can do that one person

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:03,149
two people okay

00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:05,610
okay this is a very weird one but it's

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,799
just to get there so nobody Nia's ever

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,740
lied to their mom I don't believe that

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,939
for a second okay now find out the name

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,229
and job of the person sitting in front

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,400
of you behind you you do not have an

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,960
excuse if you're sitting in the front

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,189
line there has to be someone behind you

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,509
that you can talk to and if you're

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,770
sitting in the back line there has to be

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,320
someone in the front of you that you can

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:31,549
ask so their name and also their job

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,549
next to you behind you

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,940
[Music]

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,160
okay great

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,750
let's get back to this so now you can't

00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,060
say that you didn't a twerk cuz now you

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,890
all made someone here or someone you

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,860
already knew

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,280
okay who's now ready to start okay here

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,450
we go

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,160
okay so Facebook Ads manager the reason

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,320
I decided to do this this workshop is

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,149
actually because I think a lot of people

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,150
don't actually know what it can do for

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,940
you and how it also integrates with

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,050
WooCommerce and what praise necessarily

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,240
need to only integrate with WooCommerce

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,680
you don't even need to be able to sell

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,270
products to do the adverts you can

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,090
advertise your service you can advertise

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,980
yourself you can literally add eyes

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,410
everything if you can't see me the

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,070
pillar so a little bit like but yeah

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,570
okay

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,430
so the thing about Facebook Ads manager

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,550
is that I think a lot of people in South

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:43,120
Africa think that it's expensive and

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,150
it's not you can advertise for 10-round

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,940
a day so if you have a budget a month

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,530
for 30 grand you can advertise for 3

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,570
days in a row it will only debit your

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,050
account for 30 grand and there you go

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,610
and it is so extremely detailed that you

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,239
can actually target people who are

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:03,580
looking for your very very specific

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,170
services your products even target

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,050
people that's already been to your

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,790
website to make them come back to your

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,500
website that's a very very powerful tool

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,989
we call that a conversion you converted

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,800
them to go back to your side and do

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,300
something or buy something so yes so

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,090
that's it's a little bit of a passion of

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,130
mine is Facebook Ads manager if I go too

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,290
fast today please raise your hand I

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,190
attend to talk very fast my brain works

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,700
overtime so just go like slow down and

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll do it

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,290
ok so first I'm going to just mention

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,150
like what my goals is for you guys today

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,560
but the main thing is that everybody

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,120
should at least have made one Facebook

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,550
advertising

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,160
and it's not difficult so you have no

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:51,670
excuse so make sure that you have a

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,190
Facebook page open if you can if the

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,870
Internet allows it but otherwise just

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,050
make notes as I go if the internet

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,670
doesn't allow it

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,640
I've got everything on screenshots as

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,370
well all right I'll also post this whole

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,410
talk on site so they'll probably ask all

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,300
the speakers for their slides so it'll

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,000
also be available after but the idea is

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,560
for it to be a workshop so if you are

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,080
struggling with something specific and

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,910
there's someone who's like successfully

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,350
flying away over there then we're going

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,120
to ask them to just collaborate with you

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,930
and help you out until you're like okay

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,290
I got this

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,270
because actually integrating pixel with

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,920
WooCommerce is a really really powerful

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,920
tool and it will be amazing if you guys

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,410
could do that at least today okay so

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,760
make one at Facebook advert everyone

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,170
should have pixel installed or

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,660
understand how to do it in the future

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,490
and then understand what Facebook Ads

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,470
manager can do for you so just a little

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,780
bit of like the background we might not

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,640
go into super detail with all of the

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,500
like conversions and custom because

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,440
that's obviously based on your business

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,930
so I can go and tell you how to look for

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,730
certain things in Facebook Ads manager

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,950
but it'll obviously be very specific to

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,850
you so even when we go through it and

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,500
you decide okay I would rather focus on

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,080
reaching as many people as possible then

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,600
trying to target this little amount of

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,150
people so as we go decide for yourself

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,470
what will work for your company your

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,990
personal business whatever you feel like

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,570
okay so those are my goals for today

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,010
everybody clear on that so you're all

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,880
gonna try and make a Facebook ad word

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,730
today that works great okay so just a

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,169
little bit what is Facebook pixel so

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,430
before we start I just want to explain

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,800
what it is this is not a developer talk

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,690
so I'm not going to go into the code but

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,820
you can literally sit up pixel yourself

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,070
as a user you don't need a developer to

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,650
do it they've made it super easy for you

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,070
it's a plugin it links up by itself and

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,650
bam it works so there's no hard cool

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,870
code that you have to like go and do if

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,340
you want to do that you could feel very

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,340
big websites they do recommend that

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,620
because then you get a lot more data but

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,480
for a small website or big web so

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,790
doesn't matter you can just link it up

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,229
very quickly okay so the Facebook pixel

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,560
is basically a piece of code that's

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,550
placed on your website and it reports

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,020
back on what half

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,300
on your website so it can tell you these

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,009
this is the data that you get from the

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,889
website this is your traffic on this

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,710
page so for example on your home page

00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:27,710
you had heard this many views the past

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,590
week this many people actually clicked

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,810
on the shop shop now button this many

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,650
people checked out so it's very very

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,379
very detailed very very good so it

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,449
reports back on a lot of things

00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:44,539
conversions built audiences so your

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,650
audience for example would be lets say

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,860
for me it would be people who ride a

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,419
horse obviously so that's very very

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,370
targeted but let's say you're selling

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:56,240
traces you can literally target half the

00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:00,610
population so it's really depends on

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,349
your demographics of type of people okay

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,000
you can create up to ten pixels as well

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,190
so let's say you're a developer and

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,620
you've got for example five sites that

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,479
you that you do work for you could ask

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,430
them to integrate the pixel you can have

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,319
it under your account as well all this

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,479
but you can have more than one pixel

00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,130
code linked to more than one website so

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,130
for example on mine I've got word camp

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,530
job x1 and then I also have my horse one

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,750
and I've got two other sites as well on

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,819
your Facebook Ads manager because if

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,520
you're the admin of your Facebook ads

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:38,599
you can also see all the pixel results

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,770
okay okay so let's start ok so first I'm

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,580
going to show you how to set up the

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,380
pixel how to integrate it and how to get

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,520
to your ads manager this is actually

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,440
something I really struggled with in the

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,210
beginning it's like wait is this and

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,340
then sometimes when you click on advert

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,069
you're like oh here it is so I'll show

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,229
you how to get deep and then also the

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,930
events manager so what they mean by

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:02,150
events is specifically like check out

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,729
page views that those are like the type

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,199
of events that they talk about so if you

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,599
are in your Facebook I don't know how

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,580
fast internet here is but if you can go

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,289
onto your Facebook wall you'll find it

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,449
on the side this it's a very very very

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,569
bad screenshot but it shows you exactly

00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,830
where it is so you can actually see

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,330
it'll be on this side yes so if these

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,909
are the pages that you manage then as

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,050
manager will be right over there okay

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,819
does everybody can I just

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,409
by show of hands see who actually did

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,280
the homework so who has already

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:33,380
installed pixel few people okay so

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,300
should I go through installing the pixel

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,769
for you guys and then I also want to

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,380
know who actually already has ads

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,060
manager on their Facebook page like you

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,060
can actually see it the way I pointed it

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,480
out okay a few people okay great so

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,339
we're like in between alright so the

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,990
pixel if you're really struggling with

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,329
this just ask the people who put their

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,100
hands up now that already has it but I'm

00:08:53,329 --> 00:09:00,649
going to try and guide you step by step

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:02,180
as well alright get back here okay so

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,310
this is actually what your ads manager

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,180
looks like if you can't see just please

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,829
move forward but if you click on that

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,839
little red button that I just showed you

00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:15,500
on the side this is what the ads manager

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,240
looks like okay so first you need to go

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,140
into Facebook and then you need to find

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,519
this ads manager it's anyone done that

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,410
okay so there's two ways of doing this

00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,670
if you do not have the ads manager on

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,320
your Facebook yet I'm going to show you

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,720
how to get the pixel directly from your

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,120
commerce site as well okay so it's not

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,680
you can either install the plug-in and

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,810
then go to your Facebook or you can do

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,540
it this way I find a lot of people know

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,760
Facebook more than they know the

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,800
WordPress back office okay so you're

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,980
going to click on pixels right there

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:53,660
under events manager and then it'll

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:55,430
throw out this little block so this is

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,100
seriously they've made it as easy as

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:05,000
they possibly can for you to create it's

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:06,829
not a train smash to create it you can

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,980
also look at the slides later and do it

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:11,449
later and then just jot down notes for

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,699
now if you can't do this right now

00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:20,570
okay so everyone clicked on it then your

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:23,269
next step so for a lot of people if

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,220
you're not a developer you are not going

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,470
to obviously choose manually install the

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,029
code yourself because yeah that's if

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,230
they take the code they go and put it on

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,020
the website if you don't know where it

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,300
can get very complicated but most of us

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,250
are using either WordPress over comers

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,120
so you're going to click on the very

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,370
first

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,639
that actually says use an integration or

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:50,360
tag manager okay if you click on that

00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:52,850
one are you guys they or not did you

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,910
click into ads manager you can literally

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,980
do this for your own personal Facebook

00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,660
as well like a lot of people have their

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,029
own brand you know I'm a developer I

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,709
work off-site I work for a company but I

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,600
would like to advertise my services so I

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,949
would like to at least get some more

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,670
customers so I can get some more money

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:12,889
okay so if you click on integration or

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,449
tag manager it actually throws out

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,160
there's a little bit more if you scroll

00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:19,610
to the top this is a screenshot so I

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,930
can't scroll to the top but if you click

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,910
on that you can actually see that you

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,550
can integrate with WooCommerce or

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,139
WordPress so what commerce I think is

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,569
more for people who are product paste

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,959
and then WordPress you can obviously if

00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:34,040
you have a website that's like service

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:41,209
based as well

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:42,740
WordPress okay then you owe to so you

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,660
can choose yeah it doesn't really matter

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,730
it'll create the pixel anyway based on

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,410
your website if you are using book

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,509
commerce choose WooCommerce rather than

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,100
WordPress if you don't have who covers

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:56,000
on your website and you're just using

00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:01,670
WordPress with the theme or as is click

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:07,449
on WordPress okay then it starts with a

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:09,680
little connect your WordPress account so

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,360
the other thing is that you must just

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,279
make sure that your WordPress version is

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,199
right you'll see it says this

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,319
integration is supported for WordPress

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,230
versions 4.4 and above so if you are on

00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:23,149
a bit of an older version of WordPress

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,649
pixel might not be able to integrate so

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:29,029
just make sure that you're all updated

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,040
with your latest WordPress updates and

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:34,610
it is also the first question your

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,709
developer will ask you is your plugins

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:42,199
updated okay alright then you can just

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,540
click on continue oh sorry you have to

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,920
download this file I bet so it's not

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,959
very big you can just click on download

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,399
and it will download the zip file and

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,440
this is the file that you'll have to

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,990
upload into your WordPress

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,790
site so now it creates the pixel for

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,970
your Facebook and it basically puts it

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,560
into your WordPress site so if you've

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,210
downloaded that then you have to now

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,250
negev navigate so I'll give you a bit of

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:08,750
time to navigate to your WordPress site

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,450
so if you've downloaded this file just

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,080
make sure you know where you've saved it

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,600
so click on download wait for it it'll

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,030
make a zip file and it'll probably throw

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,130
it in your dark bits folder unless you

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,510
choose to save it somewhere else so if

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,440
you've clicked on download just make

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,630
sure you know where you save it because

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,460
you have to go and get that file now to

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:33,320
upload it into WordPress go alright

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,820
after this I'm going to go through the a

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,090
bit more detail of the Facebook Ads

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:42,860
manager once we get process yeah alright

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,600
if you navigate to yours it's a really

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:51,800
bad screenshot but if you navigate to

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:53,570
your wordpress back-office you'll

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,250
obviously first just see your dashboard

00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,710
and then you'll go to this one so this

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,850
is exactly the same it's just a closer

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,310
up screenshot so on that gray strip on

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,210
the side you'll find plugins and then

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,210
click on add new

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:19,970
okay so selector it's called the

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,370
Facebook for WooCommerce zip file it'll

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,830
be in your downloads or some way whether

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,600
you save your files that you download

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:32,830
then you just click on add new button

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,510
and it will upload it to the website ok

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,839
once it's uploaded like this you click

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,390
on activate plug-in to activate that

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,550
because NAT now if that's not live and

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,339
it's not activated Facebook can't find

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,560
that code and your next step is to

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,140
literally taste traffic to your website

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,030
so this plug-in needs to be activated in

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,030
order to work

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,910
okay I'm gonna move on if you're

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,240
struggling either ask me or ask someone

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:14,800
that you look around and see if there's

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:16,990
someone okay so after you've installed

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,790
that plugin Facebook now wants to

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,860
basically verify if your plug-in is

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,580
installed and if it's actually working

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,070
correctly

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,010
so it's going to ask you to enter the

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,260
URL for this website so the website

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,030
where you uploaded your pixel code that

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,560
websites domain you're now going to type

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,600
into this bar right into the URL for

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,850
this website so their guidelines is very

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,580
very easy so you want to do it in the

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,310
future I'm sure you'll be able to figure

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:52,090
it out then you click on st. taste

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:53,590
traffic so if it doesn't work it

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,420
actually throws out an error that says

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,010
either your plug-in didn't download

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,580
correct you didn't install it correctly

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,940
or it's not working if it says no

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,710
activity yet it might just be that

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,370
there's no one on your website for them

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,870
to to do the actual dot or gathering so

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,810
it might obviously take time for their

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,970
daughter to be thrown out but if you

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,170
same taste traffic they should come the

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,090
next screen should show you a

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,910
confirmation that the pixel is actually

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,340
integrated okay if there is something

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,590
wrong then it doesn't work the base

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,270
thing is to go to a developer and ask

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,120
them sometimes they have to install the

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:35,680
code manually but most of the time this

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:41,770
this method does work so everyone okay

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:45,190
up till here you guys okay no it's no

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,140
problem basically this is it

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,140
this is our pixel work start integrates

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,090
so after this if everyone's okay then

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,230
we'll just go to the actual ads manager

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,210
and now I'm going to show you how to

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,750
create adverts and how to make it work

00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,370
which is very interesting

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,520
I've actually a little stories we

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:08,740
actually had we have a advert running

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,110
continuously so you can say uploaded

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,900
make it run continuously make it target

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,090
very very specific people like we target

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,100
for example in the past 30 days the

00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,060
people it's been on our website because

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,640
obviously they're looking for something

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,940
so they've been on your website you can

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,100
target them specifically and what's

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,340
great about this Facebook Ads manager is

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,830
that you don't donate all these insane

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,150
like marketing experts telling you this

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,100
and this one telling you this you can

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,070
literally do this by yourself at your

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:46,570
house if you have Wi-Fi it's very very

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:48,610
easy to to manage and it links up to

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,260
your website which makes it such an

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,910
amazing tool because you you can

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,400
literally track people on your website

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,270
and if a page doesn't get any views then

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,060
it's a reason for it

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,670
or for example people are not even

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,110
clicking twice on your site what's wrong

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,730
with my site you know maybe it's too

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,860
cluttered maybe it needs a bit of a

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,560
better design or layout or better

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,670
guidance and so daughter I think you

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,550
guys have probably heard it over the

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,760
years but odds are really is king and

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:21,760
without it you you will struggle okay so

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:24,580
if we go back to Facebook then you'll go

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,010
to your ads manager and then obviously

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,750
it throws out this is quite an intense

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,180
for you don't have to read it so don't

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,550
worry but this is basically what it will

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,070
look like if you've posted quite a few

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,380
posts and you've boosted it it actually

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,010
shows you the delivery whether it's

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,580
active your budget so you can see it's

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:48,130
easier using ad set budgets so there's a

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,130
lot of different things on ad manager

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,870
but I'm going to show you how it works

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,570
but all I'm saying is once your pixel is

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,440
integrated this code will appear at the

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:02,770
top so and that actually means that your

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,980
pixel is linked up and it's working if

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:09,400
that code appears and your facebook

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,230
opens up this ad manager okay I'm gonna

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,090
go through the types of adverts that you

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,160
can create and then we can come back to

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,760
the pixel or we can guide people to set

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,940
it up just now okay so I want you guys

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,210
to go and click on this create button if

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,700
you

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,920
all day so I'm gonna first go through

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,210
the actual ads manager if this doesn't

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,300
work then I'll show you how to do it

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,280
from your Facebook wall maybe I should

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,110
start with that because it's a lot

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,250
easier than this one then we can come to

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:42,970
this one after let me just quickly yeah

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,620
so if you for example or not a huge

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:55,830
company you've got your Facebook page

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:58,830
and you want to sorry let me just go

00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,830
down

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,350
okay so let's say this is your Facebook

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,890
page now okay you can literally create

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:13,170
an advert from just posting a status so

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,910
you can even advertise the status there

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,120
are certain guidelines that Facebook

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,890
expects you to follow a good one for us

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,970
for example is that you can't use more

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:26,070
than 30% of your image cannot be text so

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,320
you can't put sale this big on the image

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,000
and expect Facebook to promote it for

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,010
you they will not they will literally

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,240
run it for like the half an hour that

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,710
it's getting approved and then they'll

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,809
kick it out and say your ad was not

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,760
approved and then if you don't know why

00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,200
they actually guide you so they give you

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,520
like a little link you can go click on

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,679
it and they will tell you exactly why

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,780
they didn't approve your advert so

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,110
that's also quite nice so if you're on

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,620
your Facebook page and you all know the

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,450
testator's button off the status space

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,190
they've actually now recently come out

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,250
with so much fun things that you could

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,710
actually promote and do on Facebook so

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,169
right under your status you'll see check

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,419
in event tickets at a milestone get

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,940
bookings a poll you can even make people

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,460
also questions feeling rights and notes

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,380
tagged a product so this is like also if

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,540
it's integrated with WooCommerce you

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,049
have a product so let's say for example

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,880
for me I put like a host helmet or

00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,590
something they then you can actually tag

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,270
that product when people click on it it

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,790
takes them straight to your website so

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,530
that's actually really mental so if

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,850
people on Facebook they can literally

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,380
click on anything and it'll go straight

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,169
to your website which is where you're

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,360
trying to direct them to so the end this

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,809
is the you can advertise your business

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,059
from here this is very very very simple

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:46,340
and then get messages start a

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:49,669
question-and-answer thing so if you are

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,520
not sure how Facebook Ads manager works

00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:55,080
then you can just use this tool itself

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,320
because at the bottom here you can see

00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,330
boost post and that literally is when

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,910
you push the money in for it to go

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,960
public and they also guide you through

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,000
it so I'm going to guide you guys

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,250
through it the easy way and then I'll go

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
back to Facebook Ads manager and show

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,850
you a little bit more in detail like the

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,000
collaboration that you can do can do

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:21,900
carousels like that scrolls and

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:25,830
go right so if you type or let's say for

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:29,220
example you added a photo now so add a

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,080
photo or type something choose one of

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,420
these things that you would like to do

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,470
even if it's advertise your business so

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,470
click on something

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:49,379
you'll even see that Facebook actually

00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:51,269
gives you tips so yes page tips if

00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:52,889
you've got a business page it'll

00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,719
actually show you write a post to

00:22:52,889 --> 00:23:00,419
connect with your page visitors and

00:22:54,719 --> 00:23:02,009
that's here so if you know friends who

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,320
might like your page you can promote

00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:05,999
your you can actually invite them to

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,339
like a page that's quite a common thing

00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:11,129
to do and then you can even create a

00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:14,729
group for your page so with Facebook's

00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:17,309
new rules about advertising game arts if

00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,919
you have a community so let's you've got

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:21,709
a group built around your page your

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,659
advert is more likely to appear

00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:26,190
everywhere on Facebook basically so they

00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,989
they said okay but if there's a

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,719
community that community obviously wants

00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:32,989
to see that advert so they will rather

00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:35,579
throw out that advert to that community

00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:37,859
then they will if it's a random person

00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:39,690
coming in and there's no community build

00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:42,029
around that page so they focus on that

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,229
now so it is actually a good idea to

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,909
start a group it's just a lot of

00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:47,339
maintenance because obviously people ask

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,559
questions and you might not get members

00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,809
to join so if you've chosen one of those

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,089
activities just do it as a taste for now

00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,529
you don't have to click the final like

00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:57,989
David my account button

00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:02,069
but either write something or add a

00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:04,529
random photo in today I'll guide you all

00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:06,179
the way to the end so that you if you

00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:09,299
want to click on the boost you can but I

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,459
mean yeah so you can literally decide

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,209
what you want to do on Facebook ads

00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:18,599
manager okay this is just a bit of like

00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:22,139
the custom audiences so you'll actually

00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,639
see sorry let me just jump back here I

00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:28,289
want to show you guys the audience

00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:29,999
button okay if you if you click on

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,739
create a new ad where I showed you guys

00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:34,949
here you can click on create a new ad

00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:38,219
it's going to show you yeah this is how

00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:39,509
it starts so it is best to go this route

00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:43,319
because you can choose very very

00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:45,569
specific things so on your main page you

00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,669
can just go to your status add a photo

00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:50,099
and boost the post and choose whoever

00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:51,809
you want to boost it to but if you want

00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:53,609
to create a campaign it's a lot more

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,900
detailed and you can actually decide if

00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:58,570
you have a website that's linked to this

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,700
what you want what's your marketing

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,110
objective if I can put it like that do

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,030
you want to reach as many people as

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,440
possible oh we can actually go through

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:10,330
it so your brand awareness so if you for

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,030
example you can literally only select

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,720
one year you can't select two they only

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:19,840
make you select one which is hard it's

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,790
not that easy but to choose because but

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,530
you can make more than one adds it which

00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,540
is nice so the one can target traffic

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,680
but the other one can just reach as many

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,070
people as possible

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,080
okay so brand awareness is like if you

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,210
want more people to know about you and

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,340
about your specific brand that you have

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,190
for example with clothing and Nike they

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,850
talk to other people who like Nike

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:47,250
obviously okay then reach is different

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:50,260
let's say for example we're having a

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,850
charity event you're not trying to

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,440
target only specific people you're

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,930
trying to target as many people as

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,670
possible to come and donate money so you

00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,010
would then choose reach because you can

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,880
reach the maximum amount of people so

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:07,060
yeah its brand awareness and these reach

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,160
okay then traffic is like this is

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,650
actually the traffic one that I chose so

00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,690
it's actually just seen more people to

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,940
your website so it's driving traffic

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,560
from Facebook to your website and it's

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,240
saying okay that's what everyone wants

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,890
but when you're a bigger company you

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,450
actually want to sell something to

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,420
people so you would more go for the

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,630
conversion one then you get the

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,820
engagement so for example social

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,950
butterfly all she wants is she wants

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,080
people to comment on her post she wants

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,960
people to comment and she and engage as

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,900
much as possible on that post so they'll

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,340
write a really interesting status and

00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,990
they can actually target it for

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,850
engagement so they want people to

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,100
comment they want people to share that

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,820
post as much as possible then you'll

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,770
have to choose engagement okay then app

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,620
installs if anybody is here that writes

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,930
apps you can specifically target people

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,390
so if you have an app you can target

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,760
them if you click on app installs it

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,300
says direct them directly to the app

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,500
store so if your advert pops up and they

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,800
click on learn more

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,930
or shop now or book now it'll take them

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,920
directly to the app store where they can

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,390
download your app okay video views it's

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,450
the same for example if you're

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,860
advertising a squib image but if you're

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,470
advertising your video as well you could

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,670
just click on video views and it'll also

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,130
advertise it the same as any other

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:33,640
advert but it'll just toggle people more

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,860
with the video okay lead generation is

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,340
quite interesting that's actually that

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,380
new but it's more like I actually have

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:47,440
an explanation some way I can show you

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:49,540
guys everyone following along so far a

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,190
little bit least you learning something

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,190
about Facebook if not anything else

00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:59,050
it goes into so much detail that like

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,990
you really have to go and sit with ads

00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,480
manager go through every tab and

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,000
actually read on what it is you can

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,500
actually go to the Facebook business you

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,850
can just Google Facebook business and

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,680
they have a very very amazing Help

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,780
Center and there's actually I got most

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,280
of my screenshots as well so that helps

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,110
seem to actually guide you through

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,270
almost anything that you want to do but

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,370
okay so and then messages for example if

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,100
you want to target people to send you a

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,720
message about a specific topic you can

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,300
also advertise messages I don't know how

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,670
much that actually gets used but you can

00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,200
target people and ask them button that

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,840
pops up they won't be SHOP NOW

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,060
it will be message that makes any sense

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,310
like it's not a shop now or a book now

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:44,130
we'll learn more its message me

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:48,150
okay then conversions is like on

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:50,830
facebook as manager that's like your

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,280
very very intense one if I can put it

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,350
like that

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,780
you basically have to guide people and

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:58,630
then you have to set up a rules or um go

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:04,150
through the sides of it as well and then

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:06,460
you can actually guide people to your

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:13,710
website and you have to actually click

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,710
on you have to actually go to the

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,480
you have to set up rules for example I

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:26,410
want them to check out on my website or

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,050
I want them to add something to the cart

00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,460
so there's a whole list of events on

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,240
your website that you can go and say I

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:37,870
want to con take this advert and convert

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,000
people to check out so if you click on

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,340
conversions it will guide you step by

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,400
step through that as well then catalog

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,650
sales is more like products if you click

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,080
on catalog size cells it'll specifically

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,880
throw out do you it author out something

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,370
like this for example where you can make

00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,950
a carousel or you can have a single

00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:00,160
image a single video slideshow or a

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,890
collection so catalog sales is very very

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,110
product focused if you click on catalog

00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,390
sales it will throw out more

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:16,720
specifically I want to advertise this

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:20,290
product that I just got in okay okay the

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,560
install visits this is like for look for

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:26,560
local store later I have a shop I do in

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,640
Cape Town if I go and advertise for that

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,450
job I don't actually go and target

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,720
didn't sound like she doesn't have a

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,580
website she only has a shop so you want

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,590
people to be able to see the address and

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,750
the location of that shop so you would

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,900
then click on store visits which will

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,910
bring people to your shop so if they see

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,340
that advert they get a little button

00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,110
that actually says get directions and if

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:57,940
they click on that they'll be able to go

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:59,890
to your physical shop okay okay then

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,970
this is just where I wanted to show you

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:07,530
guys a little bit so I clicked here on

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:10,810
traffic and then at the bottom it says

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:13,930
continue if you click on that continue

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:15,700
button then I want to show you online so

00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,700
I'm just trying to get on line then I

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,560
can actually make one but your daily

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,680
budget cannot be less than 10 round but

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,360
tendrÃ¡n is really not a lot so if you

00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,670
can go and sit down for yourself and say

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,570
hey I've got 200 ran a month that I can

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,320
actually spend you can literally

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,809
advertise

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,789
any days a month which is quite a lot

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,279
and if you target people very very

00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,169
specifically you can also even do lowest

00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,529
costs so it says get the most results

00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:44,889
for your budget across ad seats so

00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:47,970
anyone can use Facebook you can also set

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:51,250
a bit cap so you can say for example

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:54,870
when it reaches this amount stop the

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:57,669
advert so if you click on that it'll say

00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:59,259
for example I only want to be able to be

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:01,389
debited with a thousand round I don't

00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,340
want it to go over that so even for the

00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:05,320
bigger companies they also do it so they

00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,750
say for example our ad budget is ten

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,850
thousand Rend so run all these adverts

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,100
but when we reach ten thousand rent stop

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:15,100
it's david us and stop that's our budget

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,799
for the month okay so your actual amount

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,509
spent daily can vary you'll see like

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,389
sometimes they only spend a trend

00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:24,399
something or nine round something but in

00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:26,169
the end that it'll all add up so that it

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:35,110
is that sit around that you're spending

00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:39,490
over three days okay okay so now this is

00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:43,360
a campaign so the next thing it's going

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:45,220
to ask you is to create an audience this

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,470
is very very important you need to be

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:53,440
able to tell them who do you want to see

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,970
your advert basically do you want random

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,889
strangers to see your adverts because

00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,049
it's a charity event and you just want

00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:00,820
anyone with money to come and attend we

00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:02,259
say like a specific target market that

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,590
you have in mind

00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:08,830
you can type a lot of interests into

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:11,710
this but creating the audience you for

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,169
example call it a name so you can for

00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,879
example make an audience for housing but

00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:17,559
you can also make one for North West and

00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:19,539
they can actually be different people's

00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:22,269
interests can different and then when

00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:25,029
you when you make so they call it a

00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:28,539
custom audience when you make an

00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:30,279
audience you can save that audience and

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,409
the next time you use the same audience

00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,210
so for every advert you don't have to

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:36,039
type it all in again like horse-riding

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:41,340
and show jumping in so there's a lot of

00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,340
interest you can target okay

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,630
so the audience is it's very important

00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,170
so give it a name so they had custom

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,840
audiences you can create put a name for

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,340
your audience and then in this everyone

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,220
in this location I just really wish I

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:04,140
can get on the internet let me try again

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:09,990
in everyone's it's very difficult to do

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:12,750
without actually being on Facebook okay

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,970
so in any case if you click on everyone

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,649
in this location it'll give you a

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,080
drop-down and you can actually choose a

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:22,530
location so you can choose like routing

00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,760
or be very very specific for example if

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,050
you're a developer in your based and

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,909
cutting and you only want to work with

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,980
companies in that area you only target

00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,050
that area but you can also target more

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,389
than one area you can also talk at more

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,310
than one country so you can even say

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,350
South Africa and then you can say

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,970
Mozambique or you can say what's one out

00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,580
or you can say as many countries as you

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:47,220
want in there you can even advertise

00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,350
from here in the USA it doesn't matter

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,060
it'll still pick up on people's walls if

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,429
you're targeting a specific person this

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,840
is easy but if you're targeting a bulk

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,960
amount of people you're gonna have to go

00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:00,150
to all of their pages so if it's one

00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,770
person then I would go and look at their

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,390
likes which pages do they like what

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,460
interests because there's truly

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,080
something called interests on Facebook

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,460
right you say like I'm interested in

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,620
music interesting whatever that interest

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,980
is what Facebook takes out and they put

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,170
it in a so if you type they like

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,120
showjumping for me for example if

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,040
anybody does that it pops up on their

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,360
interest and they've said like this is

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,090
what I'm interested in this is what I'm

00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,830
doing so and a lot of people actually

00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,750
don't have that in their profile so this

00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,990
is quite a hard thing like not all of us

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,980
put our interests in Facebook but I

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:40,680
would specifically target the type of

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,300
company that your competitor is and say

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,950
let's say for example is also a

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,840
developer and you're trying to steal

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,240
these clients you'll have to go and see

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,980
what that client is working with by

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,110
going to their Facebook page a lot of

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,280
Facebook stalking but if you do that and

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,350
you target all the people

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,910
do you specifically want you can

00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,550
literally target people in a very very

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,200
small area as well so if it's only

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,650
Janice Berg and you only want this

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,200
radius of people in these specific areas

00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,750
you can do that too like the shop is

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,030
situated in the Perl and I only target

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:15,300
the Pearl and 20 kilometers around that

00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,670
that's it so only people who live in

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,140
that area I get to see that advert no

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,960
one outside of that area can see that

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,430
advert so that's also but your list of

00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,470
interest can be as long as you wanted

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,360
there is almost no limits so you can

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,830
literally everything that person's the

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:34,740
the people are interested in you put it

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:36,300
into interests then the age group for

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,580
example for some of our adverts we only

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,130
target women we don't charge it mean at

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,660
all because I don't buy the product so

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:47,610
then you can literally select men or

00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,530
women and their age age groups and also

00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,360
enter a language but mostly does in

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,130
South Africa it doesn't normally even

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,670
ask you that because it just uses

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:59,040
English as a general language but let's

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,840
say your site is in Afrikaans and you

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,700
want to target Afrikaans speaking people

00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,220
you would literally put the inter

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,930
language Afrikaans and if people type in

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,580
Afrikaans on their Facebook page it'll

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,290
pick that up and it will literally throw

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,450
out your advert - Afrikaans speaking

00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,830
people okay this is where you type in

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,630
the interests it'll ask you for example

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,940
demographics interests or behavior

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,170
detailed targeting you can even exclude

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,230
people if you want to exclude your

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:25,350
competitor you can exclude their page or

00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:30,300
they don't see you after at all and then

00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:33,840
you can give Facebook the authority

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,390
almost to actually go and look for more

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,850
people so they can expand your interest

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,520
when it may increase the link clicks at

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,440
a lower cost per link click so they can

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,700
for example take over a little bit and

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,740
like throw it out to people that you

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,520
might not have thought of but they still

00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,200
keep it at a very low cost okay so this

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,300
is the placement so show your ad to the

00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,950
right people in the right places if

00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,080
you're making a campaign just stick with

00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,760
the recommended automatic placements

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,710
because it does take everything from

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,340
your Facebook page and just applies it

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:07,500
so you don't have to go and edit that in

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,990
your budget and schedule

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,850
you every your daily budget you can even

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,130
go to that and actually choose like a

00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,619
weekly budget or a monthly budget that

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,710
you want to run it on and the actual

00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:24,359
amount spend and then see the start and

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:26,280
end date so if you click on that it'll

00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,380
actually give you like start on they say

00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,930
for example today and then end on Sunday

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,400
so that you add only runs for those

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,380
three days and it literally only Davis

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,220
you for that that amount of time it

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,200
won't stay with you more you can also

00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,880
start a continuous ad see for example

00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,190
with Google ads you can have an ad

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,480
running for hundred grand a day and with

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:50,820
Facebook ads and then just for the rest

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,650
until you stop it so it can literally

00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,480
just keep running and debates your mount

00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,970
your account with the same amount every

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,890
month so yeah you can actually see the

00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,410
custom audiences so if you've created an

00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,970
audience in the Facebook Ads manager

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,850
it'll throw it out so WordPress users in

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,950
Ha Tinh for example and yes all the

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,700
interests so you can go and target

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:13,859
specifically like web developer

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,720
WordPress developer everything that you

00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,119
think is an interest to your target

00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:24,660
market go type it in there where it said

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:26,700
interest in the slide okay so you can

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,560
also on Facebook itself if you're on the

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,990
page you can also click on promote

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,540
website and it'll actually promote your

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,970
website for you it'll throw out the same

00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,850
type of block and it will guide you

00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:41,850
through all the steps so Facebook throws

00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:45,890
out a lot of like tips like this for

00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:48,720
example that you can actually just use

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:51,900
so if you guys go to your Facebook Ads

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,800
manager and click on create ad and then

00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,390
from there we see if we can at least get

00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,580
something that is there anybody still

00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:04,590
struggling with the pixel that needs

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:07,230
help no one basically this is WordPress

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:11,710
by its based and it's got WooCommerce on

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:14,290
it and then we just saw

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:17,440
of products so the moment you can see

00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,970
this like a pink cell going on and what

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,550
we will actually do is we would take the

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,589
exact same image that's on our homepage

00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,869
put it on Facebook Ads manager and make

00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:27,520
it run with a shop now button and then

00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:31,690
when people click on that it's nice if

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,970
they can see the link so if you do

00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,430
something on on Facebook Ads manager its

00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,290
base to when you click when you use the

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,570
shop now button it asks you for the URL

00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,869
for this website don't just put your

00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,760
homepage if you're advertising a product

00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:47,410
try and add the URL that takes them

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,240
directly to that product otherwise have

00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,220
to navigate your site so you've already

00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,500
lost them before you've even got gained

00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,520
them so for example if I had to

00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:00,730
advertise a product like this cap but I

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,310
would literally take them to that exact

00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:07,390
product on the website so that we can

00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,980
you can take and directly literally all

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,480
they have to do is add to cart or choose

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,940
their size and color and add it to the

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,820
cart that's the probably the best way of

00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,339
advertising then I want to show you guys

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:24,040
a bit of a custom conversions that you

00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:25,750
can do with this so basically if you've

00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:31,089
like installed and activated this

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:33,820
plug-in and just go back to this if

00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:37,480
you've actually if you've activated the

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:42,040
plug-in that we did it actually links up

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,750
with Facebook with that code don't stand

00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,300
so it it puts that plug-in on your

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,820
website and then runs it so you actually

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,520
if you like if you are here I have

00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,140
activated this plugin it'll actually

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,410
throw out more steps for you to like

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,200
link the site probably properly but it

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:02,170
depends if you have a product page

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:06,160
product based website then it it links

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:08,349
up with a with the products so you can

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,000
actually then say like oh this is a

00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:12,849
product based website or this is a

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,950
service based website and then it takes

00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,570
you further it's very very difficult to

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,290
get screenshots of that we've had a

00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,650
Google Ads

00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,330
advert run now for a few months which

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,180
basically just puts us at the top there

00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,390
which is Google Ads but if I have to if

00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,130
you

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,690
to think for yourself when you google

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:32,829
something with you look do you look at

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,269
the first two adverts no you scroll down

00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:36,489
and you actually look for the link that

00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:38,470
is more applicable to you so if you

00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:40,960
google something and the first two sees

00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,640
ads next to it I don't actually will

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,289
ever click on those links so we've

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,329
actually almost seen no results from the

00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:48,309
Google ads that we've run whereas with

00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:52,480
Facebook Ads manager I can honestly tell

00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:54,789
you that there's a company or a place

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,009
called Ponyville next to the river they

00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,839
built some guest houses they literally

00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:01,029
brought the guest houses out of the

00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:03,400
whole building like budget they're in

00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:04,839
the raid out of the raid into the green

00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,599
in three months with Facebook Ads

00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:09,789
manager because you can target very very

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,829
specific people and demographics and

00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:13,269
target that area or target how thing

00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:14,440
because no one's gonna fly from Cape

00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:15,700
Town to come sleep next to the wall

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,119
River if you live in Cape Town

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:21,309
so the obviously target people in a

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,730
different way but they literally brought

00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:25,210
their their whole business out of the

00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,190
raid

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,910
just with Facebook Ads manager by

00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:32,529
targeting people very very specifically

00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,089
so personally I haven't had a good

00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:36,460
experience with Google Ads that's the

00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:38,739
truth with Facebook Ads manager we've

00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,539
had our asset run continuously is

00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:45,119
literally continuously our top seller

00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:45,119
