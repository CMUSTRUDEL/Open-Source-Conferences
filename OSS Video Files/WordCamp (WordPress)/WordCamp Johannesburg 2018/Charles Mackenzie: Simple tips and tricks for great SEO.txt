basically the plan for this afternoon

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:10,070
I'll introduce myself briefly is we're

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,420
gonna do 50 minutes of some basic theory

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,809
groundwork just get everyone on the same

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,640
page when it comes to what SEO is how it

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,949
works why we do it

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,010
those sorts of things and then we're

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,210
gonna have 40 minutes of I'm going to

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,779
come and help you answer questions

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,640
queries you can look at things things

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,960
you might not understand there's a

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,940
couple of different areas that we can

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,130
look at but we're really just going to

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,630
try and make it work for for you guys

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,149
and trying to address the problems that

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,559
you have so if you can bear with me for

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,300
15 minutes we're gonna go through quite

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,850
a few slides hopefully they're

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,200
entertaining and then we can break up

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,200
and do some things a little bit more

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,090
practical my name is Charles I am a

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,399
digital strategist at a company called

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,390
flick leap I recently just finished

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,160
doing my masters in digital advertising

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,680
digital marketing which I think I

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,820
finished last week so I'm still

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,270
recovering from that one thank you I

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,380
appreciate that so I think I know one

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,659
two things about what I'm talking about

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,840
if I am wrong why I say something in

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:21,540
creates please just tell me otherwise so

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,090
let's get going there we go

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,340
all right so an overview of search

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,619
engine marketing so search engine

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,270
marketing is pretty much anything to do

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,509
with advertising or marketing through

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,939
search engines so there's two or three

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,950
main categories you've got paid search

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,070
which is where you paying to put your

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,920
adverts into a search page set of

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,049
results then you've got local SEO so

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,390
that's things that help you find things

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,000
that are close to you so Google Maps for

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,649
instance or ways or things like that if

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
they show an ad or do something that's

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,390
local SEO you're trying to find

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,250
something that's right where you are or

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,740
where your company is and then you have

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,740
search engine optimization and that's

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,379
broken up into two sub components so the

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,420
one is called on-page and that's all the

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,770
technical boring stuff about have you

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,330
started

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,950
da da jars crushed two T's put

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,140
everything that you can put in place in

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,940
the right place and that's on your

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,510
website so it's completely within your

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,900
control

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,910
off page SEO is a whole nother animal

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,730
that's everything that happens off your

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,350
website but points into your website and

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,820
I'll explain a little bit more about

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,340
that as we go so here's an example it's

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,440
quite a nice one of all the different

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,690
components at the very top you can see

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,270
there's an ad so I switch to Kia

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,910
Branston so we've got a paid search ad

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,460
up at the top here then below that we

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,630
have an organic results so this is not

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:58,320
paid for and that's the actual website

00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:01,500
below that is a car coz a website so

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,110
this is an off page SEO someone else is

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,480
linking to their website so it's not on

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,370
their website their website this is Kia

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,250
Bronston this is something else but it

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,140
points to their website and then on the

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,240
right-hand side here so this is

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,030
obviously for desktop you can see it

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,500
says Kia Bronston so this is some

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,510
pictures if you want to get directions

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,150
some reviews around the branch and a

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,690
couple other different things you know

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,690
one happy

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:32,510
you've probably seen this before maybe

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,950
once twice in your lifetime cool so

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,870
here's an introduction the first thing

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,240
you need to know is who's who when it

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,310
comes to search engines the short answer

00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:52,670
is everyone uses Google and forget the

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:56,640
rest right why is it important so SEO is

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,310
all about trying to get your website to

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,290
be optimized or ready or in the best

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,480
possible shape for a search engine to

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,220
come and find you and the better you can

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,470
do that the more you can optimize it the

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,750
better you will come up in search engine

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,370
results so people are searching for

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,980
things all the time

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,990
stats are people use their phones 200

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,130
times a day so people are always picking

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,870
up their phone and they're always

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,330
searching for something all the time it

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,830
never stops if you had a bryce someone

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,419
says something silly you like well we

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,340
should research that what do you do take

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,480
out your phone and you search for it it

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,820
it's

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,040
part of what we do I think one of the

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,420
things that we find with SEO and web

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,090
sites and those sorts of things as

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,360
people don't even realize how much they

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,320
do this you do this all day I'm gonna

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,730
say something

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
where you're gonna see something and

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,250
you're gonna go like hey I wonder about

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,870
that there might be like a shiny object

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,460
someone's probably going hey there's a

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,900
pot plant where do you get pot plants

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,790
for your house that's going to happen

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,400
during the course of today you do it all

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,980
the time and so you to get this right

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,450
is quite important for your business

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,950
I've changed some people at lunch and

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,830
we're saying you know one of the nice

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,050
things about SEO is that when the ads

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,500
stop you start paying for your budget

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,760
your SEO still runs and and you don't

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,270
have to pay for it so that's also very

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,210
nice so the key thing here is where you

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,340
come up in the results stats are that if

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,320
you come up number come up first you're

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,690
going to get 38% of the clicks on

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,840
average then roughly half of that for

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,450
second place and then some results it

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,220
halves again almost but it's 11% in your

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,200
third result and here's the most

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,290
important one if you're on the top of

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,140
the second page you're going to get 2%

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,750
of all the click throughs it's a very

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,850
old a very bad joke that I tell all the

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,000
time where do you hide a dead body on

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,870
the second page of Google because no one

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,880
is looking there

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,120
so there's the important thing that you

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,920
need to know is you need to be hopefully

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,690
in the top three results beyond that

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,620
you're not going to get too much love

00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:02,280
from your search engine results and also

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,520
just to bear in mind if we go back to

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,920
this example this is map this is a

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,700
screenshot of my computer screen you've

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,110
got an ad so that's at the top then we

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,720
have the first result and then we have

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,760
the second result if you were in third

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,280
place you don't even come up on the home

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,660
page of my screen you've got I've got to

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,490
scroll down to get to number three

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,750
forget number ten number ten would be

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,160
like in the parking lot okay cool so how

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,770
does search engines work before we get

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,850
completely and horribly distracted

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,860
there's three things that happen the

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,360
first thing is google stands out what

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,190
they call the Google BOTS and it goes

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,729
all over the internet and it finds

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,749
things it's just like well a crawling

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,430
b-but it goes around trying to find

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:47,259
stuff and literally what it does is it

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,580
goes from one link and then a ghost

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,990
their page and if their links on that

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,090
page then it clicks through all of those

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,949
links and goes to another link make

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,870
sense and then it just bounces around

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,479
and starts off until the traffic tries

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,189
to find everything then once they've

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,469
gone and they've crawled all the

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,449
websites that they can find they then go

00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,370
and index them so it's a little bit like

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,900
a library where they've just got cards

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,270
for days and these are all the different

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,789
things and that's what they say and then

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,999
this is the real magic of it you go and

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,339
search for something how high is it to

00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,539
space it's four kilometres in case

00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:26,560
you're wondering I've got a horribly

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:28,870
wrong and I'm distracting myself they're

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,479
going to show you the search results so

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,189
they crawl everything then they order it

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,930
and sequence it they call an indexing

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,580
and then when you want to look for it

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,830
they come and serve you with the results

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:44,889
that they find are most relevant to what

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:48,279
you are searching for there's rumor of

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:52,479
this mysterious 200 factors that Google

00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:54,129
uses to rank things the reality is is

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,520
that no one actually knows it's Google's

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,870
proprietary special secret magic mystery

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,029
thing that they use to make lots and

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,219
lots of money that only people know they

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,319
don't tell you because if you know you

00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:07,389
can then find a way around it to cheat

00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,129
and they don't want you to cheat because

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,589
they want people to trust it which is

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,529
something I'll talk about in a bit so no

00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:16,539
one knows so if you heard of 200 factors

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,490
or any of those sorts of things I just

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,520
like to use the quote from Pirates of

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,529
the Caribbean where they say that there

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,529
are more the code is more what you'd

00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:29,379
call guidelines and actual rules no one

00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,849
actually knows people have ideas there

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,630
are lots of commentators with lots of

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:41,930
theories but no one really knows so when

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:44,540
people want kittens we give them puppies

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,400
in my head sounds silly but this is

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,450
really the crux of the entire search

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,760
engine industry and if you have a look I

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,470
typed in I actually had to go and do

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,160
some photoshop skills here we'll be very

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,040
proud of me

00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,330
all right kittens at the top there but

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,480
then I took the search results page for

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,640
puppies if you wanted a kitten and you

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,290
typed kittens into Google and they gave

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,520
you puppies what would you think of

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,200
Google they're not switched on they

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,390
don't know what they're doing are you

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,440
gonna go back and use this again if this

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:21,370
is the results you keep getting no

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,800
you're not so this is what Google does

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,680
when people won't want kittens Google

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,750
gives you kittens and you can see this

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,920
and I don't know somehow that puppies

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:37,120
snuck in there because there's a kitten

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:39,320
but anyway it's a little cheeky doesn't

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,630
so that's what they do they give you

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,600
what you want so if any if you take

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,720
anything out of today forget everything

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,900
else I say please just remember this one

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,360
simple thing people are happy when they

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,630
find what they are searching for you are

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,760
a person apply this to yourself happy

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,280
people will come back to Google because

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,380
they know that they will find what

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,990
they're searching for yes

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,020
everyone with me so far okay cool if

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,960
people keep coming back to Google Google

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,640
can auction ad space and earn revenue so

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,640
they make money if you keep coming back

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,130
and then lastly the higher the number of

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,490
people using Google the more value their

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,500
ad space so there's a reason why Google

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,270
sells more advertising space than any

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,130
other company in the world by quite a

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,410
large factor and it's because they're

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,830
very good at giving you what you want so

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,330
the short answer is happy people means

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:40,580
happy Google so if you have a website or

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,890
an online store or anything that's on

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,550
the Internet you want to make people

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,460
happy

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:51,950
if you make people happy you will make

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:54,640
Google happy make sense so with all the

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,860
rules and the ideas and the coding

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
the tips and the layouts and the listen

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:04,540
of that and the funky metadata

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,380
oh goodness funky metadata just make

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,690
people happy

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:12,880
what is your page about what is your

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,650
website about use those words if someone

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,430
is looking for you what words would they

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,370
use use those words make sense because

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,360
if that's what someone's looking for

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,520
Google's going to go through your site

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,080
and say hey this is what they're looking

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,630
for and they're going to match you up

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,660
and you're gonna you're gonna get people

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,570
who want what you have

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,850
so I know it seems overly simplistic but

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,640
if you can use this one thing as a guide

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,380
for everything else you do you should

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,850
get pretty good traction and pretty good

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:48,370
results happy can ask questions I'm

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,410
afraid and it's they're going to

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,320
distract me Herbie and yes I don't want

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,390
them alright so there's two sides to

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,050
this we said there's on-page SEO and

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:03,460
there's off page SEO and we're going to

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:05,830
go through the two different types so

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:10,020
say all the right things and that's on

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:12,370
your website so if you've got a page

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,500
what is that page about what are you

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,050
trying to achieve what who you trying to

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,450
reach write down the words

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,330
what is this page about this page is

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,240
about I'll see how one example writing a

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,150
blog so if it's about writing a blog use

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,490
the word blog and how to write a blog

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,890
and then use that consistently

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,650
throughout the whole page so don't go

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,600
and change from blog to article or to

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,910
story or to use other words and swap

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,550
them out because now you diluting what

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,540
it's about whatever it's about just make

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,300
it about that one thing keep it simple

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,720
all right so here's an example of a page

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:58,300
so in the title tag up at the top it

00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:01,600
says blog SEO 101 then in the URL it

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,390
says blog SEO 101 you guys seeing a

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,120
theme here hopefully you are in the meta

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,440
description I'll show you how to do this

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,060
later if you don't know how to do it

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,970
you can't see it on the front it's in

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,430
the back it says take a look at some

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,990
basic blog SEO tips that will help you

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,140
get your articles higher ranked on

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,810
search engine page search engine result

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:27,430
pages and therefore more widely read so

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:31,480
that says it's your blog cool in the h1

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:35,560
tag the first heading it says blog is

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,630
hero 101 alt tag so that's because

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,340
Google can't read pictures or see

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,270
pictures it reads the text behind it

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,880
we've labeled this picture as a blog is

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,010
your picture then we've got other

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,980
headings that refer to it and then in

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:57,100
the body the actual text to the page we

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:59,440
refer to blog and SEO there's no

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,210
confusion what this page is about when

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,550
Google goes and has a look at this page

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,230
there is no way on earth they could miss

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,320
the fact that we are talking about blog

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,000
easier it's nice and simple it's

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,450
consistently applied through everything

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,950
and if you're a user you can read the

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,740
title and you know what this page is

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,210
about you can read the URL and you know

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,580
what this page is about you can read the

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,290
heading you can read the text you can

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,000
look at the image doesn't matter where

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,300
you go you know what it's about it's

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,640
easy to use so hopefully people who read

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,660
this are happy and the people are happy

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,160
Google's gonna be happy make sense we

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,540
can't make these slides available so

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,020
don't worry too much about making too

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,730
many notes if you need to cool so a

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,900
couple of tips that we picked up along

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,310
the way use your company name as text

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,140
this might sound a bit strange

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:54,310
but there are a lot of companies out

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,960
there whose logo is a picture and then

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,050
they go and put the picture everywhere

00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,360
on their website but Google can't read

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,550
pictures so what happens when google

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,339
goes through the page is your company

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,260
name is not mentioned once this often

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,030
happens on home pages because you've got

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,339
like this big picture of your logo in

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,250
the middle and then you say we are all

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:17,260
about supers fast service and wonderful

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,500
results and a whole bunch of other thing

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,550
we started in 1922 or something but you

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,270
never go and say the name of your

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,640
company

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,560
so if Google reads a page how am I gonna

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,330
know hurts about your company put your

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,130
name in there write it down

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:36,670
cool then use re redirects okay so if

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,910
you don't know if you've got the www in

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,500
front and you don't have the www in

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,830
front

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,830
Google sees that as two websites Google

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,780
hates doubles or duplicates because now

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,200
they don't know what to do do I send

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:57,430
people to wwo or do I send people to non

00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,310
WW make sense they don't know where to

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,290
go they don't like you can you just

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,060
choose one and then they're happy

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,940
because they're like okay so you want

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,370
everyone from here to go today it

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,580
doesn't matter which one you use just

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,140
have one make sense general rule of

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,720
thumb it's got this the same sort of

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,180
thing happens with canonical pages

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,570
you've got two products in two different

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,880
categories just have one that gets

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,630
pointed to because otherwise they don't

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,640
know what to do

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,930
Google doesn't like confusion they want

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,760
people to be happy and they want them to

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,870
get the best result they don't want to

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,550
have to choose have an SSL certificate I

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,230
don't know if you've seen but some

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,140
browsers now actually have like a little

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,460
not secure thing that comes up that

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,140
doesn't really make people happy when

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,560
they go to your website and bra and the

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,840
browser is not secure so up you it's

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,090
also good for your search results Google

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,910
is very big on mobile

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,680
most people we speak to don't think

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,750
about mobile their design um they went

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,190
on the desktop computer they test it on

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,050
their desktop computer they show their

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,790
clients it on the desktop computer the

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,339
client checks it on the desktop computer

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,650
and 75% of the users are going on their

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,510
phone

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,400
take your desktop and kick it in the bin

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,510
and take your phone out and start

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,610
testing stuff because that's where

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,990
people are and Google ranks you on your

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,130
mobile friendliness and they've got a

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,910
whole bunch of cool tools to help you

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:24,880
with that so don't forget that page load

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,950
speed again happy people happy Google if

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,810
your website takes 30 seconds to load

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,770
Google is going to say I don't want to

00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,350
send people there because they're going

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,890
to have a bad experience so make your

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,890
website fast

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,539
your website to Google search console

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,220
show you how to do that submit your

00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,769
sitemap to Google I'll show you how to

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,870
do that just one thing just to bear in

00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:47,570
mind there's almost like a misnomer

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,460
around the internet it's almost like if

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,789
I make a website and I put it on the

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,429
Internet people will find me

00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:58,070
no they won't no one knows and probably

00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,470
no one will care until you make them

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,470
care and you make them know it's the

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,370
equivalent of going and building a Gucci

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:10,549
store in the middle of Mulder's drift or

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,909
somewhere in the bush if people don't go

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,350
there you've got no one in your store

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,669
you have to get people there you have to

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,309
tell them that they exist and the

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,960
easiest way to do that is just to tell

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:22,700
Google that you exist just put your hand

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,279
up and say hey Google I have a website

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,299
come and crawl it they will find it

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,919
eventually because they've got that

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,929
little bot that crawls around everywhere

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,940
but you don't want to have to wait three

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,710
four months for Google to find you as

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,080
soon as your website's up just go say

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,080
hey here we are

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,090
make sense I am using strong any motive

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,500
language so please do not be too

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,120
offended with me if you use a desktop

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,629
computer or you don't any of these

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,360
things I am just trying to make a point

00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:52,120
then there are some cool things don't

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,480
worry too much about this when it loads

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:59,059
where you can tell google specifics so

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,120
if you have a recipe there's a whole

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,789
library around that says well this is

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,500
the recipe title and this is the

00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,330
ingredients that are used and then when

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,710
google searches it you've probably seen

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,269
this like these things pop up and it

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,549
says like all this like extra

00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:16,279
information in the search bar it's

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:19,129
called all right this is not even that

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,620
that's another slide I just saw code and

00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:26,450
went off on a tangent that one called

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:28,129
micro tagging so this one is a movie so

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,659
you go and say well this is the name of

00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:31,340
the movie and that's the description of

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:33,830
the movie and this is where the movies

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,480
showing and that's the cinema number

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,429
it's on and you're going to put all this

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,830
extra information into it and you give

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,799
it like these little tags and then those

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:49,090
tags tell Google a little bit more about

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:52,690
what it is it's called schema is ch you

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,760
a dog there are libraries for days about

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,390
what you can and cannot do and all that

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,580
kind of thing

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,890
if you do have very detailed information

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,470
these are really worth having a look at

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,330
but they are a little bit more advanced

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,910
another nice thing to do is called

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,550
social recognition is you actually on

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,490
your website you tell Google that you

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,530
have social platforms so I think we once

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,790
had a website where there was a company

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,190
with a similar name and they had a

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,830
Facebook page in Brazil and every time

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,390
you search for the company they this

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,580
Facebook page for another company in

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,980
Brazil would come up and their website

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,630
was quite good-looking and the Brazilian

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,810
social profile was quite not

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,940
good-looking and so this is a way that

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,980
you can say hey Google here's my

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,600
Facebook page or my Twitter page or my

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,490
Instagram page or any of those sorts of

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,010
things it's just a nice way of giving

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,630
them a little bit more information like

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,240
I said we can give you all of this you'd

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,750
have to write it all that some tags so I

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,880
mentioned canonical or duplicated

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,190
content literally what it means is you

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,740
have it in two places and you just tell

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:00,360
Google just use this one again they

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,490
don't like doubles they just want one

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,610
noindex tags basically say don't read

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,700
this page so if you got a test site tell

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,310
Google not to index it okay okay funny

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,690
story we don't know he would work for

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,910
some company a little while ago and

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,010
their hosting company for some reason

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,920
took a snapshot of their website and

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,350
then hosted it on some weird subdomain

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,120
and then what happened it got indexed by

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,640
Google and people started going to their

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,220
website and they kept phoning us and

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,320
saying people are filling out forms with

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,850
pricing from two years ago and we're

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
telling them the prices are wrong and

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,360
that they have to pay more and the

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,550
people are saying no it's on your

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,230
website and we're like what every like

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,270
we have no idea what it's going on we

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,860
can't find this thing anyway then he

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,510
goes and finds out that actually there

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,160
was this whole other website that the

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,170
hosting company had created the people

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,640
were finding filling out the form and

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,510
then trying to pay fees from two years

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,310
ago so this one's quite hopeful for

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,440
testing pages you could choose your

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,640
language so that's kind of helpful

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,860
especially if you've got multiple

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,080
languages on your website so in

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,299
afrikaans really fringe for everybody

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,799
and then you can also just tell them who

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,120
you are so if it's you do a lot of

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
content like you can tell them that

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,240
you're a publisher giving some

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,130
information you've got all these little

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,360
extra things you can add in just to give

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,970
Google bit more information about who

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,670
you are it is more advanced stuff you

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,820
don't normally need to do this ok cool

00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,200
things to avoid so I did say please pay

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,630
attention for 15 minutes because I'm

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,230
going to talk about a whole lot of stuff

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:35,500
so bear with me we're doing well good

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,780
stuff alright so keyword stuffing don't

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,640
go and use keywords as many times as you

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,080
can use the word keyword as because you

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,250
want to get as many keywords into one

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,419
sentence because then the lots of

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,380
keywords are there for people to read

00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:49,419
because you want them to read the

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:50,950
keyword no one reads that people give

00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,870
make people happy

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,610
give them language that they understand

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,320
don't go and stuff stuff in there

00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,480
because you think if you use the word

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,370
lots and lots of times Google go look

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,160
they used the word ten times that must

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,330
be the website we must send people to

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,280
know is it relevant

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,590
does it add value is it people going to

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,330
find it interesting Google's not just

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,490
sending people to places where they

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,250
think there's lots of information they

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,380
want to be relevant because remember you

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,840
were searching for kittens and if Google

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,120
sends you somewhere and has puppies you

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,250
don't like Google Google wants you to

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,890
find what you're looking for so don't go

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,179
and try stuff things in there hidden

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,280
text is something from the old days

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,700
basically you go write a whole bunch of

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,730
things in white font on a white page so

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,299
you can't see it but the words are there

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,169
Google's on to you

00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:43,360
don't do that cloaking it's when you a

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,240
little bit more advanced you get your

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,460
website to show one page to the search

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,040
engine BOTS and then you swap it up with

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,250
something else when the people come it's

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,370
like

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,580
bait and switch Google's on to you don't

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,590
do that either sneaky redirects so this

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,090
one's like you get someone to go to your

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,880
page and as they get to your page you

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,280
send them somewhere else don't do that

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,450
either again Google wants people to find

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,799
what they're looking for that I don't

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,270
want them to go to a page and then get

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,590
sent somewhere else to see something

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:16,659
they shouldn't poor or fake content

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:19,509
there's lots of fake content and the

00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:21,970
news at the moment don't do that

00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:24,519
automate automatically generated content

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,039
again not helpful don't try and be too

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,029
clear about this spamming comments

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,859
backlink farming or link schemes so

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:38,460
you've probably got an email from

00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:41,739
someone from another country in Asia

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,259
India where they said hi I saw your

00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:46,409
great article if you put my article on

00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:48,909
your website I'll put you on my website

00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:51,159
it's it's basically what you're trying

00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:52,779
to do is trying to create links for the

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,659
sake you creating links it's not

00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:57,509
actually helpful so that was everything

00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,070
about what you can do on your website

00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,779
there's no reason for you not to get

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,999
full marks for what you can do on your

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:06,700
website because it's completely within

00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:10,509
your control things that happen outside

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,789
of your website not so much control over

00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,489
because someone else could put your link

00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,080
onto another website recently I was

00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,450
going through backlinks to our website

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,899
and I found another website with their

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,629
head copied our website with a link to

00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:28,090
our website we can't do anything about

00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:31,539
that I mean they it's somewhere else on

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:34,299
the internet and design we can do other

00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:36,909
than buying as many domain names as

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,099
possible but so outside you don't have

00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:41,320
too much control on your website you do

00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:43,330
have control so do you take time to try

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,840
to get that right but you'll see this is

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:49,119
also quite important so Google invented

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,059
something called page rank basically

00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,950
it's a large interconnected system where

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,580
everyone points to everyone else and

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,099
everyone else's rankings give you weight

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,590
based on what everyone else says so it

00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:05,940
constantly updates and changes but

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:10,239
effectively what it boils down to is

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,070
references so the example I like to use

00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,629
if I went for a job interview and I had

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,139
a letter of reference from my old boss

00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:19,059
and I later reference from my mom the

00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:20,499
person who's interviewed be interviewing

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,539
me would say well the one from your boss

00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,669
has probably got more authority it's got

00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,830
more value more weight behind it the one

00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:29,349
from your mom that's quite sweet and

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,280
nice but I'm not really gonna put too

00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,410
much

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,110
credits into what your mom says make

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,870
sense and Google does the same thing so

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:41,890
if there's a website up there that's got

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:46,990
a lot of authority or Mars calls it

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:49,900
domain domain authority then they'll say

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,390
well if they're pointing to you then you

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,030
must also have authority does that make

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,370
sense so if my boss would recommend me

00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,670
and my boss has authority then I must

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,040
have authority because my boss said I do

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:06,370
make sense and basically that's how most

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,890
of it works so maybe the best way to

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:12,670
explain this is an example we had a

00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:16,840
client they are tertiary education and

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:19,150
they registered as cfa don't if you've

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,920
heard of cfa institute in america child

00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,490
a financial analyst it's a very big

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:27,430
program is similar to CAS and they will

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:30,880
be registered as certified trainers for

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:33,250
the CFA Institute in South Africa when

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,250
that happened the CFA Institute put a

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:39,670
link on their website to this

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:42,370
institutions website as an accredited

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,500
partner you guys got me see if an

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,610
Institute puts a link to these guys on

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:52,780
their website the moment that happened

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:55,210
our clients search engine results all of

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,300
them went up because all of a sudden

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,220
they had this naughty badge or this vote

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,130
of confidence from a very large

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,200
well-known very big public American

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,320
organization does that make sense so

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,400
like that Authority got transferred down

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,220
to them all right make sense okay cool

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,750
I'm getting nods so this is good and

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,170
that's pretty much how it works so

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,870
google assesses your website based on

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:25,660
the other websites that point in to your

00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,090
website and you can actually track and

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,100
see all the websites that point in to

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,690
your website and you can you just you

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,880
can see how they are you tracking from

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,940
that point of view they call that a

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,240
backlink so it's a link back to your

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,940
website from another website that link

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,870
that points in so what happened in the

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,840
old days every

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,850
got as many links as I possibly could

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,250
and that's where that link farming thing

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,930
came in they're just gonna make websites

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,520
for days that just had links pointing

00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,100
into your website because Google is just

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,080
counting the number the number nowadays

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,020
doesn't help you so much it's more about

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,430
the quality so Google actually assesses

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,860
they go have a look at that link and say

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,860
are these guys any good yes or no if

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:12,960
they're good okay and then they pass it

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:16,600
on to yourself you guys following me so

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,000
do you if you have an agency or you make

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,440
websites for other people put a link at

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,860
the bottom of your website

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,410
no do you put a link on every website

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:29,520
that you make in the footer to your

00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:32,110
website do you do that anyone done that

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,960
okay you've just gone and put your

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,780
website on to a whole bunch of other

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,840
websites that are completely irrelevant

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:43,000
to your website so now you've got lots

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,450
of links but they've got nothing to do

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,929
with you and unfortunately with this new

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:53,220
algorithm that came in from Google they

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:56,410
now say oh your websites out there but

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,070
if I have a range of clients so maybe

00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,590
it's a vet

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,090
for instance what is your website you're

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,790
an agency what have you got to do with

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,800
of it nothing why do you have that

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,300
pointing in to you and actually what it

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,460
looks like you're doing is link forming

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,540
because now you put your website onto a

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,110
whole bunch of things that are nice to

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,490
do with you so you can keep it there but

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,100
then you need to add that little no

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,920
index tag that says to Google don't

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:24,790
exactly know follow don't don't give me

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,400
any credit or take it off but just

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,050
something - we noticed that all of a

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,920
sudden our results just tanked and we

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,330
were like what happened and the

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,490
radiant's and found out that actually we

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,020
had just shot ourselves in the foot so

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,580
one other things we'll talk about is

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,440
backlink strategies how do you go about

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,720
getting they actually so it's called

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,730
link juice so what happens is you got

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,280
all these other websites up honestly

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,770
people in the digital domain come up

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,450
with the craziest names for things why

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,490
could we have like simple names like

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,370
link juice I was turning to someone at

00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:57,170
lunch about a monkey bottle something

00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:01,580
like no one can name I think

00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:03,650
SEO tool called screaming frog like it's

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,140
a legitimate business screaming frog

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,580
anyway I don't know you come up like I

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,850
think it's like a competition do you can

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,170
look this sound the silliest anyway

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,720
that's a little personal thing don't ma

00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,850
me all right so all these different cups

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,530
represent other websites and then what

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,650
happens is that juice passes through

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:25,520
down to your website so a great way if

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,610
you're struggling to get your to get

00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,620
good traction from your SEO or the

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:33,680
content that you have is a press release

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,550
because news agencies have very very

00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,780
good domain or link juice because

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,940
they've got a very big cap they've got

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,830
lots of followers so if you can get an

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,250
article on their website that links to

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:49,400
your website that's all that good good

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,790
link juice passes down to you it's also

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,130
if you get some bad press so we've had

00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:57,020
one or two people where a new story gets

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,760
out that's not good for them or whatever

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,530
it is and now whenever you search for

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,720
them that comes right up at the top how

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,120
do you compete with that well go to a

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,830
newspaper and pay them a little bit of

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,230
money they can run an article about you

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,890
and then you can try and push those

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,650
results up if that ever happens hope

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,390
never so this is the second time I've

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,300
done this talk I'll show you into some

00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,780
of my sneakiness we did this talk at a

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
meet-up

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,480
earlier in the year if you don't know

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,130
about WordPress meetup so I highly

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,230
recommend you join they happen once a

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,700
month and it's a great a good place for

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,530
you to come and meet like-minded people

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,300
like yourselves and there's some really

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,550
good topics it's spoken about whole

00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,270
range of excellent people come and speak

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,680
at them I was one of them and it's also

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,510
a really nice place just to find out how

00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,290
things are going and using the industry

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,920
all that kind of stuff

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:49,190
it's called meetup WordPress so we were

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,050
doing a talk on SEO so I gave my little

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,830
description about what is and I put a

00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:58,550
link to our website in there and then

00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:00,340
guess what Google picked it up so how do

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,660
we track its I'll show you search cool

00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,400
well this is the old search console

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,290
Google's now made a new search console

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,290
or they're in the process of making it

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,030
they're like halfway in between the two

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:15,500
so it can't really read it yet but

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:18,080
meet up so we were sneaky we went to got

00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,080
our website on another website and

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,550
meetups are pretty good website so then

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,900
they linkjuice started coming through to

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:28,790
us just so think about it what can you

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,280
do to get your website and again

00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:34,370
relevance is key so we're talking about

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,960
SEO so this is all about SEO and this is

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,740
all about SEO and that links through to

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,030
us and we do SEO so it's relevant this

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,290
was the nice one I was really proud of

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:47,750
myself for this case you're wondering

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:49,880
cool so Google has a couple of

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:54,430
algorithms I called it the birds and

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:58,730
bees they've got penguin panda

00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:00,200
hummingbird and pigeon it's just

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,030
basically updates I've made over the

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,710
years basically what's happened is over

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,930
the years people have come up with ways

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,010
to try and circumvent how Google does

00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,740
things to try and get themselves

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,659
artificially higher in the results when

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,950
that happens Google works at art they

00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,350
release a new algorithm will do

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,210
something to make it better and that's

00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,550
why when I talk about relevance I think

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,950
that was was Panda

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,409
yes Panda sought to improve the quality

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,000
of Google search results by removing or

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,919
reducing the ranking of duplicated

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,409
duplicate content than pages and low

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,210
quality domains so panda was all about

00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,710
trying to get rid of lots and lots of

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:39,919
stuff that's not necessarily of value

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:41,570
and focusing on the quality and then you

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,210
ask you a question about spelling words

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,140
correctly and things like that

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,960
hummingbird was all about trying to get

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:51,560
the context so let me think of a word

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,240
that could be used in two ways space so

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,929
you've got space stars in the sky

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,550
you've got like space as in like on the

00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,070
ground like you can have like a work

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,470
space it's the same word but it's got a

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,850
completely different context so Google

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,350
actually started saying well we need to

00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,540
understand the context because so many

00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,690
types in space we need to give them the

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,120
right space make sense so they had I'll

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,310
grow them around that and then pigeons

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,080
all about local stuff okay cool

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,580
so for the practical section I don't

00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,500
know how many of you had a chance to

00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,210
prepare for this to look at it but

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,549
there's a couple of different things

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,609
options that we can look at

00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:30,529
but one is Google my business if you

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,380
don't have a Google my business profile

00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:37,190
I highly recommend that you do type in

00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,539
focus rooms sunning hill or Branson or

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,039
something like it and you will see that

00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,930
one of the results that comes up and

00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,029
takes most of the page on your mobile

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,609
phone is a Google my business profile

00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:48,589
it's free so you want it doesn't cost

00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:50,299
you anything it has all sorts of good

00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,190
information on it's like if you've got a

00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:55,039
store what time it opens or closes

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,510
directions to it reviews there's a whole

00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,180
range of different things you can do on

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,190
it if you don't have one today is a good

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,619
day for you to do it

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:05,450
keyword research so which words should

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,960
you use and which words shouldn't you

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:11,450
use we can have a go at that how you can

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,549
review your website's SEO from top to

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,349
bottom so how are you tracking on your

00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:16,430
on-page stuff we've got some tools for

00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:19,160
that one

00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,539
WordPress plugins what can you do on

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,220
your WordPress site that's quick and

00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,950
easy just to make sure that your SEO is

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:29,299
all in order how to submit your sitemap

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:31,430
to Google review your SEO performance on

00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:32,960
search console so the questions about

00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,819
how do I see the links that we have back

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,789
to us I can show you how to do that and

00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:39,920
then ideas for generating backlinks

00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:44,690
because it's always a tricky one how do

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:47,569
you get your website so that was the

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,759
list I'll run through it now cool so

00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:52,029
option number one setting up a Google my

00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:54,410
business profile if you don't have one

00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:57,349
you really want to get one of these it

00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,589
also works on Google Maps so that's

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:03,200
other nice thing so you can get found on

00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:05,150
search results and then also this finds

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,000
its way into all sorts of things so I

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,339
don't know if you guys made an event in

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,869
your calendar if you typed if you've got

00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:14,960
Gmail or something like apt and you type

00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,849
in focus group as location this profile

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,099
would have popped up you didn't have to

00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,140
type in the actual address so it has a

00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:23,000
whole range of applications

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,250
keyword research so there's a whole

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,289
bunch of different options some of the

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,490
guys are we ranked I quite like we rank

00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,390
because they're really simple and not

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,670
that expensive

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,750
there's Moz hugely comprehensive

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,690
probably the market leader

00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,490
there's Amazon's version called a href

00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,360
and then there's another crowd that I

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,770
found it's not cheap

00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,050
with free option called k:w finder if

00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,900
you try to look around what keywords to

00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,660
use and here's an example of why you

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,900
want to do this research so this is the

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,400
Google Ads platform its use so if you

00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,440
don't have access to it you don't have

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,840
to run ads you can just go on on to

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,370
Google ads and open up account and if

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,470
you click on tools up the top there the

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,990
gal come help you with us you can go

00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:09,020
find the keyword planner so I went and

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:12,080
had a look in Sandton so just in Sandton

00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,880
and English over the last year how many

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,140
people searched for the word word online

00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:20,450
store and there was 70 people a month

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,320
and online shopping was a thousand so

00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:25,670
we'll take 70 that's kind of the average

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,310
number of times and sent in someone's

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,870
search for online store the question

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,520
about how do you work out the

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,990
click-through rates this is probably

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,910
about as close as I can get to giving

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:39,470
you an answer in terms of like how many

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:43,040
people search for things so online still

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:49,550
we got 70 did the same search for

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:51,710
e-commerce and I got 110 140 so there

00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:55,550
were twice as many roughly if you take

00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:58,280
140 versus the 70 so if you're going to

00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,780
write a page about shopping online you

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,820
can either talk about having an online

00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,550
store or you can talk about an

00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,440
e-commerce store and you can use the one

00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,890
as your thing if you had to choose

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:13,190
between two and you were focusing on the

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:15,170
senton area over the last year I would

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,480
say based on this write it about

00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,430
e-commerce because they're twice as many

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,800
people looking for it as there are

00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,950
people looking for a LAN store and you

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,070
can do this for anything we once had a

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:30,650
company the whole big spin was on inside

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:33,050
everything inside inside inside we went

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,330
and did some research in terms of what

00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,430
keywords worked and we found that there

00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,190
about 300 people a month research for

00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:42,080
marketing insight we went and looked for

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,520
marketing research and they were three

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,710
thousand three hundred people who

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,570
searched from marketing research so our

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,970
suggestion to them was we know you're

00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,410
big on insight but maybe try to use a

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,160
marketing research you're going to reach

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,099
10 times

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,289
number of people small change that you

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,700
can have a big result and the other cool

00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:00,799
thing about this it tells you what your

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,010
competitions like so there's not too

00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:08,240
much competition around me ecommerce

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:09,980
medium wears online store it's high so

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,839
actually maybe you want to try to

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,829
ecommerce they're more people and it's

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,510
easier to get to the top coop so that's

00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:21,950
keyword research we can do some play

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:23,690
around that a good SEO tool so there's

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:27,950
lots of little bits and pieces and to

00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:29,750
get it right is quite hard so be lazy or

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:35,059
as some of my colleagues say be smart

00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:37,430
lazy and if you want a free tool to use

00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:39,200
we hooked one up on our website it runs

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,299
off an account that we have that's the

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,170
domain click lead come forward slash

00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:50,240
free - SEO - report and you can get a

00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:52,400
free SEO report it'll look like this and

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,589
basically what this thing does is it

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,020
goes through your whole website it gives

00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:58,910
you a score so how you doing and then

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,029
for every single factor that you need to

00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,710
worry about it gives you like you need

00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:05,779
to improve this will fix this or tweak

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,819
this and you can also do it for pages

00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:09,710
within your website so you don't have to

00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:12,260
go and try and read the metadata on the

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,000
page and try and unpack every alt tag

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,440
and go through all that kind of stuff

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,619
you can literally this is we rank in

00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,180
case you're wondering you can literally

00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:24,680
just pop it in here and it will give you

00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,839
a checklist this is maybe you should fix

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,069
this so change this or do this and then

00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,720
they often come up with like little

00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,430
helpful hints so if you don't know what

00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,440
the words mean they actually have a

00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,210
little thing that says title tag and it

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,770
explains the title tag is this so it

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,059
should be this mini characters long and

00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:43,910
this is the purpose of it so if you

00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:47,779
completely unprepared pick a website and

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:51,049
go through this it will help you then we

00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:54,140
can talk about plugins this is all in

00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:57,140
one SEO and just SEO - plugins on

00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:01,270
WordPress both very very good Siegen

00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:04,039
says that we must use that one so we do

00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,690
see Egan is Siegen Davis he's like a

00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,940
word press here

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,890
cool so yo just SEO looks a little bit

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,019
like this so coming back to the page I

00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,700
showed you it literally breaks it down

00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,499
and it helps you to put in all the

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,690
things and then it gives you nice little

00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:21,059
indicators so this is good this is bad

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,710
and again the whole idea behind it is to

00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,989
make your life easy so you don't have to

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,549
understand all the technical things you

00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:29,729
literally just pop it in and it says oh

00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:33,539
this is too long this is too short you

00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:36,180
know do you have enough words in it

00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:37,739
we're talking about keyword stuffing it

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,960
will actually tell you maybe a little

00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:42,479
bit less keywords more keywords you know

00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,059
that sort of stuff all very very easy to

00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:47,009
use if you have a WordPress website

00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:50,599
submit your site to Google Google has

00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:53,279
what they call search console

00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:56,640
very interesting if you want to know how

00:42:53,279 --> 00:43:00,319
Google has indexed your website go to

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,920
the Google search bar and put in site

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,150
colon and then your website address so

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,519
site colon and then whatever your

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,469
website addresses and Google will show

00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,329
you search results of all the page that

00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:14,460
pages on your website that they are the

00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,989
next so if you're wondering why

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,910
something's not coming up or you don't

00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:19,799
know you're unsure you can literally go

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,690
and see everything in Google search just

00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:26,430
by adding that a little site colon

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:29,460
thingy right search console looks like

00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:32,130
this so if you're using WordPress and

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,529
just is here your site map was actually

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,450
got a different name but literally you

00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:39,930
just say this is our website the swell

00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,989
side map is and you Google say hey we we

00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:46,109
checked it we found all these pages

00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:49,019
happy please please please do this if

00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:50,849
you redo your website go do this again

00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,700
if you add a whole bunch of content to

00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:55,950
your website go do this again don't wait

00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,569
for Google to come find you when you can

00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:00,359
just go tell them hey something bigs

00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:02,579
happened and depending on how often you

00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,440
update your website Google either come

00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,779
back daily weekly monthly or whatever it

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,930
might be but it's really easy to do

00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:12,210
what's worth bothering cool and then you

00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,400
can also track things so your backlinks

00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,609
you can see how your performances so you

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,350
can see you can like choose dates and

00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,360
countries and times

00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:24,810
this country filter is often really

00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,370
important you can have all sorts of

00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,230
people coming from all over the place

00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:30,090
but if your customers are all in South

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:33,570
Africa you only really want to know

00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:35,220
about South Africa and then you can see

00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,690
how many people clicked on stuff how

00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,980
many times did you come up and research

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,530
results

00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,420
what was your average position so that's

00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,510
not very good you know an average page

00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:48,390
study that's mean page 3 so no one's

00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,200
there but you can track it over time and

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,880
see how things are going

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,130
and just helps you keep an eye on these

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,360
things I can do search console it's

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,090
quite nice and easy to do

00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,360
and then things like this you can

00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:03,480
actually go and say on this page how

00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,550
many people are pointing into pointing

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,200
into it I told you about those guys who

00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,260
copied our website and then just had a

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,060
link to us because these chops so I

00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:16,890
remember I shouldn't say that you raise

00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:18,480
the tape but again you can see who's

00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,990
pointing in to us what's happening

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,760
where's this little traffic coming from

00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:25,380
cool and then lastly we can brainstorm

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,050
some ideas if you wants about building

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,480
backlinks so I generally have good

00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,850
content have content that people want to

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,860
share the people uninterested no one's

00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,080
going to share it make it interesting

00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,660
all right some things that are really

00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,250
helpful so like this community it's like

00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,560
got lots of South African businesses

00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:47,580
it's just a nice easy way of you getting

00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,440
your website onto another page so

00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,360
business listings can help press

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,960
releases like I mentioned these are

00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:57,090
great if you can get free free press

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,230
releases that'll be amazing sometimes

00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,450
you have to pay for them it really

00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,330
depends and then partner with other

00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,530
companies and influencers again with

00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,060
this type of thing it's really you want

00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,100
to be thinking out the box what can we

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,740
do how can we get someone to talk about

00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,120
us and there's a whole range of

00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,680
different ways that you can go about

00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:17,040
doing that

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,710
so those are my practical options do you

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,300
want to pick one I can go through one at

00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,790
the front or you guys can do stuff where

00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,880
you at and I can come help you okay cool

00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:29,280
so this is an example of an SEO report

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,990
lots of companies can do this this is

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,660
just one way of doing it you don't have

00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:36,030
to do it like this it's more about

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,260
just saving yourself the time and the

00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,810
effort of having to work all these

00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,150
things out yourself so if I take our

00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:46,790
company's website and we got a score of

00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,790
71 which and this is not too bad but

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,930
yeah alright so title tag that's the

00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,310
title tag so we got that right and it

00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,990
gives us a tick and they made a

00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,990
description it explains what that looks

00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:03,150
like it then goes and says this is what

00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,100
it could look like in Google so you can

00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,450
very easily see the important things you

00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,800
don't have to go and try work all of

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,830
this out or search for it or any other

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:14,190
kind of stuff headings okay we've been

00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,570
naughty we've got two h1 headings so

00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,100
Google doesn't like that because what's

00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,390
this page about is it about the one

00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,070
heading or the other heading so we

00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:27,930
should have one hopefully someone will

00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:30,990
fix that keyword cloud so here you can

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,600
see this is all the words that are

00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,220
referenced on this page and this

00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,600
sometimes is very very interesting so

00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,180
you're now saying people don't use the

00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:43,110
name of their company on that page if

00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:44,610
that's not coming up in this then you

00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,260
need to go and put your name or your

00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,050
company because Google's checking that

00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,910
yeah so this keyword cloud you can

00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:55,410
quickly see tell you what the page is

00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:57,330
about Alt alt tags so have we gone and

00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,960
put alt tags on every single image yes

00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:03,450
we did on all 82 so that's nice one

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,180
in page links so are we linking to other

00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:09,210
people broken links there no broken

00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,370
links do we have that WW resolved that I

00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:14,280
was talking to you about yes we fix that

00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,900
okay we do have a robots.txt file then

00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,020
listen to this thing we do you have a

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,060
sitemap don't listen to this thing

00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,100
underscores in URLs there's an

00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,800
interesting one if you use an underscore

00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:29,520
it joins the two words together to make

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,510
one long weird word whereas if you use a

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,880
- it's two separate words so if

00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:40,100
someone's searching for something say

00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:43,590
it's like dog collar if you use dog

00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,540
underscore parlor for someone to find

00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,010
their page they would have to type into

00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,080
Google dog and

00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:52,440
school Paulo because Google sees it as

00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,030
one word if you use the - you could

00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,270
write dog Paulo because it's easier to

00:48:54,030 --> 00:49:00,780
words small thing but can have a

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:02,190
difference in higher URLs work and then

00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,340
literally this thing goes through

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:08,630
everything is it mobile-friendly the

00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:12,270
house fast as it are using technology

00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:16,980
these are all things that have an impact

00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:20,970
on your SEO so Google have a mobile page

00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:25,500
speed test which is all about testing

00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:27,810
how fast your page speeds is if you have

00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,720
an online platform there's a direct

00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:34,110
correlation between how much money you

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,880
make and how fast your website is I

00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,680
can't remember the stats will top my

00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,870
head but literally for every split

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,960
second on average that an Amazon page

00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:44,550
loads faster they make like an extra

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,010
hundred thousand dollars or something I

00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:49,590
get like it's crazy because literally

00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,630
people if they don't if it takes too

00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,310
long they're not interested and the same

00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,560
goes for just browsing websites and

00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,300
searching for things so that's right now

00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:06,650
you can see what we're frustrated while

00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:06,650
we wait okay let me just swap out yes

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:14,940
yes actually most of our people who come

00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:15,990
to our website are on desktops I think

00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:25,890
that's because they're looking for a

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:28,110
little work yeah well I think I would

00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,550
just suggest using the Google one the

00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,700
only problem with the Google one that we

00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:34,080
found now I'm having issues with the

00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,790
internet I was not going to have this

00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,790
problem anyway

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:52,430
you were gonna breakdance not me I'll

00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:54,410
just hit my back so oh there we go yeah

00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,410
okay cool anyway we're gonna swap over

00:50:54,410 --> 00:51:00,859
to fosston pit okay cool I think it's

00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:02,090
this one test your mobile site speed so

00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:03,500
what's nice about this is it actually

00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,420
gives you no idea of how fast your

00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:10,670
website is because puts it against the

00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:12,980
benchmark internationally and it tells

00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,270
you how you can improve it the one thing

00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,440
that we found with these tests it

00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,560
doesn't always work well if you're using

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,850
a caching server so if you've got cloud

00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:24,320
flay or something like that on your

00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:25,430
website and you it's caching your site

00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,250
if you don't know what I'm talking about

00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:32,119
go talk to the guys in that room and it

00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:35,630
doesn't always pick it up so your

00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,730
website slows shows are slowing slower

00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,850
than it actually does another thing that

00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,859
can affect these scores is if your page

00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,200
loads asynchronously so what that means

00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:47,810
is it doesn't go in and order things

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,130
happen at the same time because then

00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,810
what can happen is your website could

00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,790
actually load at the beginning for

00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:55,640
people see and all the other stuff

00:51:52,790 --> 00:52:00,859
happens in the background but to give me

00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:03,980
an example cool so this is not so bad if

00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:08,119
we're to go through this thing okay cool

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:11,000
so your title tag is probably a little

00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:13,940
bit too long and the reason why that's

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,830
probably not a good thing is that when

00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:19,609
you're on Google search it will cut it

00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:22,400
off at a certain point so you could be a

00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:24,260
professional fan art port is what could

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,330
show up or something like that like you

00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,160
can do funny things so if you get your

00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,670
character limit I think it's 60 to 70

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,100
characters so it's probably doing that

00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:36,530
then it'll show up nicely in Google

00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,320
search you don't have a Meta Description

00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:41,810
so this is basically what gets pulled

00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,150
through into the Google will pull the

00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:45,560
next available piece of text on the page

00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,530
when they when you come up in search

00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,910
results so that could be anything and if

00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,530
it's a photography site you probably

00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,059
don't have very much text which means it

00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,650
could be a combination of things

00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:57,589
and I could end up looking a little bit

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,880
black gobbledygook II so I would suggest

00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:00,589
you want to write a little story about

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,259
what if people are going to look for you

00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:05,599
what is the one thing that's gonna be of

00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:07,489
interest to them and I remember the key

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,199
thing about all of this is relevance if

00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,849
you're looking for a tog refer what's

00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,400
important to you what are you looking

00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:14,539
for that's what you want to see because

00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,549
you're gonna see a whole bunch of other

00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,869
photographers and you say well why why

00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:22,609
am i choosing this one out of the search

00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:26,599
results so your headings aren't don't

00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:27,890
have your company name in it so if

00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:30,349
Google was to look at the headings on

00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:34,569
this page it's a it's about us but it's

00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:38,900
actually about your photography company

00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:41,689
key word cloud cool

00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,059
so the most third thing is your name of

00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:45,650
your company that's great you tell

00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:50,539
people a lot about income streams in

00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:52,400
August free I don't know if that's what

00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:55,819
you want to be advertising but you tell

00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,499
people a lot about free creative

00:53:55,819 --> 00:54:01,789
director that's good code words

00:53:57,499 --> 00:54:05,029
that's quite cryptic but you get the

00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:07,009
idea of what this page is about it's

00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:09,499
it's more about a photography company

00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:12,679
and less about other sorts of things

00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:14,539
like copying strategies or coping

00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:21,169
strategies I don't know what you up to

00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:24,799
there creative exploration well as long

00:54:21,169 --> 00:54:28,369
as that's free so I'm just teasing you

00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:30,559
cuz I can but you get the idea it

00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:32,179
doesn't take long to work out maybe the

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,049
text on this page needs to be tweaked a

00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:37,849
little bit to be more about the business

00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:40,969
alt tags well then you've got to

00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:42,739
redirect great stuff the site map on

00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:45,739
this thing is not always working so you

00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:48,499
may or may not have one and we can go

00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:50,479
through blocking factors that's fine

00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:53,390
domain you got a blog cool it's

00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:56,349
moyerfamily excellent I can't stress the

00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:59,059
importance of mobile friendliness enough

00:54:56,349 --> 00:55:00,499
people everyone has a phone

00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:02,449
everyone here searches on their phone

00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:04,549
but I'm probably certain that not

00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:06,779
everyone's website works nicely on a

00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:08,219
phone if your phone

00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:10,949
if your website doesn't work on a phone

00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,179
people will not use your brand they'll

00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:14,339
go there and say these people are

00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:16,739
unprofessional they're hard to use I

00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:18,179
don't like them so please if you don't

00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:23,099
have a mobile responsive website please

00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:27,150
fix that so well-done does okay so this

00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:28,380
asset minimum of minification so this

00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,919
has got to do with things like your

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:34,199
pictures are quite large funny story we

00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:36,419
once had a client in Singapore or

00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,949
Malaysia and they thought of it they

00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:40,199
were they were the experts and they went

00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:42,269
and loaded a five megabyte picture onto

00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:43,859
the home page of their website and they

00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:45,959
got a couple of thousand visitors a day

00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:48,269
and within a couple of hours that crash

00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:50,009
their website server because they had

00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:52,499
used all their bandwidth and then they

00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:54,809
want to know why their website broke so

00:55:52,499 --> 00:55:57,359
you do want to pay attention to this

00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:59,519
especially on mobile data if you're

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,859
trying to reach people who are very

00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,509
conscious about their data use so data

00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,269
in South Africa is expensive not

00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:07,499
everyone has access to Wi-Fi so then you

00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,789
need to pay attention to that because

00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:12,359
you don't want people to have to pay too

00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:14,749
much to see you website there's a nice

00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:18,209
little program called I think it's tiny

00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:21,119
PNG it's got a little cute panda on the

00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:23,519
page if you like pandas but tiny PNG

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,109
calm I think will help you to reduce

00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:28,529
your file sizes if you've got very big

00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:30,269
images they also do JPEGs so Liz you

00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:31,619
could go and pop some of your images

00:56:30,269 --> 00:56:34,439
through there and that will help you

00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,299
teach page loads faster cool acid

00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:38,429
compression so again there's a couple of

00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:40,640
different things that you could do you

00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:43,019
might want to start caching your website

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,349
so for those who don't know what caching

00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:48,359
is basically what you do is if your I'll

00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:51,209
use an extreme example your website's

00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:53,339
hosted in America what you do is you

00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:55,859
have like a mini temporary version of

00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:57,599
your website in Johannesburg so when

00:56:55,859 --> 00:57:00,059
people look at your website then look at

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,880
the Johannesburg version so it's quicker

00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:04,019
and closer because it's closer and then

00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,839
every now and again the Johannesburg

00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:08,640
version updates to the main one so it

00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:10,979
helps your website to load faster by

00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,079
making it closer there's a few other

00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:15,109
things involved the guys in the

00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:18,480
development room can explain them to you

00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:20,849
cool languages top of each

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,500
cool so yeah there's a couple of

00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:24,810
different things the one thing you would

00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,030
know chair is so backlinks so you don't

00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:29,670
have very many backlinks you got 24

00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:32,670
websites that point into you and you

00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,500
don't have a very high school so you can

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,700
sort out the on-page SEO do some things

00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,680
there because that's within your control

00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,079
but if you could like a couple of good

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,660
links in so maybe if there's like a

00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,040
local magazine or local newspaper and

00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,930
you go do a photo shoot for them and

00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,220
they write an article about you that's a

00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,770
great way you can get a good quality

00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:53,640
link that one link can maybe help you

00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:56,849
jump to score up and then other things

00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:59,390
you can do so they can't find your

00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:03,000
Facebook page so I'm sure you've got one

00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:05,099
so that one tag that I had about forcing

00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,109
your social recognition you add that to

00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:08,940
your website and now Google will say oh

00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:11,160
that's your Facebook page and then they

00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,470
can index that as well

00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,000
sometimes LinkedIn profiles Facebook

00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,099
pages and things like I've come up quite

00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,369
high in switch results because those are

00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:25,040
white quite well-known websites I hope

00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:25,040
