Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	The talk will focus on using WordPress to test and validate ideas in an affordable manner. It will be based on my experiences of running several websites, including ZApreneur, Think Workers and WriteInvisible. I will draw lessons and outline a process and will offer a checklist. I think it kinda works.
