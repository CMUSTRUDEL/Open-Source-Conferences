Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Johannesburg 2018
Description: 
	Soon after the release of WordPress 15 years ago, support for internationalization was added to the software. This meant that themes, plugins, and WordPress itself could be translated. This was a huge deal as WordPress is used all over the world, in countries where English is not the main language. WordPress was quickly translated into German, Japanese and many more languages.
Over the years, WordPress has steadily improved the way we have to work with internationalization. However, challenges still exist and there will always be new ones ahead. Projects like Gutenberg and ecosystems beyond WordPress.org force us to continuously iterate.
In this talk youâ€™ll learn how to make use of the latest and greatest technology to make your WordPress plugin or theme fully internationalized. Pascal is going to highlight how you can leverage the powers of WordPress, GlotPress, and WP-CLI to improve the translation workflow in your WordPress projects.
