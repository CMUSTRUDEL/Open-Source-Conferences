okay I'm going to start my presentation

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:10,440
by the end of this presentation we

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,170
should all have our little online store

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,639
set up so I want to ask did everyone

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,650
have the requirements the requirements

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,920
is for you to have your WordPress

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,080
installed and to have a theme that's for

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,130
WordPress and to also have the

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,170
WooCommerce plug-in downloaded so if you

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,960
don't have that that's what we're going

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,550
to do now just by a show of hands who

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,140
has all these three components

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,690
okay everyone else we just have a little

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,890
time you have to make sure that you have

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,730
a team that supports WooCommerce how do

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:52,039
I normally get it is that I go to my

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,180
themes on my dashboard and I search for

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,010
WooCommerce and it's gonna give me a

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,079
number of themes that are adapted for

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,809
WooCommerce otherwise you can just

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,689
download storefront

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:09,780
that's the advised theme for WordPress

00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:13,830
we all have our theme installed and we

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,020
all have our dashboard open now we need

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,159
to download the WooCommerce plug-in so

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,040
if you know that you have the

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,670
WooCommerce plug-in that's cool you can

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,400
just start running the setup wizard so

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,549
before we continue by the end of my part

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,409
of the presentation we should be able to

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:36,840
install and configure WooCommerce and be

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,909
able to add a product and view it so at

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,009
this point we're installing WooCommerce

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,479
as a plugin and running the setup wizard

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,790
when you go to your plugins you go to

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,180
add new and then you can search for

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,810
WooCommerce when you find it you can

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,659
then say install now so once we have

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,840
WooCommerce installed we're gonna run

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,270
the setup wizard if you already had

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,060
Walker Murs installed before then you

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,899
can go to your settings advanced and

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,170
then you check on help you'll be able to

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,959
run the setup wizard again so we've

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,670
installed

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,680
Commerce first step is gonna ask us for

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,700
location detail so we enter our country

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,719
and we enter our address and then we

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,540
choose currency where it's written

00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:36,609
dollar they are we gonna choose the rent

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,889
and then we're going to say I will also

00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,900
be selling products or services in

00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,790
person so we have to tick that box I

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,430
will also be selling products and/or

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,980
services in person this is what's going

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,909
to enable us to have the pay fast option

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,250
in our next page so on this page make

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,439
sure that you click on I will also be

00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,760
selling products or services in person

00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,769
okay so our next screen is where we

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,169
select our options our payment options

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,359
in our case since we're going to be

00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:10,329
implementing the pay fast later we're

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:13,439
going to select to tick the box for pay

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:17,319
fast we're gonna use pay fast as our

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,379
payment method personally I haven't

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,090
selected any offline payment but if you

00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:25,659
feel like you want to use offline

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,879
payments such as Bank bank transfers and

00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:31,959
all that you can select that when you

00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:37,479
set up but for me I'm just selecting pay

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:39,189
fast and then I press on continue so

00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:43,090
here with the offline payments I

00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:45,189
selected nothing because I don't want to

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,720
enable check payments or bank transfers

00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:48,810
or cash on delivery I don't want to

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:54,549
enable that

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:57,790
so my next screen is about shipping so I

00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,849
have to decide how all my items wait and

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,579
hour they measured so for the weights I

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,889
say kilogram for the dimensions I'm

00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:11,290
going to measure them in centimeters and

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:14,979
not inches and then we get to a page of

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:19,329
recommended apps that they want us to

00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:21,310
install we select none of them like

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:27,539
they're showing MailChimp you deselect

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:29,979
MailChimp we do select any recommended

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:32,560
application and then you get to the

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,779
activation page where we have to select

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,460
if we want to continue with jetpack then

00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:40,840
you go to the bottom of your screen and

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,669
you click skip this step you can yeah we

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,669
can enter the email for the newsletter

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,500
or you can leave it blank at this point

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,770
we're actually going to start creating

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,770
our product so once we've gotten to this

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,580
point I'll just leave my email blank and

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,440
I click on this button create a product

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,650
now that we started creating our product

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,590
we get to the product page we can give

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,590
it a name and give it a long description

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:16,080
and then we have to add some data that

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:16,080
have to do with the the product itself

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,979
we can on the general tab there we can

00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:26,469
enter the price the regular price is

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,719
your regular item price and then the

00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:31,180
sale price is the price that is going to

00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:35,349
be there whenever your item is on sale

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,250
and next to this you can see a link that

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:41,529
says schedule where you can decide when

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:46,419
the sale starts and when it's going to

00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:48,940
end so here I have an option to enable

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,610
stock management at product level if I

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,320
don't click that then the website is not

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,740
going to keep track of my stock online

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,860
so are we going to check that so that we

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,729
are able to change our stock levels when

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,289
someone buys online and everything so we

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,560
click we select

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,690
stock management we enable it and then

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,219
we can put a stock quantity of our

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:17,800
choice they are put 20 then we can

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,650
decide if we allow back orders if we

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,389
allow back orders then our stock can go

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,599
to values that are less than zero

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:31,810
because people will be allowed to make

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:32,980
orders even when I don't have stock and

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,500
that's this

00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:42,610
other this is other parameter here sold

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,620
individually if I enable that during one

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,280
purchase someone won't be able to order

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,920
more than one of this item so the moment

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,770
I enable this and someone comes out to

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,520
buy stuff on my store they will only be

00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:01,960
able to add one of this product not two

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:06,850
not three only one my case here I don't

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:11,770
want that so I didn't select this

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:18,070
individual sale the SKU what does it

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:20,710
mean the business people stock top

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,020
keeping unit yes it's the unique number

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,550
that you give to your item so it has to

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:30,430
be it a unique no two product can share

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,500
it and it has to you have to make sure

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,840
that it doesn't match a post ID either

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,050
because when a product is displayed on

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,960
WordPress it's going to use the idea of

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,910
your item so if it's matches the post ID

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,680
then there's going to be a conflict so

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:50,470
your SKU has to be a unique number of a

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,260
numeric value that you are saying to

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:58,990
your product here and it must not match

00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:00,850
any idea of a post so next a lot of

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,380
other things that you can add there but

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,060
because we don't have much time and I

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,320
want you to actually do it on your own

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:12,870
for a second product I will skip to the

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:16,450
adding an image on the right panel of

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,200
your post there's a place called product

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:23,230
image if you go to product image you can

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,680
then upload a product yes you can set a

00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:29,680
product image once you've chosen your

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,669
product image you can also decide to put

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,330
more images for that one product and you

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,979
do that with its written product gallery

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,000
if you have model if you want to have

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,000
more than one image

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,980
so in your product gallery you can go

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,220
there and add another number of images

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,050
that are linked to your product

00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:01,450
now you can publish your product and

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,250
then we're going to view it when you go

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,560
to your WordPress site you can just

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:09,340
click on the shop link and we're going

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,020
to have our product showing there so if

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,740
everything is fine we should have our

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,750
products showing there in our shop what

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,540
you can do now is to try and create

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:23,230
another item and we're going to link

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:28,660
them together we're going to use that

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:36,340
linked articles tab you can create a

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:39,670
second product enter the details of your

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:43,510
product the general details a name a

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,700
description a price a sale price if you

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,180
want to okay you do your inventory as

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,250
well and then we're going there's a tab

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,510
called linked products you have to

00:09:51,250 --> 00:10:00,310
decide if this product can be linked to

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:02,320
something else so there's two boxes

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,200
there there's upsells and then there's

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,390
cross-sells upsells is what you're going

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,190
to recommend to your buyers to say that

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,950
you looked at this but you could

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,500
actually go for this one so if I put any

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,110
product inside the upsells it's going to

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,690
recommend and to look at that product

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,350
because it might be better and then the

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,750
cross-sells

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,500
is what I recommend you might also like

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,150
this so I can add products there to tell

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,300
them that they might also like this so

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:34,980
we're going to try and cross-sell with

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,980
