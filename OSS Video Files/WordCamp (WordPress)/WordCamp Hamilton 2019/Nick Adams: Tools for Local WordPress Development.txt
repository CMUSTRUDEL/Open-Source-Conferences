alright thanks June

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,340
all right yeah so like Jun said I am

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,140
McAdams

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,470
I live in Rochester New York I'm

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,630
originally from Connecticut and for a

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:32,430
while I was in London Ontario I know a

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:37,380
couple hundred people here and so I am

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,180
the CEO o @wp buffs and so what we do is

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,050
WordPress maintenance to support we're a

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,399
24/7 team we've got people on five

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,370
different continents all around the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,620
world so we're literally 24/7 we cover

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,190
every single time zone and that's our

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,109
website wpbf.com

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,329
also most importantly I like to really

00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,460
have a rollercoaster so I really want to

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,969
like start this thing off by really just

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,860
losing every single person here and then

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,170
winning everyone back by admitting that

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,670
being a Bruins fan because I'm from New

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:16,680
England does mean that I am like a

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,860
Bruins fan because the Wailers left but

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,490
I'm also a Raptors fan so I think I just

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,980
want everyone back and about to win the

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,750
Stanley Cup and about to win the NBA

00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,580
championship so totally true pretty

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:40,650
sweet that both teams that I love are in

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:42,990
the finals so that is it about me so

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,750
today I'm talking about local WordPress

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,450
development and so there are a lot of

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,500
great reasons to do that

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,420
the most obvious one that I find is you

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,960
don't need internet access I'm someone

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,070
who I'm all over the place I like to go

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,080
to the beach I like to like travel a lot

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,370
and so one of the things with that is

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,039
like you don't always have internet

00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,959
access even like with like having your

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,760
own personal hotspot on your phone those

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,129
are so unreliable sometimes that like

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,930
you know you're fine and then also you

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,870
lose it so I love being able to work

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,850
anywhere and just like develop sites

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,550
without needing

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:27,110
access you have control over the server

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,600
that's one of the things that I

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,390
absolutely love as well especially

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,670
because there are several great hosting

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,920
companies out there but no hosting

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,760
company ever promises you a 100% uptime

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,910
and that's on purpose that's because

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,590
nobody can promise that with an online

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,130
server there's just too many factors and

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,900
so I'm guessing probably this has

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,210
happened to several people where you're

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,180
working on a website and you're like you

00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,380
you're on the deadline and all of a

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,110
sudden there's just like an issue like

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,760
PHP stops working and so it's just like

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,450
it's giving you errors it says like the

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,100
PHP module isn't running whereas like

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,740
when you're working locally you don't

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,450
have to rely on that other host to make

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,720
sure that your site is running to each

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:19,180
other's running properly you have full

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:23,300
control over the server and then

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,560
security if your website that while

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,990
you're working on it is only accessible

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,060
on your computer there's pretty much no

00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,710
chance that anyone can hack in unless

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,880
you know they're sitting right next to

00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,270
you and hopefully you noticed them

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,530
touching your keyboard if you see

00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:41,900
someone doing that it's usually a

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:44,510
security threat for so many reasons yeah

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,500
yeah cats cats are the ones who can

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,870
break this rule but yeah so security for

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,280
real when you're developing the site you

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,860
may especially if you're writing

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,310
plug-ins or something you really don't

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,630
want that to be accessible to to the

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,980
world until you're done with it because

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,660
you want to be able to test it for

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,570
security you don't want to have like

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,360
security flaws sitting on this live site

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,050
while you're developing it and that

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,210
happens a lot

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,050
there are bots that can actually like

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,400
scan when as soon as a website is

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,890
launched like they can find it and they

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,660
will immediately try hacking it

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,520
especially because at the beginning of a

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,530
new website is a lot of times when

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,110
they're most vulnerable especially if

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,000
you install WordPress but don't set it

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,320
up they can actually just set up their

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,500
own site on your server

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,690
so working locally is just awesome for

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,320
security you have direct access to the

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,760
files this is fantastic for development

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,130
especially if you're editing a lot of

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,720
files you can just like open up several

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:52,110
files in in whatever IDE or code editor

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,540
you're using and you can just edit them

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,770
and save them and rename them as much as

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,600
you want without having to worry about

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,170
sending back and forth between the

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,850
server that especially again falls back

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,320
on to you you want something you can

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,570
rely on and that you have control over

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
and if you're relying on your

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,930
development sending files back and forth

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,640
to the server the second that there's

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,100
even like a mild interruption of the

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,040
server all of a sudden you can't push to

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:23,570
life and so you just end up with delays

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,570
I think the remote just dad

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,040
there's also server caching anyone who

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,660
has ever worked on the live server

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,670
especially depending on which one you're

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,860
on site ground is one that's known for

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,960
this they have fantastic server caching

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,150
the problem is if you're trying to edit

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
a site on that you have to like clear

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,230
like for caches before you're sure that

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,920
you've cleared all of it and so you can

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,170
like make a change and then refresh and

00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,530
then the change hasn't happened so then

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,120
you clear like one of the caches and the

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,590
change doesn't happen then you go and

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,350
you clear a different cache and then

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,230
finally you see your change whereas when

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,850
you're look working locally unless you

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,350
put caching on there there's not gonna

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,330
be server caching you don't really need

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,300
it when you're working locally anyway

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,460
and so that's just fantastic because

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,890
every time you change it you can change

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,470
one line in a file click Save and

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:20,670
immediately refresh your page and your

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:24,030
updates are on there so that's just the

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,700
reasons for why to work locally I highly

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,230
encourage you for everyone and so in

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,940
this talk I'm also going to be showing

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,410
just how easy it is to work locally so

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,450
if you've always heard about people

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,700
saying like oh I build websites locally

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,930
but on my own local server that sounds

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,840
like something that may be very

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:43,020
complicated but it's actually really

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,800
easy like it's no different than using

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,800
like Microsoft or

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,830
so just a couple of best practices

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,250
things I like to point out one of the

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,289
big ones is naming file versions this

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,470
one's really important just because if

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:03,070
you're consistently editing files and

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,080
then you need to go back you know this

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,280
is the same for online but it's easier

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,440
to do when you're working locally

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,320
because you can so rapidly just like

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,000
edit save edit save edit save then you

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,370
find out that you accidentally over

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,650
wrote something or made a change you

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,389
didn't mean to change so one of the

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,250
things I always recommend is whenever

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,800
you're doing it it gets a little crazy

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,900
if you're making a lot of changes but

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,520
anytime you're making real changes

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,680
beyond just like changing the color

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,180
you're there especially if you're

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,370
working on like functions if you're

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,050
changing function names or anything like

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,160
that or using different using new

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,440
filters

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,599
I always rename the file and so like I

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,910
have my style dot CSS which is like my

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,190
actual active one but like if you go

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,520
into a site that I've worked on you'll

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,010
see like style like only on my local

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,370
server I don't push this to live but

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:02,620
I've got like style version to style

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:05,199
version 236 and I do that and so I

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,699
actually show that to like use as many

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,539
as you need to you know if you need to

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,830
get all the way up to up to version 10

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,050
if you need yet all the way up to 100

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,880
origin 100 when you're working locally

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm these files are tiny they aren't

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,039
gonna slow down your site because you've

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,919
got you know like a whole bunch of like

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,870
50 kilobyte files it's gonna take a lot

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,699
of files for that to actually add up

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,889
like thousands and thousands of them so

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,659
don't be afraid to just keep renaming

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,310
files so that you have backups of

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,610
everything you do yeah you have a

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,610
question

00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:14,209
yep yeah yeah for sure

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,190
yeah you can change the the file types

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,630
that it doesn't you don't show up

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,850
because if you are editing like PHP

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,899
files that is one of things if you

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,240
aren't aware any PHP files in you know

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,500
in a plugin are are active as long as

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,480
the plugins active so you don't want to

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,149
have excess files but yeah so whatever

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,100
naming convention works best for you the

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,500
most important thing here is just make

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,910
sure you have one that's written out and

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,040
make sure that it's one that you can

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,820
understand so that way you can remember

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,130
you know that you have this version and

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,110
it worked on this version and then you

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,940
remember like oh I you know now I'm on

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,399
version 13 and it doesn't work so I need

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,339
to go back to version 10 and look to see

00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,630
what my changes are so yeah whatever

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,050
naming convention works best for you is

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:07,779
definitely a good way to go

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:09,230
yeah so git is definitely another option

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,720
I

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,300
I do love using it especially when I'm

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,920
working on like more like on an actual

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,620
development server so I don't if I'm

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,449
using git I don't actually use like this

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,230
naming convention if I'm using git then

00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm just you know I'm using branches and

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,029
this is more so like if I'm just like

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,899
editing a file real quick which is more

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:37,070
so I don't use git usually when I'm like

00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,870
when I'm developing the whole thing

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,430
locally that's I more so use get when

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,190
like I'm editing a file locally and then

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,500
pushing it back to the development

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,600
server through yet but definitely if

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,540
you're using it locally just use the

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,740
standard get convention of branches and

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,740
in court

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
yeah

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,430
oh yeah yeah you always want to make

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,060
sure you have backups if gif isn't

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,230
working for you then for sure one of the

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,300
other things is when you're working

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,240
locally if you have a live version of

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,830
your website you want to make sure that

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,450
you're syncing the live version with the

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,250
local version one thing that I've seen

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,380
go wrong so many times when people are

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,040
working on a site locally as they copy

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,920
down

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,410
the live version to their local and then

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,030
they work on it for a few weeks and then

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,530
they're like okay well how do I push my

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,960
changes back now if you're using

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,900
something like git that's an option but

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,070
if you are just editing a site you don't

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,110
want to make a whole bunch of changes

00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,910
over a long period of time and then have

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,460
your live version of your website become

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,750
completely out of sync and I've seen

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,730
that several times where they say well

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,040
I've made all these changes to the live

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,540
site well someone else was working on

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
the local site or I was making these

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,540
changes on local and these ones online

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
now they're completely incompatible

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,980
there are a few plugins that can help

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,820
with that like there's a site sync

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,190
plug-in there's migrate DB Pro that can

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,160
help with stuff like that so that way

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,630
any Content changes on life can be

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,910
synced back and forth what I like to do

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,510
really is my best practices if I'm

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:40,980
working on changes to a live site

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,540
locally I personally pretty much only do

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,570
that for a certain period of time so

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,280
like if I'm changing the theme like if

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm making major theme edits and I want

00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,360
to work on it locally I'll pull it down

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,900
make no changes to live and then push it

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,450
back up as soon as I'm ready but then I

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,400
also if I do need to work on it for

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,810
longer periods of time and I'm working

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,810
on several parts especially if it

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:07,610
involves changes to content that's where

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,920
having a sync plug-in is is fantastic

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,860
because that way whatever changes are on

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,870
life get synced right back so somebody

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,850
adds a page it goes on there somebody

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,730
changes a page or like some of the

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,560
content it goes on to your local server

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,990
and as long as you've got the plug-in

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,290
running in both places that can really

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,540
save that issue

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,370
but that is that's one of the biggest

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,820
pitfalls that I see with people working

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:37,660
locally is if they you know have a lot

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,780
of changes happen yes oh yeah I like

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,210
sight sync by server press it's a good

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,910
plugin they keep releasing updated

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,710
versions and they actually are the ones

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,860
who make one of the local development

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:55,090
software's

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,400
software pieces that I'm that I'm gonna

00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,350
be showing which is desktop server so

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,390
the question I forgot to reiterate the

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:08,590
question was just if there's a plug-in

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:10,390
that I like for syncing alright one of

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,360
the other best practices is using the

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:17,590
same PHP version as a host this is

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,900
easier in some local development apps as

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,810
opposed to others the reason for this is

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,340
if you're working on something in your

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,730
local development server has like PHP

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,690
7.3 and then you're pushing it to like a

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,100
host that's running like PHP 5.6

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,690
hopefully you're not using a server with

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,780
PHP 5.6 because that one's been

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,700
completely end-of-life but that I'm

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,950
finding there are a lot of hosting

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,380
companies that are still using that so

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,270
for security reasons if your host is on

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,060
PHP 5.6 or lower

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:52,330
talk to your hosts and figure out if

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,000
they're providing long term support on

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,740
that or if if you can get moved up but

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,150
the reason for that is there are several

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,160
functions that have been deprecated

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:04,600
between 5.6 and 7.3 an extra couple that

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,000
have been deprecated even just between

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:12,670
like 7.0 and 7.3 and so one of the

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,010
things I'm seeing is I I manage hundreds

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,470
of sites on a daily basis with my team

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,630
and so we see it all and one of the

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,300
things we see all the time is somebody

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,070
you know has somebody building something

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,230
for them and says yep this is all

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,660
perfect this works they push it to the

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,280
live server and everything breaks and it

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,490
turns out it's because it was being

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,720
developed on either an old more so I see

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,880
that where somebody's developing

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,250
something on an old version of PHP then

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,760
they try to push it to the server where

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,020
some

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,110
these functions are no longer available

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,510
and so if things break because now they

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,640
have to rewrite the program to make sure

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,130
that's the right PHP version so you want

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,380
to find out what your PHP version of

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,500
your host is if you're not familiar with

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,820
using like PHP info or other hosting

00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,770
settings you can usually just contact

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,130
your host and just ask them what's my

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,960
PHP version and that way when you're

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,420
working locally you can make sure that

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,640
you're not using to very out of sync

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:42,550
versions because what may work on one

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:44,620
may not work on the other yeah yeah so

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,230
the plugins are supposed to say what

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,850
version of PHP they work with as well so

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,190
if it's in the WordPress repository it

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,210
should be listed there on what PHP

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,880
version what what the minimum version is

00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:01,270
and so that's one easy way to find out

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,730
yeah so the question was you know what

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,010
about like when you've got like he ran

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,160
into that issue where he had a site that

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,600
the hosts upgraded at PHP seven and then

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,350
it took down the site because something

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,630
was not compatible with PHP seven and so

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,570
yeah your best way to do that is if

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:23,530
you're if your site is up and working or

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,910
even if you're on PHP 5.6 temporarily if

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,160
the host will do that if they'll revert

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,070
it there are some PHP compatibility

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,500
checkers I believe WP engines is still

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,440
out there and that one it'll just check

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,000
for various versions to see you know

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,750
does your theme or do any of your

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,750
plugins have code in them that cause

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,710
that will not work in PHP seven or seven

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,520
one seventy two seventy three and one

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,900
caveat about that is that those PHP

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,510
compatibility checkers cannot figure out

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,490
if something

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,150
in a conditional so if you've got some

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,100
that says you know if this is available

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,790
then run this code otherwise don't run

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,710
it

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,180
these PHP compatibility checkers don't

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,190
have a way to check that they can't run

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,600
that logic so they can't see that like

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,570
oh actually this does work with PHP

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,160
seven it just has a fallback in the code

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,390
so that's just one of the little things

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,740
yeah yeah I think it's just called PHP

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,050
compatibility checker it's just a

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,790
plug-in yeah yeah I've been the

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:28,280
repository last I knew they were still

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:30,980
using that in the latest version of

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,290
WordPress we've also got the site health

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,260
which will warn you about your PHP

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,330
version as well that one doesn't have

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,750
the compatibility checker but there's

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,890
also a site health plug-in that's put

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,080
together by the WordPress core

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,930
contributors and that one does have a

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,790
really cool feature that's called

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,470
troubleshoot and it will actually only

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,240
for the person who's logged in it won't

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:57,710
affect anybody else it will deactivate

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,000
all the plugins and set you back to one

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,670
of the default themes so it'll be like

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,230
2019 theme but that doesn't show to the

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,820
world and so you can actually then turn

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,530
them on one by one to see at what point

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,740
it breaks so that way you don't have to

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:11,810
test those changes on a live site but

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,350
the other option is you know test that

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,360
locally when you're setting up your

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,720
local server choose a PHP version that's

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,580
at least seven at this point at least

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:29,570
7.2 because 7.0 and 7.1 are now now

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:34,070
being phased out so I'm going to compare

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:37,160
a couple of the local server options so

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:41,750
MAMP is one that just by the M the first

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,180
M being Mac it actually does run on

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,690
Windows so this is one that's really

00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,030
popular especially with people who are

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,380
not building WordPress sites which as

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,970
you've seen probably by the numbers

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,990
WordPress is now like almost a third of

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,430
the web and so at this point the number

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,490
of people not building WordPress sites

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,800
is getting less and less unless they're

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,160
you know professionals who are building

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,460
like custom built custom coded sites in

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,050
there

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,070
most likely not using ma'am they're

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,560
going to use one of the other options

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,200
that I show one of the options one of

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,970
the pros is that it is free ma'am does

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,920
have a pro version as well and so the

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,720
free version does work it just doesn't

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,730
have all the features like the ability

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,020
to give it like a domain name and said

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:32,900
it does things by IP but it's it's free

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,370
and it is stable MAMP

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,960
is compared to some of the other options

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,960
it is fairly stable and so that's a

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,480
great one especially if you're on a Mac

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,920
ma'am works really well and you can just

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
keep running keep working on it for

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,690
hours and nothing's gonna break and it

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,790
is cross-platform version 5 is only

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:57,140
available for Mac and version 4 is

00:20:52,790 --> 00:21:00,920
available for Windows it does have some

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:03,410
cons though it does not Auto install

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,660
WordPress which means that you have to

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,270
download and install the WordPress files

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,460
it also does not auto create a database

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:14,960
for you you have to go into PHP myadmin

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,210
and actually create and create that

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,540
database that you want to use and then

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,940
then you can go in there and setup your

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,980
WordPress site so this makes it a little

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,180
less user friendly for WordPress users

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,580
compared to some of the other options

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,340
because it requires several extra stress

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,440
steps it's also not easy to change PHP

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:38,870
versions it is possible but it's not

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,210
easy and so that is just not not a great

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,580
option for if your if you need to test

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:50,510
multiple PHP versions there are some

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:53,360
other options that work much better so a

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:58,370
couple things about using MAMP are just

00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:01,100
that it it has a little weird of an

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,240
interface and so I'm just gonna pull it

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,600
up real quick here you have a question

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,600
in the back

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:13,320
ah yeah

00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:31,970
yeah all right so so with ma'am you just

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,220
saw that startup process is pretty quick

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,270
it's just got it's got the power logo

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:41,750
and it says startup my website and so

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:43,730
you've got your website which right now

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,310
I don't have anything running on ma'am

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,860
but you can access here you've got some

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,820
tools you've got like your PHP info and

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,860
that's where I was talking about like

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,540
you can check your PHP version right

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:59,270
here at the top so this one's running on

00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:00,800
PHP 7.3 and it's this is where you've

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,820
got like that PHP myadmin

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,770
for managing the database so again this

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,540
is stuff that's a little more advanced

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,780
than what some people are comfortable

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:16,220
with if you use PHP myadmin all the time

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,960
you may have no problem with this but if

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,470
you really don't feel like creating your

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,110
own database every time and you know and

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:28,250
installing the files in the right place

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:31,210
and going through the actual like

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,680
editing of files of a certain file to

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,980
choose a different PHP version this may

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,050
not be the best option for you but that

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,060
one as you can see fairly simple to get

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,920
started you click that you install it

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,350
and then as the first thing you see

00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,270
after its installed is that first page

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,980
that first pop-up that I showed where

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,310
you just press the power button that

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,210
says start and server and and then it

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:59,930
just goes they do have a cloud option as

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,450
well which is that one's a monthly paid

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:07,880
version as opposed to the yearly paid

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:10,360
version for man pro but that one it

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,190
worked pretty well I mean cloud is nice

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,620
because you know it gives you access to

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,380
more places than just your local one

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,700
which you can do with MAMP you can

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:24,410
access your site from other places like

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,880
within your network so like if you want

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,280
to check it on your phone you just have

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,970
to do it by IP address

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:35,690
and then use the right port so the next

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,240
one is desktop server this one is really

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,630
popular in the WordPress world but it

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,950
does work for non WordPress as well so

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:48,950
this one is by server press Pro is it

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,850
it's free the free version they have a

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,380
free and paid version like the others

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,730
and so that's always nice if you want to

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,710
get started you're only working on one

00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,690
side or a couple sites you want to just

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,880
try it out without paying for it you can

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,060
try the free one and you get a whole

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,670
bunch of features it really comes only a

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,050
few features you have to pay for usually

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,250
with desktop server what you're what you

00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:14,690
have to pay for is to get more than

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:17,120
three sites desktop server has built-in

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,000
local SSL so that one's great for

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,620
anytime you want to test something that

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,450
requires you know you want to check to

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:29,510
that like HTTP works local SSL is

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:33,500
fantastic for that and really really

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:36,470
necessary it auto installs WordPress

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,140
that ones clutch so you it's just one

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,490
click you choose that you want to use

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,130
that and it will auto install the

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,130
WordPress site for you

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,940
it does have some cons the free version

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:52,400
is limited to three sites you can't

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,370
change the PHP version technically

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,140
that's that's true there you can hack it

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:02,300
to TF different PHP versions but it's

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,300
it's not built in like yeah it's just

00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,070
it's got a PHP version that it's set to

00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,500
and that's what it sticks with unless

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,740
you go and then you're changing the

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,510
configurations so now I'm gonna pull up

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,910
desktop server for you just so you can

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,550
see again so far all I've done on this

00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,620
is installed the software that was it

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,440
didn't do any extra set up so setup is

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,940
really easy first thing is it asks do

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,340
you want to restart desktop server with

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,810
privileges this is because it has to

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,870
make some changes to your computer

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,400
so if you are on a Mac it's gonna make

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,929
you put in a password if you're on

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,330
Windows that depend

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:42,740
whether you have set up the security

00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,490
feature where you have to like approve

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,070
things by an admin but then you can

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,330
start the features it's got a couple

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,580
really cool things that they built

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,710
specifically for themselves which is an

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,779
admin color bar I actually really like

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,429
this one if I'm working on testing

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:01,309
something locally and I've got the live

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,169
site is I can have two tabs or just like

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,029
side-by-side of like working on a site

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,999
like testing on my local server tested

00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,529
on the live one and this changes the

00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:12,169
admin color bar at the top so you can

00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,940
change it it'll like be a different

00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:16,249
color than the WordPress one which is

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,600
really nice because if you're looking

00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:19,610
really quick and you're doing it back

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,259
and forth several times your brain might

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,539
start to mix them up and you forget like

00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,909
Oh which one am i which which one's

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,379
local which one's the right one you so

00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,360
with having different colors it's just a

00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,789
nice cube they have an airplane mode so

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,110
that anything that relies on being

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:37,580
online it'll it'll stop those functions

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,499
so that you don't start getting errors

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:44,330
at because you're disconnected from

00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:46,940
something you've got database archive

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:50,509
you've got debug and trace is a huge one

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,220
when you are fixing a broken site you

00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,440
can turn on debug mode on a live site

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,720
problem with that is that also can give

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,419
away to anybody who might be malicious

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,769
if you put on debug mode live and

00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,690
somebody can see like oh there's this

00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:04,789
error they might be able to exploit that

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,580
error so having a debug and trace to

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:11,659
find the errors on local are really nice

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,309
it has CLI so anyone who's using the

00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,830
command line interface for WordPress and

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:19,879
knows just how incredibly fast you can

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:22,240
do things with WP CLI will love this

00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:24,619
feature it's amazing

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,049
Shawn Hooper is not here this week but

00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:29,749
he's an Ottawa guy who gives a talk on

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:32,149
CLI several times a year and he can show

00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:34,369
you how you can do pretty much

00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:37,190
everything in a WordPress site like 10

00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:39,799
times faster just by using CLI and again

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,320
it's got that local SSL so when you

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,090
start it up for the first time it's

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,240
gonna run through this

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:52,110
the start services and then it'll say

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,990
done and then you just click Next and if

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,610
you have a website it will give you the

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,430
option in the middle which is remove or

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,600
copy or move any of those sites I wanted

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,470
to show you what it looks like the first

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:07,380
time you load it up and so you've got

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,730
create a development site and so this is

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,250
where it's nice you get to choose

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:14,610
whatever domain name you want for it

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:17,310
because it's gonna use dev CC everyone

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,690
used to use dev then Google decided to

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,420
buy it because their Google and they can

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,790
do whatever they want and so dot dev is

00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,340
no longer a safe one to have because

00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,780
that is potentially an actual real site

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:33,300
so you're gonna run into all sorts of of

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,370
DNS issues if you try that so they

00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,670
switched over to dev DC but you can

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:44,430
change it to whatever you want such as

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:46,170
go raptor's dev CC 8 o'clock tomorrow

00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:49,980
night everyone watched they're gonna win

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:54,060
game the next game because Golden State

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:58,380
Warriors are overrated and so the one

00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:01,980
thing about this is right now it's on

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,800
the latest version of WordPress but one

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,500
thing with desktop servers it does come

00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,140
with whatever version is like at the

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,820
time that they put out the version of

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,350
desktop server and so it can start to

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,510
get outdated so one thing to keep in

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:18,060
mind is when you choose that you're

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,710
probably need to update the site as soon

00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,630
as you start it up otherwise you may end

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,520
up with an out-of-date version but

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,140
you've also got the option so if you

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
choose the WordPress version it'll

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,580
install the database it will install

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,710
WordPress and you can just get started

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,840
just like you're working on your local

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,780
on your live site where you've installed

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,390
WordPress but it also has the blank

00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:43,020
option which is really nice if you want

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:46,260
to use something else like I do a lot of

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,570
presentations where I use reveal Jas and

00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,730
I actually use desktop server for that

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,680
when I'm testing it out and so things

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,430
like that

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,110
anytime you're building a side that's

00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,840
non WordPress or you just want to

00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,860
install directly from what you have like

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,600
maybe you wanted old

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,580
version of WordPress you can choose the

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,330
blank version and then it's gonna show

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,679
you right there where your files are

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,520
that'll change depending on you know

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,470
what person is you can choose different

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,710
places so if you want to drop your

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,840
website somewhere else you can do that

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:22,850
and one thing I like to do with that is

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,380
sometimes I will drop it in my Dropbox

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,690
so that way it's just automatically

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,120
adding a backup same with iCloud or

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,799
Google Drive you can drop it right in

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,090
there and that way your files are just

00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,760
automatically being backed up to the

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,160
cloud as you work on them so then when

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,669
you just hit create it runs through this

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,160
thing and then it's going to tell you

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:51,419
that your website is ready to go so it's

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:53,580
this one has a few more steps and so

00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,250
right now there's nothing there because

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,450
I chose the do not install WordPress

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,510
versions I didn't feel like going

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,669
through the whole thing but other than

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,020
that when you're done with that it'll

00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,860
just give you the option to remove a

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:09,360
website again you can stop the services

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:16,950
which is what I'm gonna do because I

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,410
have one more to show up so as you can

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,000
see MAMP was definitely of the three

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,490
that I'm showing today MAMP was the most

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,980
difficult to work with in terms of like

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,470
technical stuff desktop has the most

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,530
number of options which can be seen as a

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,940
plus or minus the the one minus of that

00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,470
is that you have to go through like

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,860
several steps to get your WordPress site

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:41,010
set up so the other option to talk about

00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:42,600
is local by flywheel so this one is by a

00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:46,169
hosting company which makes it a little

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,270
bit unique and it does have an extra

00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:49,620
feature in that it's connected to

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,710
flywheel so if you're a flywheel

00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,400
customer this may be the best option for

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,940
you

00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,090
but again local by flywheel is free and

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:03,510
you can change the PHP version you can

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,250
also switch between nginx and Apache so

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,570
depending on which how you want to like

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,000
you have what engine you want to use for

00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,360
your site and you can change your my

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,020
sequel version so that's

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,840
super-nice this really gives you a nice

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:21,080
like graphical interface but gives you a

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,179
lot of flexibility so you can really try

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,130
and match your live server and these

00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,540
ones right here the PHP versions it

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,090
gives you the my sequel versions and

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,809
jumping between nginx and Apache you can

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,610
match pretty much most like every of the

00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:37,010
main hosting companies you can match

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:40,160
whatever your live server has so if your

00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,920
live server has PHP 7.1 you can change

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,530
that if it's running nginx you can

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,059
change that and same with like the my

00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,929
sequel version if that's if they're on

00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:52,790
5.5 you can move these around that's

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,350
really nice and that's really clutch if

00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,690
you have a site where there's a

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,640
potential that what you're working on

00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,350
locally might not work in the live site

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,650
if you can match it like you can with

00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,600
flywheel it's really just it eases you

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,060
because you know that like yep you've

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,129
got the same software behind the scenes

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,820
running it so when you push it to live

00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:14,990
nothing's gonna break on you hopefully I

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,760
always say hopefully because I can't say

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,960
nothing's gonna break on you WordPress

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,270
is always fun like that

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,530
actually that's all web development

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:25,190
something works fine for six months you

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:27,460
test it over and over thank you and and

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:31,310
then you push live and something breaks

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,960
so I don't want to make any promises the

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:38,030
one thing about local by flywheel is

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,220
that uses VirtualBox the one somewhat a

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,820
know anything like with running that is

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,409
that if you try and run multiple sites

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,020
there's a potential that you're gonna

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,000
overload your computer because that can

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,760
get really resource heavy really quick

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,540
if you're running like you know like a

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,330
eight core processor and like 16 or 32

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:02,450
gigs of ram have at it have opened up 10

00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,060
sites you should be good local by

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:07,670
flywheel not I don't want to disparage

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,340
anyone but it's been known to be not

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,560
stable it'll work fine like you started

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,530
up ten times in a row and it works fine

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,030
and then on number 11 it might not work

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,640
and all you have to do is just reinstall

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:23,690
it the problem with that is it you're

00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,430
losing time and you know if you need it

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,319
in a in a crunch like you're about to

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,630
show somebody like present the website

00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,040
there's a chance it may not run it's

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,220
been a while since that happened to me

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,760
where I opened up local by flywheel in

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,230
it and it just didn't run but it happens

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,150
and it's kind of a known thing you'll

00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,559
see it on Twitter a lot but everyone

00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,550
loves to complain on Twitter so I only

00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:48,530
kind of take that for what it is so the

00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:52,640
last that's the last one I'm actually

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:54,200
going to show you and so this is what

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,369
the startup process again this is what

00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,930
it will look like right when you've

00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:01,190
installed local is so right now it's

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,589
starting the local machine starting

00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,950
VirtualBox so this one takes a little

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:11,480
bit longer to actually start up but it's

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,980
the easiest to set up so I find it is oh

00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,980
this would be ironic if this was the

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:26,210
time it doesn't start - starting to

00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:27,800
question whether it's gonna do that this

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,400
could be my fault because I oh there we

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,680
go I say because I'm jumping between

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,510
local servers so I might have just

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,450
overloaded it a little bit so real quick

00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,099
you got super easy you don't have a site

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,869
there so it'll just tell you straight up

00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,190
there are a couple things here you think

00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,720
this is where you connected to flywheel

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,329
so if you've got a flywheel hosting

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,790
account you like pull and push back

00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:56,180
between that which is really nice and so

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,230
they've got a couple of add-ons I'm not

00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,150
gonna actually do the internet right now

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,809
so I don't have the options they aren't

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:05,030
really anything that that I've ever used

00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:06,890
anyway there's only like two add-ons

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,319
last I checked but it's super easy

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,900
create a new site you can just choose

00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:16,930
the name so go Bruins

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,400
and so it gives you a couple of options

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,310
in the Advanced Options but you don't

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,040
have to use them so that's like for

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,890
example you can change the domain by

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,780
default local uses dot local because

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,900
that one's also currently not a

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,250
top-level domain I would not count on

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,510
that though because that seems like

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,000
something that somebody is going to

00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:41,470
start selling dot local so don't plan

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,870
everything based around that but they'll

00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,310
also let you know because when they when

00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:49,870
everyone had to switch from using dot

00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:53,550
dev it was fairly painless they created

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:56,440
things in there you can just like the

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,930
just like desktop server you can choose

00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,030
where your files go and you can use a

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,580
blueprint in this case it's a little bit

00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,590
different you can actually you can

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,720
create blueprints which is nice too so

00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:11,460
if you are repeatedly spinning up

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:16,510
similar sites you can use that within

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:18,550
local which is really nice so you've got

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,290
this option which is the preferred which

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:24,400
is just their default and they're

00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:27,640
defaulting toward to PHP 7.29

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,530
and they are using by default nginx they

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,960
are using varnish cache so that's one

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:38,740
thing to keep an eye out for super easy

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:40,300
to clear out though and my sequel 5.7 it

00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,310
does give you all these options on which

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:47,800
is super nice it goes all the way down

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:50,530
to to PHP 5.2 please don't build the

00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:56,740
site on 5.2 you are so gonna be hacked

00:38:50,530 --> 00:39:04,660
and so it it lets you choose all the way

00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:07,120
up to 7.2 I believe it'll do 7.9 is like

00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,910
the default so 7.2 dot zero is the

00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,210
lowest so they don't have 7.3 on there

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:15,760
yet but you can jump between nginx and

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,560
Apache which is really nice because if

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,420
you're running nginx most of these other

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,690
local ones are only gonna run Apache and

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,110
so I so to be able to have that just so

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,560
you can duplicate it and say if

00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:30,920
sure that's so nice and then you've got

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,410
my sequel 5.6 and 5.5 has available

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,650
options for custom it's going to default

00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:40,970
to 5.7 this is where it gets super easy

00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,950
right away so rather than you having to

00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,860
go through the normal wordpress install

00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:49,270
page like you normally do anytime you

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:52,610
install WordPress you can totally just

00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:55,160
create this and don't use the username

00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:57,080
admin when actually creating a site and

00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,850
also I use the password admin but this

00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,600
is local so I'm not ever gonna put this

00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,650
online nobody can ever access it but

00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,600
those are just a couple things keep in

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,370
mind always use a very strong secure

00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,170
password don't use any words in it and

00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,520
never use the username admin because

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,150
that's the number one that BOTS are

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,890
always trying to hack you can set up a

00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:18,380
multi WordPress multi-site install for

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:21,260
both subdirectory and sub domain so this

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,550
one is really nice and you can also do

00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,080
that in desktop server I forgot to

00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:28,610
mention that that you can set up

00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,650
multi-site which is really convenient

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:33,050
I believe multi-site only works in the

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:37,450
pro version of desktop server they're

00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:41,570
both like a hundred dollars a year for

00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:44,000
form amp Pro and desktop server so it's

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,740
not too bad but this is what you get

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,420
once you've created the site it gives

00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,640
you all this information which is really

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,030
nice none of the others make it quite

00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,690
this easy it shows you your PHP version

00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:58,610
it gives you the ability to change so if

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,010
you've like started on one version of

00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,350
PHP you actually change it while you're

00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,420
working on the site and then you just

00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,910
restart it that's super nice nobody else

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,370
does that

00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:14,090
and so that is it's not going to let me

00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:16,610
do that right now yeah so that's that's

00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:19,190
a really nice option and then very

00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:23,000
quickly you've got access to your

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:25,490
database they use admin turn and so

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,740
that's just a really easy way to manage

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,530
your database you've got again the local

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,420
SSL which is nice and you've got mail

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,130
hog so this lets you if you're doing

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,270
something that sends emails this

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,680
actually lets you check

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,140
so that way you can see like did the

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,430
email actually send that's great when

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,750
you're dealing with like WooCommerce

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,420
sites where you need to make sure that

00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,510
all those emails go out properly and

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,970
then when you click a pin it will just

00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:53,369
bring you right to the login and so as

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,560
you saw I didn't have to actually like

00:41:53,369 --> 00:42:01,170
create anything on the site it's just

00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:07,109
there so that is it for local by

00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:08,760
flywheel so really that's a real quick

00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:12,180
just gonna mention docker is like the

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,369
pro version to use docker is fantastic

00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,550
because you can actually perfectly match

00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:20,670
pretty much any server you want it does

00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:22,140
require a lot of setup so this is one

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,690
the reason I'm not showing this this is

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,069
one like if you are like a high-end dev

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,650
you're building stuff that needs really

00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:31,380
custom you can run multiple containers

00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,589
easily so if you're using something that

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,650
is using endpoints docker is great for

00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:40,530
that because you can run both ends of of

00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:43,290
whatever software you're setting up it's

00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,930
difficult to set up and it is unstable

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,760
at times mostly it'll just it'll

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,020
overload the site or overload your

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,450
server depending on what you've got

00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,150
going on but that's really any time

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,890
you're running multiple things so not

00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,089
really gonna talk much about docker but

00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,349
check it out if you're looking for

00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:59,940
something that's more robust than those

00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:01,470
ones I think you only have like one

00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,060
minute for questions do I have any

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,060
questions yes

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:48,770
yep so for Linux there are I believe

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,270
desktop server I don't know that they've

00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,680
put it out yet they they have been

00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:56,599
working on a on a Linux version yeah

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,340
last I knew they were at least it was

00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,580
discussed I don't know what the status

00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,790
is on that really on Linux I like to use

00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:07,910
vagrant personally yeah just because in

00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:10,250
vagrant I find are in Linux I find that

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:13,160
that's the best option usually when I'm

00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,690
doing local development if I'm using a

00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,820
Linux server it's usually an external

00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,550
one so I'm I'm actually running it as an

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,109
Ubuntu server so I find that works best

00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,460
is just a run up on to server when

00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,700
you're working locally that's just

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:30,770
really nice yeah

00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:32,869
any other questions all right well thank

00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:35,020
you very much I'll be hanging around all

00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:35,020
day

00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:42,809
