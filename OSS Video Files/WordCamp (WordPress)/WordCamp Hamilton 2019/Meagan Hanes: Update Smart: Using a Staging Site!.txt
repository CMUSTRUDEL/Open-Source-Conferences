Title: Meagan Hanes: Update Smart: Using a Staging Site!
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	Performing theme, plugin and core updates on your site can be intimidating and overwhelming, especially for older and more complex sites with many interconnected plugins – Woocommerce, I’m looking at you!
The solution is simple: use a staging site – a private copy of your site where you can safely test updates and resolve problems before your users ever experience an issue.
I’ll guide you across a number of ways to create a staging site depending on your specific needs, performing these updates, and then applying these updates to your main site. You’ll leave with a concrete plan for how to set up your own staging site, and will fear the update process far less!

all right as my love William

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,300
just said my name is Megan hi

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,740
we'll be talking to you guys about how

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,090
to update smart by using a save insight

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,420
I'll start off have has this ever

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:27,789
happened to anyone show of hands up live

00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:30,310
demo yes

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,840
and now side note nowadays of new

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,400
WordPress you shouldn't see this as much

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,040
but it's instead you'll get a really

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,559
weird email that scares you even more

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,050
than this like screen of death does

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,440
don't try some actual site what's the

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,059
answer

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,300
well you gotta use a staging site dingus

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,780
it's the entire point of my talk is long

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,910
term then boiled down if you want to do

00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,230
updates safely and securely don't do

00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,640
them on the actual site don't want to

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,140
copy the site safely so let's start from

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,619
the top and work your way down shall we

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,910
what is a staging site a staving site is

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:11,590
basically a private copy of your website

00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,240
ideally on the same server or a very

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,049
similar stack so that you don't

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,510
encounter problems basically it has no

00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:21,570
visibility from Google so you've turned

00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,680
off in that little section the

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,930
discourage search engines from indexing

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
that's turned off sometimes you can even

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,900
have a password blocking access to the

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,939
entire site and the term staging is in

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,979
contrast of the term production or live

00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,900
so you have your live site that's the

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,880
one that's online right now all the

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,159
users are interacting with it you're

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,470
making sales people are posting on your

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,140
forums and then you have a staging site

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,470
just like a stage on stage behind the

00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,740
curtain where you can do all your tests

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,720
perform all your updates and not muck

00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,189
anything up for the live users actually

00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,220
using your site so why do we use saving

00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:06,460
sites basically we use staging sites to

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,340
keep our website healthy without having

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,070
the risks of updating right on life the

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,140
simple fact of WordPress is websites get

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,570
hacked because people don't update

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,750
plugins they don't update themes and

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,370
they don't update their core software

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,230
and I can understand why I've dealt with

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,450
hundreds of websites they're complicated

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,700
were there late and you don't want to

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,590
touch that it's kind of like it's good

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,989
I'm gonna romp okay let's set it and

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,690
forget it and hope nothing breaks the

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,030
problem with that is it's not a matter

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,730
of if it's a matter of what if you don't

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,010
update regularly you'll have this giant

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,420
backlog that when you do update you're

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,780
gonna have all these bugs and you'll be

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,060
discouraged doing it live is not the

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,920
best way though because if you apply an

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,260
update and it causes a problem on your

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,640
site and your site's down well now

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,830
you're in panic mode and then the

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,080
adrenaline gets flowing and it's hard to

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,420
code when you're shaking because you

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,190
don't know what's going on so that's why

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,190
we use stating sites the staging sites

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,150
we also use staging sites to perform

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,860
updates very very carefully like I said

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,260
you're doing these updates not on the

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,750
live site but your copy of your site you

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,690
can go slowly through the updates you

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,519
can actually read the update notes show

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,299
hands who read the last patch update

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,280
notes that they applied exactly we have

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,810
are busy people we don't have time to

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,180
read these notes but sometimes you'll

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,950
discover brand new feature that you

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,389
didn't know about or a new

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,400
incompatibility that's going to be a

00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,260
problem when you're not rushing to

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,970
update things on a live site

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,000
you have time to actually delete those

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,739
notes and then you can test thoroughly

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,380
without like polluting and mucking up

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,510
your life site data this is important

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,100
especially if you're doing e-commerce

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,780
you'll want to know you're applying your

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,480
updates to WooCommerce you don't make

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,340
sure people can still purchase a product

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,319
but you don't want to have the actual

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,670
money account from your account you

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,130
don't want to have a fake order that

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,900
your company's actually now rushing to

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,109
fulfill because they didn't know that it

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,760
was on a saving site so by doing our

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,220
updates on the staging site you can test

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,349
thoroughly you can you could make

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,989
hundred orders you could do pretty much

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,459
anything you needed to and then it will

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:24,020
not affect a live site when you go to

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,760
apply your updates and we use saving

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,940
sites because they eliminate mixed

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,510
stakes and downtime so if you're on your

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,330
staging site and you update your plug-in

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,060
there's a problem style great you're not

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,370
on your life site your users don't know

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,040
there are doing purchases there off in

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,900
the forums they have no idea that you're

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,270
currently trying to figure out why this

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,210
poor plugin update has crashed your site

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,760
oh this is super important for any sites

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,760
that are actively doing e-commerce

00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:00,169
because a site down mate that gets

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,340
attention of the higher-ups that you

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:06,889
don't necessarily want to have similarly

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,900
there could be problems in updates that

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,210
 your SEO and you don't know

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,520
because you didn't thoroughly check you

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,229
didn't read the notes you're just kind

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,000
of doing that and you don't know that

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,220
there's a problem there until two months

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,870
later when your CEO comes in just like

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,150
why are the sales stopped on the website

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,979
why don't have leads Oh

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,260
turned out it was actually a form that

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,080
now needs a CAPTCHA but you didn't know

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,240
because yet rushed it through these can

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,930
all be avoided by following the

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,729
methodology of a saging site okay so we

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,979
talked a lot about why we want to use

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,560
staging sites I'm sure half of you are

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:45,140
like okay I'm down with this how do you

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,840
actually create a staging site so we're

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:52,340
gonna go through a variety of ways so

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,130
one of the first is that you can create

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,750
a staging site is by using the backup

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,740
plug-in that you already have installed

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:04,210
and the reason that I put this number

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,860
one is for a really good reason

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,990
basically if you already have a backup

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,910
plug-in installed on your site it's

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,669
already performing your backups in the

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,080
case where your site gets hacked know

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,960
how to restore your site frozen that

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,669
back up that's a big question and again

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,950
when things go wrong that's when the

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:24,410
nerves happen so you couldn't you use

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,060
your backup plug-in take the back of it

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,590
mate and create your state in site right

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,110
from there you'll get better at knowing

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,700
how your backup plugin works you'll be

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,370
able to create the staging site with no

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,380
problem and then at times many of your

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,840
client sites will have one of these

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,750
installed so you don't actually have to

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,360
put on a plug-in get into the the core

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,350
of the files just go with something that

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,350
they already have running

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,160
you can also create a staging site by

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,560
using your web hosts so it depends on

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,380
what host you're on and what plan you're

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,900
on inside that host but many hosts do

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,669
include one stick one-click staging

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,560
where essentially you're on your

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,210
WordPress dashboard or their dashboard

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,729
there's literally a button that says

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,190
create a staging site what that does is

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,410
copy your live site into the little

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,460
password-protected area where you can

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:22,849
then make your changes some of the most

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,349
of the premium WordPress dedicated hosts

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:29,900
like WP engine liquid web flywheel

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,430
SiteGround they have this built in some

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,830
of the other ones like GoDaddy and a2

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,259
hosting needs beyond their managed

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,889
WordPress plan as opposed to being on

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:42,349
their generic $5 plan you may or may not

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,820
get a staging site at that level but

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,389
once you get up to the point of paying

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:51,759
15 $20 a month for your hosting they

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,759
usually have backup or built-in staging

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:59,930
so there's also another option again I'm

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:02,360
giving you options up 70 you can use a

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,169
staging site service such as w3

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,120
stagecoach comp not affiliated what this

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,580
does is they give you a plugin that you

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,650
from your site and then with one click

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,680
again it creates a clone of your site on

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,370
their own servers so it's a little

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,610
different because it's a different

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,280
server stack and this side is actually

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,289
automatically deleted 14 days or so if

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,169
you don't interact with it or update it

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:30,650
so it's very temporal it's it's it's

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,440
there for you to test with not for it to

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,190
be there and lingering and we'll talk

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,690
about the risks of having a permanent

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,690
staging site in a little bit

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,070
now this option is not free it does come

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,830
with a little bit but generally it's

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,420
it's an affordable level and a caveat

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,000
that it does not work with multi-sites

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,610
so if you're dealing with multi-site at

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,620
that point you're probably on a higher

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,920
tier of hosting which will have a built

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:07,029
in staging site anyone not know what

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,130
multi-site is basically it just means

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,680
you have a parent WordPress I need to

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,380
create little tile board from that

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,380
parent WordPress tile confidently say

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:26,200
another way to create a saving site is

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,630
to manually clone the site but that's

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,420
how you learn the grid ease of WordPress

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,930
I always recommend to everyone to do

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,170
this once

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,080
so that if you'd say you did it and then

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,360
find a better more efficient way but

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,940
that's how you learn right we learn and

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,190
we're oppressed by trial and error you

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,750
read a book through the code and that's

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,270
how you learn

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,670
you basically just copy over your files

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:54,760
copy over the database do a little Find

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,920
and Replace to change the URL so the the

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,209
current staving site and then you've got

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,209
a copy of your site ready to go

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,980
another option for creating a staging

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,779
site there are many options is you can

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,410
create a site that's only accessible on

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:18,420
your local machine you can use tools

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,410
like local by flywheel or desktop server

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,720
server press

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:28,080
Lancel services that you can use as well

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,790
but they basically do is they'll install

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,760
we'll set up a little mini server on

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,310
your computer the benefits of this are

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,190
that your site's not live it's not

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,920
online no one will ever chance upon it

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,390
because they have to be on your computer

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,290
or like physically on your network it's

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:49,230
not gonna happen the con to that is it's

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,210
not identical to your server so there

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,340
could be issues where you're applying a

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,410
plugin it looks fine on your local

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,990
machine but then you apply the plug-in

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,170
on them because they're not running the

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,980
same PHP they're not running the same

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:08,040
server can be a fatality is work but

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,470
generally speaking for most for 99% of

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,960
people a local site is a very good

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,490
option especially if you're an indie

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,370
developer and you don't actually have to

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:24,840
pass the site between QA and

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:28,650
back-and-forth problems okay so we've

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,840
talked about what a staging site is we

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,240
talked about a number of ways that you

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,390
can actually implement a state insight

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,210
so let's quickly go over the workflow

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,670
this is just a general sample workflow I

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,130
tried to make the most broadly

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,420
applicable across all the different

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:51,330
varieties of options start up like that

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,490
you go clockwise so basically you

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,150
identify items need an update on your

00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:00,450
live site you create an update plan okay

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,820
today I'm gonna move commerce and update

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,330
all of the WooCommerce applicable child

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,440
plugins if I'm not going to update

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,480
buddypress and those because I want to

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,020
make it easy for myself reduce some

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,880
options of variables then you perform

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,490
those updates one at a time on your

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,250
staging site the reason I say one at a

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,490
time is again we have the luxury of time

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,160
so you can step through things one at a

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,910
time apply the update make sure nothing

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,290
is broke then roll out the child updates

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,530
again verify that those haven't broken

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,530
anything

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,040
test each plugins functionality very

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,150
very thoroughly actually submit data go

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,310
through the full flow

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,550
don't just load a page and okay it loads

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:54,340
actually step there use Yost's to check

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:57,010
a keyword make a purchase then go make

00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,230
sure it actually worked correctly and

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,660
then you perform those same plug-in

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,340
updates on the live site so we're not

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,670
actually taking anything on the staging

00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,830
site moving it so that is an option if

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,830
you wish and if your workflow is good

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,290
and simple enough which is it doesn't

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,360
have ongoing orders it doesn't have a

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,510
forum where people are constantly adding

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,970
new data there's a brochure website like

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,100
for a mom-and-pop shop you can totally

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,830
perform the updates on staging and then

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,040
just push the entire site right back up

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,810
you use a backup plug-in to ramai great

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,870
in the site just like you've migrated

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:40,180
it's down to saving this is a template

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,890
every sites the same sometimes you can't

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,780
migrate the site over again because of

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,730
WooCommerce or data sometimes but

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,170
sometimes we have to do a lot more

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,940
plugin updates at once because we've got

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,610
a lot of backlog that we need to get

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:59,080
through so this is a good template to go

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:02,530
from and here are some questions that

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,910
you can ask yourself about staging sites

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:09,010
before you get into the actual work and

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,410
this is based on my struggles and trials

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:15,430
so you can benefit and not have to

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,170
struggle like me wise questions you

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,780
should consider number one whose job is

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,790
this like who's gonna do this work if

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,610
you're a solopreneur 4 you'll answer

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,280
well obviously it's you if you're a part

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,440
of a larger company where you you are

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,810
the IT division but you may have a

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,750
marketing manager as well then you need

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:37,290
to discuss who is going to actually be

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,490
responsible for making these updates

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,920
determine how often will they be

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,810
performed are you doing updates every

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,440
week is once a month

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:50,730
enough is every two weeks

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,009
I don't ever recommend updating beyond

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,480
pushing it past one month because again

00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,000
you start building technical debt behind

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,940
you the whole point of this is to make

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,449
easy to do these updates and stay caught

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:09,550
up on the string and then schedule this

00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:11,529
ask in calendar firmly put it in pen it

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,839
is not a meeting that gets pushed on

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,750
something better coming up because that

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,339
is that's the desk cry of a website as

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,949
when Oh we'll get to it later

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,160
we'll get to it later it gets hacked and

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:28,870
then rebuilt and then everyone hit

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,839
WordPress even I make sure that another

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,910
question to consider is so I pay someone

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,850
else to do this and the answer may very

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,519
well be yes if you have a company large

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,529
enough such that your time spent

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,199
managing and dealing with the upload is

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,839
a bad investment it would be better for

00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,620
you to develop websites than Tomatoes

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,620
there are plenty of companies there are

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,389
local ones there are ones in Canada and

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,910
the states there are companies that are

00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,189
global that will help you do this and

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,620
one of the benefits to kind of going

00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:05,620
with that is that you've got a roster of

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,750
experts there to help you in the case

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,910
where a plug-in has a problem because

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,680
that's where the difficulty gets okay

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,009
I've applied the plugin I need enough

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,420
debug why it's having a problem that can

00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,490
just start taking hours and hours of

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,069
your day if you're not a developer

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,630
minded person who's excited about when

00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:28,420
things go wrong which is like 1 in

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:32,259
10,000 many maintenance services also

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,720
include daily weekly backups so it's

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,689
easy to pitch to the higher-ups in that

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,430
regard and like I say it frees up

00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:42,250
internal resources for the more

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,230
important work if your job is selling

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,449
widgets you don't want to be spending

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,819
all your time cleaning up the production

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:52,839
floor and you can hire a robot to do

00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:54,040
that it's certainly well the purpose of

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,829
the sock is to teach you how to do a

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,600
staving site so I watch all the try and

00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,920
make it happen a few times

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,190
and then look back at it and just be

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,290
realistic is this worth my time to do

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,610
you may find that you love doing this to

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,920
the point where you can start a

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,500
maintenance business it's not that

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,830
complicated to do in terms of there are

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,780
always new websites being produced and

00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,520
you can make a business offering that

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,470
suits what you can do and what you're

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,640
willing to provide whether it comes with

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,800
a development hour a month whether

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,170
whether the backup sump are frequent etc

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:34,780
etc so this is a good option to look

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:40,870
into from both sides and I have a few

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:42,960
bonus bonus super bonus tips for your

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,660
savings items things to think about

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,700
bonus tip number one change your

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,320
dashboard color yeah I have a picture of

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,050
a live site and a picture of my staging

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,110
site which is which well I don't look at

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:59,170
the URLs they're a little different this

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,710
is much easier I know I'm on the staging

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,450
site because it is very red and that you

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,360
know you may think okay that's it's just

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,520
simple it's it's nothing but when you're

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,290
nine in the morning debugging a plug-in

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
that's got a problem and you see that

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,280
red screen pop up you know you're on the

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,810
right site very commonly what you'll do

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,820
is I'm updating a plug-in now I'm

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,110
reproducing that change on the live site

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
and I don't know which I've gotten

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,700
confused we're going back and forth I've

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,190
copied code from here over there it can

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,700
be very frustrating stuff this is built

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,500
into the WordPress profile if you see

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,920
right down here I'll the users your

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,110
profile there are eight color themes so

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,690
pick one that's not default there are

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:48,310
plugins to add other ones if you are not

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:51,720
satisfied with this range of colors and

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,980
my final bonus tip is nuke it with fire

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,380
so this is what happens often when

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,410
you'll have a staging site okay great

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm doing my testing on here meanwhile

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,850
my marketing department is working on

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,890
their new offering so they're writing

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,300
content they don't want it to go live on

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,520
the site yet so they're just testing on

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,500
the staging site and then we have

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,580
problems because we've got content on

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,520
the staging site

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,870
that we need to have on a live site it

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,510
should be on the live site but this

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,300
tried to being smart like doing all

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,280
their work behind the scenes that's got

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,980
a problem because I don't know what

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,320
situation is I don't know that context

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,450
exists without somebody telling me or

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,930
having a plug-in installed that

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,260
literally logs whatever anyone does so

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:40,630
again it's just it's frustrating I've

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,340
literally got from that third line many

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,290
times from clients where I'm saying I'm

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,550
doing plug-in updates I'm gonna take

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,060
away your staging site and I go notice

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,250
or know we have valuable content on this

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,620
the best policy I can find is to

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,130
literally make it a company policy that

00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,610
staging site is a temporary thing it can

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,560
disappear at any time so if you are if

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,160
you're choosing to work on new marketing

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,660
content work I'm not on Google Docs you

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,450
can test it on the staging site but know

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,390
that that will never make it to live

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,130
until you do that you'll get people in

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,840
the company because no no you can do

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,730
this that's just code you got to stand

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,790
straight and just be like no this is the

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,470
way I'm going to be but of course

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,140
perform a backup of the site before you

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,940
nuke it anyway so that one CEO comes and

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:35,440
goes well you delete it the marketing

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:36,970
content you've got to look for second

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,490
last slide is a promo for word camp

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,440
Ottawa you like word camp you're here

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,860
have you ever considered coming to

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,320
Ottawa we have a work camp - it's our

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,050
just on sale now here's July 13th 14th

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,450
this year at Carleton University speaker

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,370
application is still open if you have

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,100
never spoke if you want to be up here

00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,100
telling me your juicy secrets I want to

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,280
hear them please consider it come on out

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,380
it's gonna be a lot of fun this yeah and

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,930
now I'm gonna open this up for a whole

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,360
question a whole bunch of any questions

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,480
that you'd like staging sites or

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,330
something even somewhat related who's

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,200
got the first question I have prizes for

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,200
people who ask questions

00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:26,029
yes mm-hm

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,970
move

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,490
so if you know again every if it's a

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,250
smaller site and you're the only one

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,740
making those changes you can choose at

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,320
that time - my dream I great the site

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,420
back so I'll use a backup plug-in to

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,910
make a backup of the sites take the

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,400
existing one change the subdomains to a

00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,800
different URL then reinstall WordPress

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,750
from that backup that'll usually those

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,420
backup plugins come with a tool that

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,150
does the database search and replace and

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,380
the reason I suggest that is because

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,950
reproducing those media re-uploading it

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,690
is too tiring that's in turn work it's

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,820
not your work

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:19,900
like I say using a backup plug-in to

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,520
restore the site is like a 1 - you get

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,540
the site done and you'll learn how to do

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,550
it in the case of a fire if you'd like

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,650
to have a price please I have a few

00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,750
maintain shirts available like one in

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:35,710
three sizes I also have a pop pocket and

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,010
some stickers because much is great next

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,010
question

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:53,900
sure thing yes

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,260
mm-hm

00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,090
hmm

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:33,350
mmm

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,350
[Music]

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,030
yeah absolutely so there always be plug

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,500
in every developer has their own opinion

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,220
on what plugin is good we're plugging

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,140
this bad

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,809
some people love vault press some people

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,390
hate automatic some people love backup

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:19,809
buddy some people love manual EFT peeing

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,570
everything there your job as a website

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:25,659
creator is is to come in with the bag of

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,299
tools so backup buddy and updraftplus

00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:30,340
and manual thing can be three tools in

00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:33,400
your tool set that you apply depending

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,770
on what the situation is I've faced

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,570
limited hosting as well where yeah your

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,120
standard workflow just is not an option

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:44,169
so at that point you start looking into

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,510
other options um a lot of the plugins

00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:48,010
share basic commonality it's just the

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,870
skinning that's different it's the

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,140
approach or the actual methodology

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,289
steps that are a little different so use

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,299
the time to explore two or three tools

00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,760
pick whichever one works for you

00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:03,400
whichever to work for you and just kind

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,720
of always keep a little feeler for how

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,000
people are thinking what's the new

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,710
update plugin that's coming out and it's

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,710
cool maybe I'll give that one a try

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,799
mm-hmm so you can use your current

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,899
website make a sub-domain

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,960
like plug in through FTP or through your

00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:26,629
cPanel make a new folder from my website

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,299
calm slash my test sites and then you'll

00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:30,619
restore the backup into that and just

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:37,029
follow all the documentation on the

00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:37,029
backups so well guide you through next I

00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:51,349
I love using the staging sites built in

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:52,879
syncing because they they tend to be

00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,919
when you're dealing with a managed

00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:57,440
WordPress smells like WP engine they've

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,090
got really good systems for creating

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,830
those staging sites you can even push it

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,749
back up if you're confident that again

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,639
no database changes is gonna be lost and

00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:09,019
I think you can push your staging site

00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:11,720
to life very great and easy I like to

00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,639
prefer to work with the hosts built in

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,129
version just because in case there's a

00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:18,889
problem like a literal them under the

00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:22,309
bus III loss the port ticket and I say

00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:24,859
hey you're stating site tool bro guide

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:27,009
me through this I don't have to pay and

00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:32,499
how early fee

00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:32,499
next question yes

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,200
you can choose to you could always

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,950
purchase a domain if you wanted to often

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,870
staging sites we'll just so what WP

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,169
engine your actual account name is my

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,000
weird account name WP engine comm that's

00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,409
hidden nobody sees that they visit

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,960
Meghan Haney's com

00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,850
what WP engine does is it just makes a

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,940
little different site there so it's

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:04,390
Meghan's cool site got staging WP engine

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,130
calm and it's got the same server so

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,870
you're not going to encounter bugs where

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,210
oh I'm running a different version of

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,659
PHP it worked fine I'm testing and now

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,250
it's not I do not get any I have no

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,929
affiliates of other than my company I

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:23,620
don't get any kickbacks for recommending

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:26,580
anyone any other question no all right

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,580
