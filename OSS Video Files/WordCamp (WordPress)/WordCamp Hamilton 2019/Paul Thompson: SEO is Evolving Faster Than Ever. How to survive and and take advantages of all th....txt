Description: 
	Does it feel like keeping up with SEO has been a wild ride the past year?
The one constant in SEO is change, but the past 12 months have been especially turbulent. And the rapid pace of change promises to continue. Hard to know which changes to pay attention to and what to do about them
Voice Search? Mobile-First Index? E-A-T and algorithm updates? Site speed? Structured Data and Schema? Major changes to SEO Tools (Hello, Yoast SEO and Google Search Console!)
Whew.
You’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed. We’ll get right into the nitty-gritty of understanding how we need to adjust our thinking and adapt our WordPress sites, content and processes to succeed in this new reality, while maintaining our sanity. And slay a few sacred cows in the process.
We’ll particularly focus on the needs of small business sites, bloggers and small to medium, e-commerce sites while keeping the jargon under control.

	00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,220
I'm actually getting a real kick out of

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,600
being

00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,220
camp again this year I grew up in

00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,890
Hamilton I used to walk right by this

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,440
building every day on my way

00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,320
every day so this is this is kind of a

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,350
neat homecoming I've been working with

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,640
WordPress since about 2009 I've been on

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,380
the web since 1996 which makes me kind

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,020
of one of the old farts in in this area

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,940
of the industry but what keeps me

00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,190
fascinated about SEO is the fact that it

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,140
is always changing it is always adapting

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,300
it is always moving forward and the the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,579
downside to that is there's so much

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,309
uncertainty on an almost constant basis

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:58,829
but the question this year is I've got a

00:00:50,309 --> 00:01:00,660
clicker that's not working does it seem

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,850
like this year has been even worse than

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,410
usual for updates and changes and and

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,340
just you know oh my god this guy is

00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,380
following kinds of adaptations to SEO

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,660
the reality is that level of change

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,120
presents all kinds of opportunities but

00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,270
it's also pretty intimidating because we

00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,119
have to keep up and I'm going to give

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,670
you the first piece of critical

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,890
information about how to handle SEO in

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,720
2019 this is this is like the first

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,900
tweet bite of the afternoon are you

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,900
ready

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,490
don't let yourself get overwhelmed

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,100
accept the fact that we're now in an era

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,509
where Google is finally walking its talk

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,009
all the things that it's been saying

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,360
it's gonna do and that it values for a

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,630
long time it's finally putting the

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,490
actual systems in place to value those

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,759
things in its search results and we have

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,180
to keep up there is real opportunity it

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,920
is overwhelming so don't think that you

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,920
can take the risk to just turn your back

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,710
and hope that you don't have to pay any

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
attention to it okay we need to hit a

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,580
balance and and I'm serious when I say

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,530
don't freak out

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,150
adaptation is the key to survival both

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,080
for your sanity and for your success

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,150
with SEO it's it's just the way it goes

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,310
so what we want to do today is get a

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,800
really clear understanding of the

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,780
implications of what has changed in the

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,730
last year and then we're going to get a

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,160
rock-solid set of strategies and tactics

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,319
for how to adapt our WordPress websites

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,209
to either mitigate against problems or

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,370
actually take advantage and gain some

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,930
some benefits and some leverage over our

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,320
competition that we're trying to rank

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,730
against if that sounds like a good plan

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,160
we're gonna we're going to hit these as

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,650
the main topics the main areas of SEO

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,690
that have seen really large changes in

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,459
the last year it's it's pretty clear as

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,380
we go through the the presentation there

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,390
will be some fairly text heavy slides I

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,579
wanted to give you some really good

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,720
plans and processes to work with don't

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,769
worry about having to write them down

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,109
there'll be a link at the end of the

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,790
presentation to to grab this online and

00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,200
there's also a page at the end of the

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,600
presentation with all of the links and

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,920
resources typed out there okay so so

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,680
don't worry about trying to grab that

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,209
now there are also some pages that I

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,530
will just reference as being a resource

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,790
for you to look at later I'm not going

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,810
to cover all the information in it I

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,540
just wanted to give it to you as a

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,980
step-by-step resource that said the one

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,230
element of this that I won't cover

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,180
specifically is the major changes to the

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,769
essential tools that's not going to be a

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,630
standalone section I'm going to refer to

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,160
those as we get to each area that we're

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,690
talking about and how the tools that are

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,380
related to that area have been updated

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,150
to to refocus what we're doing okay the

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,069
obvious place to start is with mobile

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,120
for years the search engines you know

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,360
Google and Bing and everybody

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,500
has been telling us that mobile is the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,629
way they want to move towards

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,700
understanding the web this last year

00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,920
since March of 2018

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,980
they finally actually done it they have

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,260
built their system to think like a

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:06,319
mobile user instead of like a desktop

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:08,629
user so starting in 2019 we moved to the

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,819
mobile first index and that's Google

00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,379
saying that Googlebot crawler that that

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,970
piece of software that they send around

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,850
the web to discover your website and

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,389
learn about it it now operates entirely

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,250
as a mobile crawler it's looking at all

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,590
the mobile aspects it's identifying

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,419
itself as a mobile crawler that's the

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,800
way it thinks about the web and that's

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,940
the way it wants to think about the web

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,190
as the search engine understands the

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,260
mobile aspects of your website they're

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,900
even measuring your desktop version

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,910
against that mobile process so your

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,350
desktop version is living or dying by

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,270
how well your mobile version is

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,789
optimized does that make anybody a

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,229
little nervous because it means that we

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,850
don't get to say well you know

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,490
everything looks great on desktop so I'm

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,630
sure mobile is okay because Google's

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,510
gonna say yeah I'm looking at your

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,460
mobile website and know you're I'm just

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,380
not happy here a desktop user may love

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,410
you but a mobile user is not going to be

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,900
happy and there can be lots of reasons

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,760
for it but the key is to identify

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,550
whether you've moved to the mobile first

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,889
index the the the the measurement was is

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,979
your desktop site functionally and

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,200
content essentially identical to your

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,490
mobile site if you are they said fine we

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,870
just move you to a mobile first index

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,160
you should have received an email in

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,530
your Google search console when that

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,210
happened the other easy way to tell for

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,210
sure is you can log in to Google search

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,030
console and request indexing of any page

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,070
you want when that index report comes

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,419
back it'll tell you what user agent

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,560
crawled the page and if it says

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,840
Googlebot smartphone

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,889
welcome to the mobile first index okay

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,810
so that's the way you can tell for sure

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,849
if you're not there now you're on your

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,070
way very soon so start planning and

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,900
getting ready for as of just this week

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,669
Google announced on Tuesday any new

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,800
website created after the 1st of July

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,479
will automatically start by being in the

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,780
mobile first index they will never see

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,009
the the desktop index ok when it comes

00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,749
to the content on mobile

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,289
we start thinking like a mobile visitor

00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:05,479
we have to do all of those things that a

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,129
desktop user doesn't have to worry about

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,240
we've got small viewport we've got a

00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,119
whole lot of scrolling we've got to

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,710
organize all this data start doing that

00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:15,289
from the perspective of a mobile visitor

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,199
first I will give you one caveat if you

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,610
truly do not get a significant

00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,860
percentage of mobile visitors to your

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,449
website you still have to do this

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,309
optimization to make sure the search

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,050
engine is happy with you but it becomes

00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:28,729
less critical for your visitor because

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,080
fewer of them are gonna see it one

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,059
little caveat though I've had lots of

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,129
clients say oh we don't get any visit

00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,449
any mobile visitors to our website yeah

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,960
that's because your mobile version sucks

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,219
rocks when we fix it you suddenly find

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,749
that fifteen or twenty percent more

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,180
people and more page views are coming

00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:45,680
from mobile so don't don't don't turn

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,029
the cart before the horse and say we

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,379
don't need mobile because nobody uses

00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,430
their site on mobile it's maybe the

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,959
reason they're staying away is because

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,490
they can't okay the other big change for

00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,139
a long time anything that was hidden

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,849
from the user on first load of a page

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,159
Google did not give a significant

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:03,529
ranking authority that has changed basic

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,209
accordions basic tabs and things those

00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,399
are essential usability features to make

00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,349
mobile readable google has said we'll

00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,240
start considering that content don't

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,459
hide it behind JavaScript interactions

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,769
CSS and stuff great if you put it behind

00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,169
JavaScript there's a chance Google will

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,309
not process them they will try to and

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,499
you're going to hear this refrain a

00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:22,279
number of times today lots of the stuff

00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,469
I'm talking about

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,519
you will hear Google say do your best

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,899
but you know if you don't want to do

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,519
anything about it we can usually figure

00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,519
it out

00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,110
and don't let Google drag figure it out

00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,149
feed them exactly what you need them to

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,649
have because they will get it wrong at

00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:38,649
least as often as they get it right

00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,080
sorry I'm gonna need you to do it really

00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,080
loud

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,919
yeah that's great as long as the

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,510
Googlebot doesn't have their there the

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,760
Googlebot is trying to run JavaScript

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,050
but if they don't have to run it to see

00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
the content in the first place that's

00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,419
even better

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,430
but we know you know you get one of

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,900
those great big long FAQ pages if you

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,910
don't put those into an accordion or a

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,500
rollup oh my god the person thumb is

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,080
going to get fatigued by the time they

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,070
get finished the the rest of the roll

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,889
I'm just going to give you this one as a

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,419
reference point font size and size of

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,010
icons have to be way bigger than you

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,750
could possibly think that they need to

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,290
be as big as you think they need to be

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,570
double it

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,860
okay that's it's the simple truth

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,960
Google's done the measurement says you

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,350
know how big people's thumbs are 72 by

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,760
72 pixels for a top target okay without

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,200
those you'll get a little warning in

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Google search console it says the

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,500
mobile-friendly content of your page is

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,010
compromised that's probably what's

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,360
happening

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,550
same thing with font size make it good

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,830
and big here a real kicker second layer

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,050
of this process of Google saying we only

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,029
exist on the web now as a mobile as

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,640
assessing the mobile approach starting

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,920
in July last year all speed assessment

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,070
is based on a mobile crawler and a

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,080
mobile view of your pages we have to

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,150
start looking at all of the aspects of

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,190
the speed of our page using mobile based

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,560
tools not using the traditional desktop

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:10,370
tools we have to switch because google

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:11,650
has okay the the same situation still

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,209
holds us what I mentioned last year

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,770
speed is not a massive ranking factor

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,390
you're not going to jump up ten places

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,580
in the search results by making your

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,290
site go from four and a half seconds to

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,450
three and a half seconds when you go

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,400
from twenty seconds to six seconds yeah

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,870
that's going to make a difference but

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,310
don't waste your time nickel and diming

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,720
tenths of seconds if you think you're

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,279
doing it for ranking because it's just

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,709
not gonna it's not gonna have that kind

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,220
of effect but boy how do you do the

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:41,709
users care so the big focus on speed is

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,709
to keep the users happy okay

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,759
this is just going to give you a summary

00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,740
of the the most direct things you can do

00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,439
to a mobile page to get the kind of

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,149
performance Google is going to require a

00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:55,470
lot of these are most easily handled for

00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,750
those of us who aren't developers buy a

00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,550
good solid caching plugin

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,050
they will handle browser caching they

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,550
will handle some minification of some of

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,290
your JavaScript some of the better ones

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,389
will allow you to move your JavaScript

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,670
to the footer of the page or to not even

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,990
load it on the page if your page doesn't

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,209
have a contact form on it

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,829
please please don't load the JavaScript

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,660
for your contact form and waste that

00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,459
extra load time there are a lot of

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,589
elements of your website that you will

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,029
realize plugins are trying to load on

00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,220
every page even though the page isn't

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,649
using them find those and tell the

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,149
system to not load them that you will be

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:32,220
amazed at how much you can speed up some

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:33,689
of your most critical pages the big

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,459
difference and I mentioned this last

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,470
year and it's it's great because you

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,110
know you say something and you're saying

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,060
I don't have Google's proof of this but

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,529
you know every indication I've got says

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,939
this is true and then this year I can

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,720
stand up and say guess what Google just

00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,660
said it's true

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,800
ok Google has changed the focus of what

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,809
they care about for PageSpeed they don't

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,779
care about total load time because they

00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:59,670
know users don't care we as a visitor on

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,139
our phone hitting a web page we don't

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,720
give a rat's tiny honey how long it

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,250
takes for that flutter stuff to load we

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,170
want to know that we can start reading

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,319
the top of the page within a second or

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,809
two

00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:12,329
that's called time to content full first

00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,829
paint it's the time that we start

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,660
getting a signal that this page is going

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,910
to be useful to us and then there are

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,600
some other some other load times that

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,339
become useful to us as well and as I

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,529
mentioned with the tools Google has

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,360
completely re-engineered the PageSpeed

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,069
insights tool its own page measurement

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,050
tool PageSpeed measurement tool to

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:35,490
reflect this change ok so now when you

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,660
look at PageSpeed insights to anybody

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,860
that heard me speak last year the big

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,199
problem with this tool is it didn't

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,029
actually report speed nowhere on the

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,339
page that say how many seconds your page

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,259
load took it does now but look at the

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,910
page speeds that it reports first

00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,199
content fill paint first meaningful

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,389
paint which means that the page is

00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:53,069
starting to become interactive and then

00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,720
you've got some other ones like for CPU

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,069
idle and estimated input latency latency

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,600
if you really want to get geeky dive

00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,910
into those

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,160
and read the definition zone but if

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,350
you've got a page on mobile that is

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,800
becoming content full first paid aware

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,810
in less than two seconds we're good the

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,250
users going to experience that as close

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,200
enough to instantaneous that they're

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,690
gonna be ok when it starts dragging

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,040
beyond three seconds we need to start

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,140
figuring out whether we should simplify

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,400
the page I mean the the the the honest

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,590
truth is we need to start building

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,240
simpler websites for people that are

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,820
trying to read a website on that

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,890
viewport the dancing macaroni just

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,450
doesn't cut it they don't want to be it

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,860
depending on their search depending on

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,360
what the topic is they don't want to be

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,520
entertained they want to be educated

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,350
fast you know get what I need and go

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,750
because particularly on a mobile device

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,980
not only is it small but they're using

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,360
it when they're on the go they're not

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,670
sitting at a desk where they've just

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,710
spent an hour perusing you know YouTube

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,120
videos on instructional stuff they want

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,590
a quick hit of that information as fast

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,100
as they can get it so they can act on it

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,140
and get moving

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,950
that's intent and we're gonna cover that

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,260
in a second ok this top top section here

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,640
if your site gets enough traffic and is

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,010
well-known enough to Google there will

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,720
actually be measurements of Google's

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,250
understanding of the speed of your page

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,110
like it allows you pull from the Google

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,300
Experience Index which comes from their

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,970
browser plugin sorry their their browser

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,310
toolbar most of us are working without

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,880
that information so we're working with

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,360
content we'll paint this information on

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,450
first load is based on a typically 4G

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,730
mobile speed connection it's not using a

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,200
fast database connection so don't be

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,670
freaked out when you've got a much

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,780
slower result here than you're used to

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,040
with the desktop you can actually talk

00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,930
about top left hand corner you can

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,460
toggle between mobile and desktop but do

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,930
be aware that Google is kind of taking a

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,640
worst-case scenario for mobiles

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,130
connection speed and saying we're you

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,480
know we're gonna base it on 1.2 megabits

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,610
per second I think is what they're

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,560
connecting at so if you know that the

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,210
vast majority of your of your customer

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,590
base is working you know in a city like

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,480
Hamilton or Toronto or something like

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,860
that they're probably at LTE speeds

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
we're gonna we're gonna look at a

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,460
different way to test that to get a

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,560
clearer idea rather than Google's worst

00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,780
case scenario dead but know that that's

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,330
gonna freak out at first cuz you man is

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,550
by page slow that's why okay

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,290
the second aspect of this you can get

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,910
those PageSpeed insights measurements

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,810
from inside your own browser the

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,000
developer tools in chrome now in core

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,740
what's called a lighthouse audit and it

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,970
does exactly the same speed measurements

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,440
as you just saw from the PageSpeed

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,240
insights tool okay right click select

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,270
inspect in your browser and you can ask

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,320
for a lighthouse audit it's also going

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,670
to give you some really good stuff

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,170
around SEO it's gonna give you some

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,839
really good stuff around usability and

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,279
even do a really rudimentary

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,930
accessibility audit for you you're gonna

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,339
need to do more than just what Chrome

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,750
will give you for your accessibility

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:41,250
audit but it's a really good starting

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:43,770
point on if like ok you can set that

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,470
test on your own browser to run at your

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,450
native internet connection speed so that

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,730
would test the desktop speed but that's

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,910
not what we're focusing on so you can

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,860
also set it to use the what's called the

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,810
the applied 3G speed which is just like

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,970
a fast 3G so again keep in mind that's

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,860
worst case scenario if that test is

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,750
giving you 3 seconds

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,490
you're probably survivable if you're

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,839
down at 2 seconds with that test oh I

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,630
want to meet the guy who wrote your site

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,160
because that's impressive ok if you want

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,800
to do one-off testing of individual

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,380
pages webpagetest.org for example you

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,180
can set the connection speeds right I

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,830
can I can do my testing from a server in

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,170
Toronto so if my customers are local I'm

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,270
going to test from a local server but I

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,339
can configure the connection speed to

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,960
LTE that's gonna throttle that

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,050
connection to give me speed results as

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,010
if I had been using an LTE phone

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,600
unfortunately it doesn't let us actually

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,920
use a device that is a phone I mean a

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,870
phone is a little bit less powerful to

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,880
process for JavaScript and stuff we

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,710
can't do that with it yet but this will

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,600
give you a really good idea run over a

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,490
couple of tests two or three tests and

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,350
running repeat tests to see how well

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,839
when you're caching is working to see

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,089
how your phone base speed is working one

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,010
page at a time ok so this combined with

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,750
page feeds into PageSpeed insights gives

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,980
you a pretty good you know the bookends

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,660
of best-case scenario worst-case

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,260
scenario and you probably live somewhere

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,030
in the middle this is my favorite way as

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,500
an SEO because I don't want to have to

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,570
go to a completely different testing

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,730
program to be able to test my site in

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,770
mobile this is chrome tools again this

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,630
is chrome developer tools when you get

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,339
into the developer tools section that

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,140
bottom left hand corner you can see the

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,140
two little it's supposed to look like a

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,670
mobile phone overlaid over tablet when

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,470
you click on that you can then select

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,160
what device you want it to pretend to be

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,540
and what

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,010
or connection speed you want to pretend

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,680
to be and then you can browse your

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,750
entire website by clicking anywhere I

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,340
mean you navigate your website just as

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,260
if it was on your phone but it means

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,670
you've got all your tools right you can

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,230
you can use your inspection tools you

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,760
can use you can use all the the dev

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,290
tools that you normally use to look at

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,570
that content that you don't have

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,910
installed on your phone it's not perfect

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,770
it's not flawless but it's a really good

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,600
way to start that process of saying I

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,540
want to pay more attention to the way my

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,310
mobile device or my site renders on

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,080
mobile to the non desktop because by

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,030
default we fire up our browser to check

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,120
out how things are on our website right

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,100
and it defaults to desktop view and we

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,680
all are so programmed to assess our

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,939
websites based on the desktop view as as

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,660
we're talking as you're talking about

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,970
this morning

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,819
correct it you know get the content

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,800
first and then fit the content into the

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,209
presentation on the website well you'll

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,290
suddenly start realizing that a lot of

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,910
that critical content you've got to

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,730
really simplify the layout of the page

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,319
and don't don't fall into the trap of

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,850
saying oh well you know the big fancy

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,100
document dancing macaroni and stuff will

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,530
just hide it on mobile because you know

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,090
what it does it hides it from view but

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,770
it all still has to download through the

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,240
bandwidth in the backend and you're

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,800
gonna load up this great big bulky page

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,970
with a great big slow load time even

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,760
though it's only got three paragraphs of

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,470
content so actually put the content in

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,660
your mobile version that that the site

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,050
needs to have and then re adapt it for

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,120
desktop but this this tool is one of the

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,490
fastest ways to start thinking about

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,320
your website like a mobile user rather

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,120
than constantly switching from phone to

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,290
your screen and phone to your screen and

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,210
back and forth you can do it both in the

00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:02,370
same place lots of talk in the last six

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,900
months or so about voice search I want

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,610
to make really clear the difference

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,470
between voice search and voice results

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,420
because voice search we need to start

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,370
optimizing for in dealing or dealing

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,110
with right now like we need to have been

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,230
doing it for the last six months voice

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,610
what voice results for most of us we

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,600
need to start building a plan let's put

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,370
it that way we need to start planning

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,080
for it but the implementation isn't

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:26,040
likely to need to happen in 2019 for

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,930
most of us so the difference is voice

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,520
search is what we currently do on the

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,720
phone you know you tap the Google

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,930
assistant on your phone and you tap the

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,330
microphone and you dictate you know best

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,049
pizza place in West Dale right that's

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,879
voice sir

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,619
but it still gives you the same

00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,480
traditional results back you get a page

00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,860
of search results that you then scan

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,269
down and you've got you know those top

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,739
three in the local pack at the top and

00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:49,169
then you've got a bunch of links to

00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:50,970
other websites so you're still seeing a

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,440
choice of results and then you make your

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,110
pick of which of those results come from

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,779
there okay that's not what happens with

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,690
things like Alexa and and Google home

00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:03,360
you are asking it a question and it is

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,039
picking one result out of the entire

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,799
Internet to dictate back to you

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,210
it's a very different process we're not

00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:12,090
there yet for most of us with our

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,710
websites we're just not I mean the

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,029
typical you know smaller business

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,850
websites or local websites or blogs

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,889
people aren't using their Alexa devices

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,919
to ask questions that are our types of

00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:24,119
businesses sites would answer yet but

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,460
we're getting there I mean you just

00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,080
watch the the numbers of the devices

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,609
being bought and sold you can really see

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,919
we're getting there

00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:33,299
one thing to really watch out for in

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,580
terms of deciding when you need to move

00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,169
on the implementation the stats that

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,840
they talked about about the amount of

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:42,179
usage that those devices get includes

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,119
the really typical what I call personal

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:48,539
service queries what's the temperature

00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,960
today how long does it take to drive to

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:54,450
Toronto you know all all of those kinds

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,859
of questions that are just informational

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,299
no website needs to answer that question

00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,859
that the same things if you type them

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,239
into a search engine you get the answer

00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,340
as the first result right in the search

00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,720
results page so don't be thrown off by

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,369
oh you know the volume of these queries

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,779
is getting massive yeah but are they

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,320
queries that people would be looking for

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:13,730
my kind of content for probably not yet

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:16,109
how do we optimize for these people use

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,960
conversational question language to ask

00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:21,509
their phone for information so start

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,399
using those same phrases in our content

00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,529
it used to be that we you know we would

00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:27,119
say pizza Westdale right if we were

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,289
typing it into a into a browser we'd

00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,429
said you know pizza Westdale and we

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,499
start looking for all the pizza places

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,059
in West Dale now we actually asked you

00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,769
know where is the best pizza place near

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,659
me

00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,309
there is that's the actual search phrase

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,830
that we now need to optimize for we're

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,470
not optimizing for pizza West Dale we're

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,259
optimizing for where is the best pizza

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,330
near me okay gonna give you some hints

00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,000
as to how to go about doing that how do

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,310
we tell exactly what those phrases are

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,230
we can't yet Google search console isn't

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,460
dividing them out separately boy have I

00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,750
got my fingers crossed they will get

00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
around to doing that but we're just not

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,930
there yet

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,140
so everybody think think good thoughts

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,510
for Google adding that to the process we

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,910
can also help Google understand the

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,350
content for those kinds of questions by

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,060
using the effective headers just you

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,820
know straight HTML composition of your

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,980
page good h1s h2s h3 s organize them as

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,180
sub headers get your schema markup in

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,620
there we're gonna we're going to jump on

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:25,080
that one voice results is a lot of that

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,730
same information as voice questions but

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,710
we're gonna have to be even more careful

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,930
with our schema markup because Google

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,030
needs to really understand the content

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,880
of a page before it can decide to

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,250
dictate it back okay this is why I say

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,630
plan it this year but you're not likely

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,220
to need implementation until next year

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,630
the obvious next step that since we've

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,870
just started talking about you know how

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,190
do you decide what words to use to

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,360
answer those kinds of mobile questions

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,040
is we've got to start getting into a

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,000
conversation about content quality and

00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,710
this the last three updates major

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,170
algorithm updates that Google has made

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,880
have been entirely focused on

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,130
understanding the quality of our

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,420
websites this is really different this

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,740
is the the abilities that they've

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,650
developed because of rankbrain

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,090
and all kinds of machine learning and a

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,230
whole lot of extra capabilities they're

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,020
building into the end of the search

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,460
engine to understand language the way we

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,420
as humans understand it

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,830
okay the downside to this is Google is

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,030
no longer announcing their algorithm

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,750
updates because they know they freaked

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,400
everybody out

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,260
they're only mentioning it if they think

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,300
there's something specific that certain

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,420
site owners might actually be able to do

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,250
about it so an example would be we've

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,410
just released you know the latest

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,170
algorithm update which is designed to

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,790
penalize websites using PB NS private

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,830
blog networks artificial linking

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,510
manipulative linking they're going to

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,070
announce that because somebody could sit

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,750
down and say okay if I do some research

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,340
on my website I can find out that you

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,420
know the last guy that did SEO was using

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,680
some of these but if you lot of looking

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,840
techniques and if I clean them up this

00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,700
problem will go away but the general

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,070
quality stuff they're just saying this

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,900
is us this is what we do now we make our

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,320
search engine assess the quality of

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,320
pages

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,020
don't let yourself go down the rabbit

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,520
holes of really specific individual

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,440
changes because Google keep changing

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,300
keeps changing their mind okay the the

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,430
business with Meta Description length we

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,570
went to 300 we went from 160 to 300

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,270
characters and now we're back to short

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,880
characters again give it give it some

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,520
time if you see a major drop or surge on

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,680
your website give it some time this is

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,250
becoming the common aspect of the

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,920
algorithm so don't you know key word for

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,810
the day don't freak out give it some

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,640
time to see whether it stabilizes the

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,970
other aspect just from this last two

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,590
weeks

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,990
Google's having some real problems with

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,850
their index like they had to freeze

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,130
their index for almost a week because

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,250
somebody broke it on the back end they

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,950
deleted a whole section of the staging

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,570
database they've had problems with

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,760
Google search console so if your if your

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,370
data seems really weird or really

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,960
unusual give it some time before you

00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,450
start making changes because you may

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,830
react you may be reacting to artificial

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:08,710
glitches okay the beauty of this

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,780
question is Google has actually I love

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,970
the expression opened the kimono

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,100
they are publishing their quality raters

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,620
guidelines it's a PDF it's about 100

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,590
pages long and it's their description of

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,200
exactly what they consider to be a top

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,870
quality website okay this is this quote

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,410
is from Ben Gomes it's not the ranking

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,940
process it's what they use to inform how

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,790
the ranking process should deliver

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,890
results so they use it to train actual

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,930
humans who they then assigned to look at

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,670
a whole bunch of websites and then they

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,890
tell the algorithm to assess those

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,750
websites they take the ratings from the

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,250
humans and they compare them and they

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,660
say hey if there's a big discrepancy

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,160
between what our algorithm thought

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,720
algorithm thought of this page and what

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,880
the humans thought about it we need to

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,110
adjust the algorithm either we didn't

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,940
catch a whole bunch of crap that the

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,800
human the human users think is terrible

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,420
or you know we thought this was a

00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,710
terrible page and the human users say no

00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,170
this is exactly answered the question

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,720
that was necessary so I know it sounds

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,810
like the SEO geek coming out in me but

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,160
take a Sunday afternoon and just open

00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,690
that thing up and start reading through

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,370
it I mean it's got it's got amazing

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,220
sections it's got it's got a whole

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,690
section specifically describing what

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,240
constitutes a low quality

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,670
Paige I don't even have to guess anymore

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,230
that's no way it's like that used to be

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,790
the secret sauce of an SEO we'd hit

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,200
enough of these problems just like we

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,240
did enough of these problems that you

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,440
know we could we could interpret and

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,630
interpolate what might be the problem

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,830
now we can just go through the pages at

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,390
all well Google says that you know if

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,130
it's thin content if it's if it's fewer

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,020
than you know 20 or 30 words on a page

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,100
and it seems to open copy from another

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,600
website and it doesn't contribute

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,880
anything material to the knowledge of

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,100
the topic at hand we consider that a

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,120
low-quality page like okay every page on

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,370
my website that meets that description

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,550
I'm now going to go into leak now go

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,550
ahead

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:57,550
sorry aloud her please oh it's the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,750
Google search quality raters guidelines

00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,960
there'll be a link for it at the end of

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,060
the of the presentation so it both shows

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,720
what constitutes a good page and what

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,430
constitutes a bad page we have to start

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,660
being more strict about with what we put

00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,040
on our websites because Google is

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,390
starting to care used to be if it was

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,310
low-quality stuff it just didn't do you

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,020
any good now it's actively working

00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,970
against you it's diluting the quality of

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,620
the page so how do how do we deal with

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,260
updated and improve it if you've got

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,650
content that has been written six months

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,200
ago

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,930
that is about a topical thing that that

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,210
you know still going on go and rewrite

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,980
it add some new resources update the

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,450
images make sure the links all still

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,210
work or find better links to better

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,190
resources do a rewrite of it you can

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,440
even add schema into the back end of it

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,460
to tell Google that it's been updated

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,100
Google will recognize they'll see the

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,440
changes but if it's not good quality

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,690
content you improve it or get rid of it

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,520
and you can get rid of it by either no

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,800
indexing it if it's still useful to a to

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,090
a human user for some reason but the

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,610
search engines shouldn't know about it

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,990
you can no Index it you can redirect it

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,060
although be careful if it's a really

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,650
crappy quality quality you're just

00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,920
redirecting the crappy quality signals

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,240
to a better page or just new cut simply

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,710
delete it and let the search engines

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,060
find a 404 they're gonna say hey this

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,960
wasn't any use to me in the first place

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,300
I don't mind that it's gone the specific

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,880
types of pages to watch for anything

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,650
that has really really small amounts of

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,600
content on the page now this is a

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,350
functional you know navigational page on

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,660
your website fine but if if if you have

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,029
been grabbing in a typical example as

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,159
people grab you know they use if

00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,539
than that to grab tweets and stick

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,369
tweets on a page you know one page at a

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,859
time we had a site that had four

00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:40,769
thousand pages that were one tweet long

00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,690
per page that's just Google doesn't care

00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,700
for that stuff and they're now saying if

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,379
you've got five thousand pages on your

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,889
website in four thousand over this tweet

00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:51,090
crop we're trouble because they're not

00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:52,289
gonna say we'll just ignore the four

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,759
thousand we'll give you credit for the

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,109
thousand good ones they're gonna say no

00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,700
those four thousand crappy ones

00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:59,219
overshadow all the work you did on the

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,989
thousand that are good WordPress

00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,369
specifically has some challenges with

00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,099
this they tend to create duplicate

00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,559
content around things like tags

00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,729
categories and and category archives so

00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,249
date based archives author based

00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,809
archives either beefed up those pages

00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,909
customize them so that they have some

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:17,369
solid introductory content explaining

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,559
what the value of that category is or no

00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:21,359
indexing category pages can be great

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,659
landing pages but you have to customize

00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,429
them tag pages I have found one site in

00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,289
fifteen years of doing WordPress SEO

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,389
that was worth keeping the tag pages

00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,549
indexed so there are a pretty good

00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:34,109
candidate but watch for those kinds of

00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,580
things where it's the same content from

00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,710
somebody else somewhere else on the

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,089
website but formatted differently and

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,950
you know presented in a different order

00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,279
or or organized by author that kind of

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,739
thing

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,690
okay those are created by WordPress by

00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:48,989
default we need to adjust them to get

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,359
rid of them screaming frog really good

00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:54,149
crawling tool Rick talked about it this

00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,659
morning it's my that's my Swiss Army

00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,549
knife

00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,799
the free version will let you work with

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,679
about a hundred pages of a website the

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,969
paid version I will I will argue against

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,429
threats come and say four hundred and

00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:06,869
fifty pounds a year I couldn't do

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,309
without it because it will integrate

00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:10,460
your Google Analytics and Google search

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,779
console results so what I want to know

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,580
pages that the search engine seems to

00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:17,369
think are low quality I can actually ask

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,639
screaming frog just show me the top 50

00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:22,619
pages sorry the the bottom fifty pages

00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:25,379
in terms of pages that haven't received

00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,389
any links or any traffic from the search

00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:29,729
engines in the last six months or nine

00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,929
months and I can look at those pages and

00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,889
say okay well some of them it's because

00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:34,619
they're about Christmas and Christmas

00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:36,179
was a year ago but boy I you know out of

00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,499
those fifty pages I've got 30 pages

00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,839
there that are the reason nobody's

00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,009
visited them is because they're crop and

00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,830
I can do without them

00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:46,200
okay I know none of us have the luck

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,390
of having all the time in the world to

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,220
do what we want to do for SEO so this

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,810
kind of process can let you pick the 50

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,750
things to focus on instead of the 500

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,100
things they won't have time for how do

00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,870
we actually improve the content of the

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,570
pages okay this this is where we get

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,860
going the intent of the content is way

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,230
more important to Google now than it

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,730
ever used to be are they just looking

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,900
for general information to you know to

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,210
study a topic to get more information

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,030
about a topic are they researching a

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,590
product to get ready to buy it are they

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,350
looking for a site to buy what they

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:20,460
already know they want or in the case of

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,370
of investigate uh sort of yeah sorry

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,120
transactional is there ready to buy

00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,590
investigational is there doing the

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,270
research to find out what product they

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,520
might want but they're not buying yet

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,650
and the results the way you target those

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,930
things would be very different so for

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,760
example if somebody's looking for the

00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:38,340
best compact camera that's their search

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,080
term Google's not going to give them a

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,140
page of product results there will be

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,210
probably a carousel at the top of

00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,440
products but the blog page is you know

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,270
the pages that it's going to return are

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,400
going to be review sites they're going

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,680
to be opinion sites that's the content

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,420
you need to write to go after the intent

00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,340
of that keyword if you think you're

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,950
gonna win by getting two or three pages

00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,090
of your of your phone products listed as

00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,310
a result of that search you've

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,960
mismatched the intent and Google's going

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:08,900
to ignore you okay we need to change the

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,340
way we approach content research and

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,260
this is really hard this is this is a

00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,940
tough a thing to change as the switch

00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,130
that we have to make for you know going

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,380
from mobile going from typically

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:23,570
thinking of our desktops our websites

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,570
from desktop to going to mobile okay

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,320
we're not working with individual

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:31,710
keywords Google has figured out that we

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,720
that a way to understand beyond just

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,600
sticking keywords in the right places at

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,670
the right time okay over a third of

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,980
google queries in any one day are more

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:45,300
than four words long so people aren't

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,430
searching for you know a digital camera

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,490
they're searching for best digital

00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:53,780
camera for kids right that's the way we

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,780
need to start thinking about our content

00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,870
it's no longer working if we just want

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,940
to get you know if we think of our

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,500
webpage as a jigsaw puzzle and if we

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,480
just put the right words in the right

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,650
slots on the page the whole thing will

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,540
come together and give us rankings

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,460
because that's not Google's intent

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,440
anymore they've moved way beyond that

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,090
and put a lot of time money and

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,980
engineering resources into getting a

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,290
holistic human understanding of the

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,940
content so instead we need to be propped

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:25,830
amaizing and building content for

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:28,020
concepts ok topics ideas problems you

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,580
know what we're solving that's the

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,760
content that Google now considers high

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,330
quality and it values ok it's the this

00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,340
is this is the idea that the simple

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,080
keyword is now expanding Google wants to

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,360
know about its synonyms if you're

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,220
writing a page Google now has a

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,200
pre-existing set of conditions that it

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,810
thinks are already related to that topic

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,850
and it expects you to include them and

00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,440
if you don't your page can't score as

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,020
well this is called semantically related

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,970
terms a really easy example if I've got

00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,980
two pages and in my mind I'm thinking

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,150
you know both pages target the word

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:08,160
Apple if this page also includes the

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:11,490
words cinnamon crust oven and 350

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:18,060
degrees and this page includes Steve

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:20,100
Jobs iOS share price and and phone it's

00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,660
the same word but it's the the

00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,600
semantically related terms give a

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,680
completely different meaning to the page

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,940
that's tough for us because you know we

00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,150
got to start figuring out what are all

00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,440
those what are all those terms that are

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,030
related to what I'm trying to talk about

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,150
and how do I know which ones to include

00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:38,130
all right that's that's that's the level

00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,630
that's the way to move to the next level

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,700
is let's talk about some tools some

00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,230
specific ways of doing that first let's

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,230
let the SERPs answer your question sir

00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,820
possess ERP search engine results page

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,160
Google is now putting a whole bunch of

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,410
stuff on those search results pages to

00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,510
tell us what it thinks is connected to

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,650
the topic we're researching they're

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,690
doing the work for us and they're

00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,460
actually reporting it okay so this is

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,140
this is just a autocomplete if you start

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,940
typing in your search and stop partway

00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,110
through it'll try and guess what you're

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,160
asking for and it'll tell you a whole

00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,940
bunch of stuff that it thinks might

00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,589
answer your question

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,349
we've got the same thing with people

00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,819
also ask sections okay and if you click

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:15,909
on the people also ask it actually

00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:18,139
expands to give you six more results

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,369
same thing with the people also search

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:25,099
for the section at the bottom of the

00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:26,480
page the great thing is we can now grab

00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:28,970
a tool to do most of the work for

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,649
gathering this stuff for us we can if we

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,929
install this keywords X everywhere

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,819
search extension every time you do a

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,859
search on a SERP on a search results

00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:38,720
page it'll stick this little sidebar box

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,639
in there and it'll amalgamate and total

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,589
up all of the information from those

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,079
separate components of the page and let

00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:46,759
you export it as a CSV that's google

00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,480
telling you these are the semantically

00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:52,159
related terms to what you just asked for

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,869
you can do the the same sort of process

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,970
in google search console the new search

00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:58,640
console will let you ask to show you a

00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:00,680
page on your website and then list all

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,569
of the search terms that people have

00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,549
actually been exposed to that page for

00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:05,779
you will find some real gems in there

00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:07,220
that will really surprise you you'll

00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:09,559
you'll see words that you didn't think

00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,759
we're related but suddenly they are so

00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,599
in this case I'm not sure how clearly

00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:16,759
you can see it this is a best marathon's

00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,500
to quaff s traces to qualify for Boston

00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:20,059
Marathon and there you know there's the

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,180
typical ones in best marathon quality

00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:25,519
foreign race blah blah blah so the first

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,259
one actually includes the year oh gee I

00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,670
guess if I want to be relevant if I'm

00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,809
you know this is this is obviously

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,099
something that changes from year to year

00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,349
Google's going to expect me to be up to

00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,299
date this one blew me away I had no idea

00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:38,210
that racers referred to the Boston

00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:41,450
Marathon as BM there's four hundred and

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:44,720
thirty five searches a month using that

00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,670
short form we already had a really good

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,410
well ranking page for this content but

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,150
when I went back to the to the content

00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,680
folks on the website and said please you

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,390
know a couple of times on the page where

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,390
you've heard of the Boston Marathon just

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,309
shorten it to BM because Google now

00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,660
understands that that phrase is directly

00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:02,690
related to what I'm looking for

00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,309
we've also got things like the fastest

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,910
marathon courses it doesn't even mention

00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:10,970
Boston but Google has figured out that

00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,230
somebody wants to qualify for Boston the

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,180
easiest way to do it is to run a

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,099
marathon that is already typically fast

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,319
in the first place right and then the

00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:21,170
last one is is just location qualifying

00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,910
times or sorry

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,460
I can't even read it myself just boss

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,930
Boston qualifying times so Google's

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,309
actually expecting you to list what the

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,250
what the times are for this year's race

00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,740
okay answer the public another superb

00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,170
tool you and you enter a topic it will

00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,700
generate all of the questions related to

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,279
that topic in all kinds of different

00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,930
ways the who what where when why how it

00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:44,240
will pull all of that information from

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,950
Google's automatic index and bings

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,410
automatic index and give you a list of

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,730
those answers ok that's going to give

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,829
you an idea of how you can use some of

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,410
those kinds of questions so this is us

00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:56,029
finding out the longer phrases and

00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,549
related terms that people actually use

00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,660
to ask for what they're going for

00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,220
remember I said the tools are adopting

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,170
Yoast has just put a whole lot of work

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,359
into their SEO tool particularly the pro

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,940
tool now understands and recommends

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,099
semantically related terms even the

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,619
basic version will now take into account

00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:14,059
synonyms instead of you know giving you

00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:15,079
a fail on the content of your page

00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,730
because it says it doesn't include

00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,500
enough of the of the keyword that's

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,750
gonna recognize that synonyms count as

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,980
the key word okay so we're getting it

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,420
much more towards what the search

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,940
engines think rather than hitting all

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,099
those all those green green lights a

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,799
site architecture is really tough the

00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:32,569
more complex our websites get the harder

00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:34,549
time Google has understanding how our

00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,890
pages relate to each other so we have to

00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:38,299
give it as much help as possible ok we

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,490
need we need to make clear the

00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:42,589
relationships between pages the easiest

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:44,359
way to do that is with the original site

00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:46,250
architecture so in this case typical

00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,109
WordPress setup is just slash post name

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,430
that's a completely flat architecture

00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:52,160
there's no implied relationship between

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,019
pages if we can get subtopics and sub

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,029
subtopics into the into the structure of

00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,910
the directories of the page Google

00:37:56,029 --> 00:38:00,920
starts to understand a little bit better

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,660
the absolute gold standard is just

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,460
internal internal linking how you link

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,079
from one page to the next tells Google

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,599
which pages you think are related to

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,220
each other that's probably the weakest

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,250
and easiest to fix component of

00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,170
anybody's website start thinking of what

00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,390
the excuse me of what the primary page

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,119
is what the most authoritative you know

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,380
broadest page is and really optimize it

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,970
and you know consider making it a page

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,859
instead of a post but then you rent when

00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,990
you write blog posts that are about that

00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,339
topic link them to that primary page

00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,349
you've heard it called cornerstone

00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,180
content or pillar content right let the

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,369
internal linking show the search engines

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,680
how all of these pages that are you know

00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,930
about

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,120
similar topic all linked to this one

00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,560
primary page okay well this primary page

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,420
becomes the one to rank for the hardest

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,920
search terms and all of these guys get

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,920
to rank for their longer simpler terms

00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,910
we got to make sure that the search

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,930
engines can find our stuff okay they

00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,520
have to be able to get through the

00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,870
website the crawler will only work so

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,170
hard and then it will just go somewhere

00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,760
else and the way this works is what

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,620
happens is the crawler traverses the

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,120
page and just discovered traverses the

00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,290
website and follows all the links and

00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,480
follows your sitemap and tries to

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,730
discover all of your pages but at that

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,860
point all it says is I know this page

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,270
exists I don't know anything about it I

00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,850
haven't assessed that it's quality or

00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,980
not I just know it exists the next level

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,600
as it has time is it will process the

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,240
pages and it will develop them for the

00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,190
index and that's deciding is this thing

00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,380
valuable enough to actually put it into

00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,300
the search index and then the last stage

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,880
that happens just as somebody types in

00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,430
their request is it will compare a whole

00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,500
bunch of possible index pages for the

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,200
best result and it'll return that as the

00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,730
ranking okay so what we want to do is

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,980
use the new Google search console

00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,520
coverage report because it actually has

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,850
a report called discovered but not

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,020
indexed we never had that before this is

00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,640
I mean those of you who heard me speak

00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,050
last year I said you know but the new

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,220
version of Google search console just

00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,320
isn't there yet so we're going to keep

00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,620
focusing on the old version yeah not

00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,060
anymore

00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,890
everything's gone from the old version

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,380
so we're now in the new one okay this is

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,730
Google's tool forcing us in the

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,760
direction that they want us to consider

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,490
important this is this is the the report

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,610
I've got fifty thousand pages on this

00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:13,140
site that are marked as excluded and all

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,940
down this section it's giving give me

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,700
all the reasons why some of those pages

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,620
aren't there everything from submitted

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,210
URL is marked no Index well that might

00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,740
be a good thing that's probably the

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,910
pages that I did that to on purpose but

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,470
I'm gonna review it and make sure I

00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,320
didn't goof and block some stuff

00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,090
accidentally submitted URL has crawl

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,380
issues I'm gonna get in and see what it

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,640
tells me about what the crawlers shoes

00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,400
for and see if I can fix them but the

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,600
one in particular I'm looking at here is

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,820
excluded by no index okay we know that

00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,680
might be good news discovered but

00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,520
currently not indexed seven thousand six

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,290
hundred pages

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,700
I'm gonna start looking at those some of

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,760
them it may be perfectly legit I'm gonna

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,710
look at them go yeah

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,330
you know my privacy polity policy page

00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,710
I'm not surprised that's not indexing

00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,420
I'm not gonna worry about that but

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,160
you'll start discovering patterns to

00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,390
these pages that Google saying hey I

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,850
know all about this thing and I don't

00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,440
think it's worth putting in the index

00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,910
okay then I'm gonna start diving into

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,500
all of those other quality methods that

00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,760
we talked about and figure out how to

00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,290
turn that into something that the Google

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,960
cares about enough to index and once

00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,070
I've made those changes each page as I

00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,630
click on them there's actually little

00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,120
button that says resubmit to the index

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,780
which is asking Google to reconsider the

00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,920
fact that they've excluded it okay

00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,090
another element here I'm gonna I'm going

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,700
to move through these quickly because

00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:24,760
the slides are fairly self-explanatory

00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,890
schema markup is you using data and code

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,870
to explain to the search engines exactly

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,660
what a piece of data means so if the

00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:34,810
search engine sees that number it's got

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,690
no idea what that number refers to but

00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:40,330
as soon as you mark it up with schema Oh

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,560
phone number okay we can do the same

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,970
thing with all kinds of different

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,330
content we can do it with events

00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:50,680
products recipes just in the last six

00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:52,780
months fa Q's and how-to pages you want

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,640
to get those voice search results have

00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,080
the markup on your page that says this

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,630
is a page that answers this question

00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,340
here is the question here is the answer

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,690
like you can't get any more clear

00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,900
instructions to the search engine than

00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,820
that okay you can also mark up the

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,350
different architectural aspects of your

00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,030
page you can mark up your breadcrumbs so

00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,740
Search Search knows how to use those in

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,330
search results you can also mark

00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,160
yourself up as a person as an

00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,260
organization or as a local business and

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,520
those are really critical for the search

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,210
engine understanding how to how to

00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,070
credit you

00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,050
there's the structured data testing tool

00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,400
once you get it configured a lot of this

00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,050
you can pull from plugins the better

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,190
plugins for you know advanced or

00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,530
products or whatever they will include

00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,120
the markup the better SEO plugins are

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,280
starting to incorporate a lot of that

00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,570
that markup in them as well this is

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,120
Google's own tool there's a link at the

00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:39,520
end of the of the of the thing to show

00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,990
you how to test and this is what it does

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,520
it actually gives you a readout and if

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,660
you click on any of the right-hand side

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,130
there where there's a warning and an

00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,600
error it'll highlight the code that it

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,300
doesn't consider correct like it really

00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,500
helps the process this report is also

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,600
available in your new Google search

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,580
console it'll tell you pages that it

00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,680
thinks has problems with your schema

00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,150
that's what you get as a result of

00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,320
having schema this is a project that

00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,880
I've been working on it

00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,600
it's great it's a really good example of

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,660
what happens so there's a rating schema

00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,110
and that's in addition because there's a

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,910
vent schema on the page okay there's a

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,160
page that only has products scheme or

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,810
rating schema and look at the one in

00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,240
between that doesn't have any schema at

00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,450
all they all have the same markup on the

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,670
page because I built it we can't count

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,320
on Google honoring our requests to get

00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,910
those reach snippets we can give it the

00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,320
best information we can and cross our

00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,610
fingers and hope for the best and it

00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,520
will develop over time this is a very

00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,130
recent project local search optimization

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,980
has really shifted because Google wants

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,750
to be your homepage or your catalog if

00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,760
you're a local business Google is saying

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,560
if you type in the the topic of the

00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,610
business or you look for that topic in a

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,730
map or you hit excuse me you hit the the

00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,170
search result itself they want you know

00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,710
if you're looking for the phone number

00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:58,030
to to book that haircut they want to

00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,530
show you the result on their page and

00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,460
keep you there until you find the phone

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,570
number and then you click the phone

00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,550
number and you get to the hair salon

00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,750
they don't want to send you to the Hair

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,270
Salons website and then the hair salon

00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,980
lists the phone number and go we have to

00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,150
be aware of that we may not like it but

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,760
we have to fight that battle

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:15,010
this is especially applicable on mobile

00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,960
because it's location dependent if

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,340
you're looking for a pizza place the

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,600
search engine is going to recognize I'm

00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,250
in West Dale and that's gonna give me

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,930
recommendations close to me I'm gonna

00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,030
have a really hard time competing from

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,380
the East End of Hamilton if somebody's

00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,030
standing outside the front door on

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:33,370
Longwood Road saying that's good best

00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:35,470
pizza yeah that's right so this is what

00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:38,110
it's gonna look like when you do a

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,550
search you'll get that 3-pack at the top

00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,470
either on your phone or on desktop and

00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,450
when you click on one of the elements in

00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,090
that in that 3-pack this is the stuff

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,130
that comes up but in the last six months

00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:51,460
Google's given us a raft of really

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,810
useful new stuff and the expression I

00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,150
use this don't bring a knife to a

00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,800
gunfight if that content is all

00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,050
available there your content your

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,640
competitors are gonna use it somebody's

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,200
gonna out optimize you if you don't do

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,440
the work yourself and you can't afford

00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,850
to give them that bad advantage so this

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,870
gives you some point forms of some of

00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,480
the stuff that you need to get set up

00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:12,670
and there a lot of that information is

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,200
coming from

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,260
so if you look here you've got things

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,609
like address reservation addresses phone

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,890
number there's a whole lot of

00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:23,760
information on there it's all coming

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:26,559
from your Google my business profile and

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,420
in addition the schema markup that you

00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,720
put on the page that local business

00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:35,109
schema okay you can now put your own

00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:38,710
posts on that on that page I think that

00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:40,720
the site that I gave the example yeah

00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,769
they have a post from Aberdeen tavern

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,599
they have from Aberdeen tavern a

00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:45,099
big-city dining spinners you can publish

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,260
a post and it will show up right there

00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,519
in the search engine results you can't

00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,829
pass that up you can make it an event

00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,450
you can you can list a product in there

00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,250
really get creative and think about how

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,779
you can use those we've had really good

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,369
luck making the photo that goes with a

00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:59,680
post look like a call to action button

00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:01,390
don't make it an illustration like make

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,359
it a solid background with the arrow and

00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,519
the click here for today's special it's

00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,049
not a pretty photo but the user doesn't

00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:15,490
care they they react to it as a call to

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:17,619
action button when you when you click on

00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,720
that result in the search results page

00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:21,430
it's going to show you this now there is

00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,750
a link at the top there for the website

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:29,230
if you click that it'll send you out to

00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:30,250
the website if they don't need to go to

00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,539
the website if they're just looking for

00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,890
the phone number they could click on the

00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,450
phone and it'll dial or their mobile

00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:41,470
phone and they'll get to call for a

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:43,690
reservation sorry I can't hear ya the

00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,160
for a restaurant that's true there are

00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,660
certain kinds of queries that we would

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,130
much rather have the visitor get to our

00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,049
website so that we can do a better job

00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,640
with selling them the end result but a

00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:53,410
restaurant is a perfect example where

00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,970
most people will get what they need from

00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,059
the from the the GMB

00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,380
results service area businesses have

00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:01,240
changed if you're you know a plenty

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,779
somebody whose services people away from

00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:07,059
your local your local residence or

00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:08,980
address make sure you go in and adjust

00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:10,450
it it's now it's now a different process

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,460
than the old circle used to be actually

00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:17,200
have to list it by area code or by

00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:20,049
postal code getting that schema on your

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,250
website one of the sneaky things you can

00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:23,140
do you can add your own questions and

00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,119
answers you can put your own question in

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,410
and then answer it yourself so do the

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,210
most important things related

00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,680
your website and then the sneaky part is

00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,630
get your friends to go in and up vote

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,180
that question okay

00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,589
new citations building content with

00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,240
local intent if you're not going to be

00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:38,410
blogging do a couple of case studies for

00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,349
each of the neighborhoods where you do

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,030
your work okay I'm gonna run through

00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:44,410
this really quickly because it's a

00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,270
resource for you when you when you look

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,859
at the result of offline at the end

00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,720
because this is just a summary an action

00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:52,329
plan of what we've been talking about so

00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,069
for mobile switch to those new tools get

00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:56,859
your content based on what a usable

00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:58,660
version for a mobile visitor will be get

00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:01,329
that content full first paint down to

00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:03,280
two seconds when we get to voice search

00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,470
go for those start using those longer

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,930
more conversational questions as the

00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,880
leading point of the content that you're

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,400
writing and get schema and page headings

00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,539
on their content quality this is the

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,579
stuff that we spend a fair bit of time

00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:18,130
on read the search quality raters

00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:20,530
guidelines like my god there's no better

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,970
Bible for us as website owners to

00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:26,349
understand what Google is going to

00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:28,839
reward on our web sites create a process

00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:30,910
so that you have a way of getting the

00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,190
new the the old content updated and

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,299
upgraded don't just oh it's been a year

00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,440
and I just thought maybe I'll you know

00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:36,609
spend a Friday afternoon going through

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,069
it put something in the calendar to make

00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:40,599
it a process get that content matching

00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:41,680
the intent look at the search result for

00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,569
the question that you're trying to

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,390
optimize for and see what kind of pages

00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:48,520
come back and shift about that new

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,190
research process of using concepts and

00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,299
topics rather than individual keywords

00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:56,619
site architecture we covered pretty

00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:58,180
clearly schema we just covered okay get

00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:59,650
that cart get the configuration for as

00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,750
many of those elements as apply to your

00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,700
content as possible and watch for the

00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,619
new stuff coming out there is voice

00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,240
search schema it's only used for news

00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:09,549
websites at this point so don't pay any

00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,130
attention to okay and then local search

00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:13,720
get into your Google my business console

00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,859
and start looking at all of the things

00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,180
that are there and figuring out how to

00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:20,920
use them just on Tuesday mobile search

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,260
results you now have your little website

00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,390
favicon five icons showing beside your

00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,799
website name if you don't have one for

00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,930
your website you get this boring little

00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:31,299
generic thing from Google that won't

00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,559
arrest people's attention so simple

00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:33,700
little thing if you don't have one get

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,250
it configured and get it installed on

00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,410
your site there's the link to the

00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,150
resources page okay so you'll have you

00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,460
can quickly get to all of the stuff

00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,260
and that's the link to the page itself

00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,550
that is loaded up on SlideShare and it's

00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,840
ready to go for you so all of that

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,220
information is there so that you can

00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,500
copy and paste and read it quickly

00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,680
instead of having to take it off of a

00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,750
photo on the phone okay I'm gonna say

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,580
again don't freak out know that these

00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,200
changes are going to continue and

00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,780
they're going to they're going to speed

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,190
up and the best way to deal with them is

00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,900
to know that they present opportunities

00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,250
and you're going to need to cherry-pick

00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,560
the things you have the resources to

00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,270
address but as long as you work to that

00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,920
plan and pick the areas that you're

00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,870
going to optimize in each section of

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,610
your month you can make some really good

00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,260
progress and you can start getting ahead

00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,180
of the folks who are like that little

00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,770
kid on the swing with with his world

00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,570
going going up in flames behind him

00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,890
that's that's the majority of website

00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,750
owners they're just hoping they can

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,030
ignore it and keep swinging their swing

00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,500
but it's the folks that are that are you

00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,840
know diving into the frustration and the

00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,210
uncertainty and saying okay we can we

00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,560
can work with this it's gonna be a

00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,120
little scary it's going to be

00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,440
uncomfortable but it is working with

00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,820
because the great thing is if it goes

00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,350
wrong you just undo it and do something

00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,230
else I mean you try not to do that too

00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:47,560
often but you really have to overcome

00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:49,600
that idea now that a page is done when

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,220
you publish it because six months from

00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,420
now you're gonna have to go back and do

00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,040
a bunch of new stuff to it because

00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,920
Google has readapted how they're going

00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:00,490
to assess it okay so don't freak out

00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,020
stay patient don't overreact but build a

00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,150
plan for the things that you do have the

00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,220
resources to tackle and go after them

00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:09,360
that's how you'll get to success on on

00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,360
the on SEO in 2019
