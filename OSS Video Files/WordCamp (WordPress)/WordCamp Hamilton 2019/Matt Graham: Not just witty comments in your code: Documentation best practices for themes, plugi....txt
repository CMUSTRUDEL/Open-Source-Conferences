Description: 
	As a developer in the WordPress ecosystem, you’re part of a large open source community; and being part of a community, being a good neighbour goes a long way. You’re thinking of or already developing components for WordPress, but developing is just the beginning: allowing your code to be used or modified easily will get you more goodwill within the community. That means documentation; meaning useful code comments, user manuals and API docs.
We’ll discuss documentation standards, best practices, and how to make your users and other developers sing your praises.

	00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,630
yeah so to extend that you know talking

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,109
about documentation so you've all read

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,990
the the comic yeah not just reading

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,789
poems in your code anyway so so let's

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,699
take this makes a distinction between

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,619
documentation versus comments so

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,840
comments obviously comments in your

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,300
codes they started turning and talking

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,250
about dock blocks or just quick little

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,489
snippets to say what's what's happening

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,530
so you know you're helping guide to any

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,290
other developer especially in in that

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,559
collaborative space like like the

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,030
WordPress open source community you

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,370
don't want to be the only one working on

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,920
it like that's the the point of open

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,989
source is to say okay I've come up with

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,320
this idea this is the code that I've

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:04,290
built around it who wants to hold but it

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,909
also helps good good comments can help

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,729
you build your developer documentation

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:14,159
or as documentation it can help the end

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,650
user so that could be a developer but

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,409
it's usually geared more toward the

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,689
person it's not in WordPress parlance

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,119
installing a theme installing the the

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,259
plug-in and giving them step-by-step

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,790
instructions on you know any stuff

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,850
that's outside of the box of what

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:38,030
WordPress would do so yeah code comments

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,030
ooh

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:49,400
so so why would you wanted to comment I

00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,940
mean I've got my point I I'm fully open

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:58,070
to any of you you know chiming in so

00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:00,979
like why would you want to put into your

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,420
code well you know you want like I said

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:07,190
earlier you want other people to help

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:10,340
you out with your code and you know not

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,530
everyone writes obvious code but you

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,860
know that's the goal but that's not

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,180
always the case so that's for you to

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,310
understand your code because if you

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,990
wrote it and then six months later you

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:27,320
have to go back to it well you know what

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:30,020
I mean I've looked at some of my code

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:35,420
from eight months ago and go what the

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,310
heck was I thinking like really yeah

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,910
again going back to the ease of creating

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,200
coreference

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,180
I'll touch on that a little bit later

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,330
but no but yeah who's heard of PHP

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,920
documenter

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:55,010
anybody know PHP documenter so it's it's

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,790
basically it's a it's a framework that

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,310
you essentially feed at your code and as

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,650
long as you have good doc blocks and

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,260
good commenting within your code it will

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:11,930
actually create a reference a code

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:16,640
reference for you so think about the

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,739
WooCommerce API documentation it's I I

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,060
don't know that they use PHP documenter

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,220
but I'm pretty sure they used an

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,620
automated tool and then filled in the

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:32,950
blanks that the comments didn't didn't

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:36,260
put in there what you yeah anytime

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,150
usually once it's done like that you

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,040
basically do it once your release is

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:45,019
ready and then it spits out HTML because

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,239
it's like a process it's not something

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,590
that that gets like it's not something

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,020
that's dynamic it's something that's

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,810
static it's created and you dump it

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,170
and you know on your on your server or

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,660
on s3 bucket or something like that but

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,790
it's essentially all linked and you know

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,920
shows all the different classes show how

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,310
they enter relate as long as you've done

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:14,510
that documentation process in like the

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:17,420
the dock blocks yeah and to-do lists for

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,640
yourself so if there's a there's a

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,000
feature that you want to integrate but

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,280
it's not critical you can put that in or

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,760
even if it's as you're going and you say

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,350
oh I need to parse this string too into

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,780
an array it's a bad example but but you

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,350
put it out to do and it'll actually put

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,420
it in a lot of I des will actually call

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,940
it out for you well either highlight it

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,700
or will actually put it as like an

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,440
almost like an error or warning saying

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,240
you need to look at that later or

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,390
whenever you open the files like oh hey

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,520
look at that and as I said before being

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,990
a good open-source citizen if you want

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,570
people to use your code if you want

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,980
people to collaborate on your code

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,080
comments are gonna help people get into

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,610
it a whole lot easier and usually when

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,890
it comes to open source people are doing

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,420
it because they like it and if you're

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:12,010
making it difficult for them to do that

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,010
don't just go onto a different project

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,650
when so some are on the fence of the

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,920
usefulness of code and a lot of a lot of

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:24,050
this is more on the compiled languages

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,530
side of things so you're talking like a

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,750
C and its iterations Java that sort of

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,070
thing because it does it doesn't do

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,800
anything for the compiler it's

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,180
essentially writing code twice because

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,370
you're writing it for the compiler and

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,050
you're writing it for the human looking

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:44,030
at it later you know and in the case of

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,070
JavaScript and CSS if you put a lot of

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,650
comments and it's going to take up

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,200
bandwidth when someone downloads it

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,180
they're downloading everything including

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,300
those comments unless you mean I find

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,050
which is obviously a good idea but

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:03,390
that's another discussion

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:05,920
um yeah I think always Lyc

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:10,350
yeah it might be an unpopular opinion

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,220
but comments are critical to your

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,930
understanding other people's

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:20,560
understanding it's it's the pros

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:26,580
outweigh the cons every time to me again

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,580
it might be an unpopular opinion sure

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,570
yeah III am gonna touch on that yeah but

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,800
you know what it's a discussion because

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:48,340
we're a small group here it's all good

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:52,360
my so the the point that I made a

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:56,680
caramel which sigh it's on but yes you

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,140
should aim to right excellent code to

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,600
things that don't cover that don't get

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,790
covered there is if you want to get to a

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,330
point where you're creating automated

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,990
documentation that won't help you you'll

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:14,169
get like if if it's a I haven't used PHP

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,270
documenter in a couple years but what it

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,150
spits out is it looks at your comments

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,990
first and then it looks at the method or

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,060
function so if there's no comment then

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,430
it'll just give you the the function and

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,830
you know what variables it expects but

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,520
if you're not explicit about what your

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:41,320
function or method expects it doesn't

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:46,000
know it says so like create array you

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:48,669
know say data one instead of data one

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,410
being a string it's expecting a string

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:58,150
it'll just say mixed so even though your

00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:01,470
function would treat that as a string if

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,510
someone passes an array it'll blow up

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,650
right and I mean it's it's not at the

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,560
end of the day it's not a big deal

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,969
because we're not you know as WordPress

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,839
developers we're not dealing with

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:18,849
like high scale high volatility data but

00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,939
it's a good idea to be a little bit more

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,979
strict with yourself because again it

00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:26,379
helps people understand your code

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:29,649
because it may it may be completely

00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:32,079
obvious to you but it might not be to

00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:35,110
someone else even with good variable

00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:37,750
names and you know well-structured code

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,649
and all that your understanding might be

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,990
different from someone else's

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,990
understanding but

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,280
I was gonna post a meme there but it had

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,470
intellectual property so I made my own

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,960
so yeah we're so your code should be

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,250
self-explanatory exactly what may be

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,840
clear to you may not be clear to others

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,880
yeah so use comments as it means briefly

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,760
explain the file the class or function

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,520
using a dog walk again because of the

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,550
documentation tools that are out there

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,470
and a code block using uh or a comment

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,460
block is what I meant to put there no a

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,820
code block no it's okay if I commented

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,970
my own slides I wouldn't understand

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,560
anyway so yeah if you're if you're

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,570
wanting to just do like a code block

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,930
that's within a function or something

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,700
like that

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,130
Benny Keane is just a simple comment

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,200
some people will actually go to lengths

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,050
of actually creating a small doc block I

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:43,510
don't do that but your mileage may vary

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:50,290
oh yes this is another reason for Italy

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:53,340
good it's funny I'll let you all read

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,340
that first it's funny

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:03,210
stop judging me so yeah simple comments

00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,420
I'm sure all of you know what comments

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:09,720
look doc blog is more the interesting

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,410
stuff so this is a huge P doc so this

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,340
specific doc blog is for a method within

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:38,400
a class it's super super simple

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:41,100
but you kind of get the idea so the name

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:50,910
of it an explanation of what's what that

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:53,130
data should be but you know what the

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,070
what the function return or method

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,860
returns an explanation of it you don't

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,790
necessarily need to do a description but

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,380
that's one of the things that's

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,850
recommended especially around the duck

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,850
you look like you have a question

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,660
some will pretty sure eclipse does if

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,650
you're that nerdy I can be done at times

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,570
but I use PHP storm which actually

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:29,040
generates them properly and there are

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:32,430
plugins that will read it but at the end

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,170
of the day that this is for the two

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,870
things other people reading your code

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,870
and the automated documentation tools

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:57,810
I think yeah you don't read it no that's

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,420
right yeah I agree with you there but if

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,810
you want to bring someone else into into

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,820
the fold then it helps them cuz it's

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,890
like oh I don't have to read through the

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,890
code I just go oh that's what it does

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,840
okay oh I need to fix something that

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:17,870
it's doing yeah okay it looks like it's

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,870
their kind of thing no go for it

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,590
[Music]

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,440
like how long like you know your

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,060
lifetimes a long time a lot of things

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,339
can happen you don't really know like oh

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,589
yeah and I mean that I've been kind of

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,240
going more along the lines of you know

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,980
if you're a plug-in or a theme developer

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,490
but if you're doing something for a

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,110
client and you know the thing that they

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,819
always say is if you get hit by a bus

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,639
what happens not that I would wish that

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:27,410
on anyone but I mean even if it's

00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,550
something as simple as you move halfway

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,779
around the world and you no longer can

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,959
deal with that client so they have to go

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:38,750
find someone else you've done it so you

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,759
say let's say you've built a theme from

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,949
scratch and a couple plugins from

00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,730
scratch for their site because nothing

00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:49,430
else fits or doesn't fit enough okay

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:53,420
it's great you're an awesome developer

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,670
did you comment your code if someone

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:59,660
else has to take over what are they

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:07,579
getting into again you can create code

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:09,170
that is very self-explanatory to you but

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:12,529
that doesn't mean that everyone can read

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,300
your code and at the end of the day yes

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:18,430
they they will be able to read it

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,680
because you know there are a plethora of

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:26,269
PHP functions and WordPress functions

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:30,260
and JavaScript functions that are well

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:33,019
documented everywhere else but then

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,300
you're creating more work for that new

00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,160
developer to go and figure out if they

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:43,630
haven't used it to go and figure out

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:48,639
what each of these things do Jay stop

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,639
there we go Jay s talk very similar

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,620
around what data type it is Oh

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:13,450
so now that WordPress has a very

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:15,000
full-fledged API built in rests API you

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,990
might want to start looking into

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,670
depending on how you're developing if

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,680
you want to use the REST API I know a

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,250
lot of people who are trying to go to

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,560
more towards using the WordPress

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,890
back-end and no front ends though they

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:35,320
call it headless headless WordPress so

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:37,779
if you're creating or you're using more

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,580
the API side of things well you might

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:42,640
want to document that as well

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,970
who's ever heard who's heard of apiary

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:50,170
or swagger swagger is the big one or at

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,210
least it used to be so it's a it's an

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,450
API documentation standard it's

00:15:52,210 --> 00:16:00,490
basically marked down with a little bit

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:02,950
of extra flair for for documenting like

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,920
what you should be passing to this API

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,279
what your expected return is what errors

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,420
you could get you know so API is seem to

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,250
use more of the the HTTP error codes

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,630
than anything else I've ever seen so

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:22,060
like 421 is unexpected entity which

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,860
means you've given it wrong data but

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,670
basically what you're doing is you're

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,270
expanding out the information that

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:34,390
someone would need to access that API

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:38,980
without touching your code so like

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,870
you'll see try to think of a good one

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,670
that's used it I've just done a lot of

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:49,029
or I've seen and I've done a few API

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,420
documentation but you know I'll actually

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,940
show you what I did recent

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,390
it's not wordpress based but you'll

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,390
forgive me

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:40,130
I like trap what

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,780
let's just go

00:17:49,430 --> 00:18:09,830
that right no that's not the right site

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:13,680
if your yeah that's right one all right

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:18,530
yeah I know yeah let's do it password

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,530
actually I don't have my phone on me I

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,540
probably should have planned this oh

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:32,450
wait yeah do you have another one

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,660
there's my

00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:08,429
Wow this projector is not happy okay so

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:10,950
this is an API so yeah so just it's it

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:14,490
literally is just a markdown document

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,140
that has a little bit more information

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,190
when it comes to you know what's

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,920
expected

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:33,960
what so like what the different errors

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:37,400
you can get this one it doesn't really

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,679
get into the nitty-gritty so like with

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,830
some of the more complex ones you can

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,250
actually it will actually give you like

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,140
kind of accordion style where you have

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,299
the different end points that you can

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,809
hit and you click on it and will

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,340
actually give you like a text

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:59,130
representation like like a paragraph of

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,960
what you what this end point does but

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,350
over on that side it actually shows you

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,450
the JSON that they like that the API

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:11,160
expects and then you scroll down and you

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,660
see the JSON that would be returned so

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,929
it's really it's a really robust

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:22,080
platform Swaggart does the same thing

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:25,860
but if you're getting into into using

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,429
and building AP is for the word for the

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,320
WordPress JSON API and a restful api

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,780
then you're going to want to maybe look

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,340
at this especially for like the stuff

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,040
that you're building on top of or if

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,340
you're expanding or if you're making

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,340
your own

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:56,960
yeah so phpdocumentor is for PHP code

00:20:52,929 --> 00:21:00,730
this is for someone who isn't necessary

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,559
your code but needs to get to your API

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,409
so when I say API I mean restful api

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:20,000
where they're sending just json data and

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:22,940
returning json data right however based

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,830
on so if you're providing this so let's

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:29,169
let's flip this on its head a little bit

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:32,929
let's say what you're building is very

00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:36,080
sensitive or like the person that you're

00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:41,750
building it for is not wanting the code

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:45,260
to be open source then what you want is

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,130
that but you want anyone or specific

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,409
people to go in and actually use the API

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,769
but not touch the code that's what this

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,769
is for

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:09,169
exactly

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:11,059
yep yep so yeah so again it's it's it's

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,710
gonna be very similar to I'll use your

00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,480
dog you know the document and that you

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,190
want to be verbose but not too verbose

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,130
you want to give them as much

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,130
information as they need and no fluff

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:30,139
yeah and as I said give every possible

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:33,379
use case error that you can think of so

00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:36,710
like if they pass a string that should

00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:38,870
be a number I mean PHP is pretty good

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,750
about switching it if it if it's a

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,629
string within a variety of anyway give

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,679
them what would show them what would be

00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:51,429
returned so like the go-to for incorrect

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:54,470
data is as I said earlier for 21 years

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:56,960
and what JSON data would be sent back if

00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,919
any because I mean when it comes to an

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,080
error a lot of api's will just send an

00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,289
error code back with an empty data set

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:10,820
but some people want you know of more

00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:14,870
robust information because for 21 yes

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,690
it's a specific HTTP error code but your

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,730
your code that created that API could

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,279
actually send back data saying this

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:26,090
field was passed with this data and it

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:29,600
should have been passed with this oh you

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:32,299
know there's there's varying chatter

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,909
about what those what that data like

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:40,039
error data should be sent back that's

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:42,049
completely up to you and your users and

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,309
yeah that's the other thing so the one

00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,000
that I was going to show you that I

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:50,000
couldn't remember the URL for I have

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,909
actually edited probably 30 times in the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,340
past six months because someone said oh

00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:57,799
what about this Oh didn't think of that

00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,310
it wasn't it was a project I inherited

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,830
so that helps matters

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,870
you know I didn't think of it but yeah

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,060
it's not it's not always readily

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:09,840
apparent to you even if you've written

00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,190
it how your API will act especially

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,050
because you're tapping into the

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:20,910
WordPress API there might be something

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:22,230
that you don't know about so yeah yeah

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,720
we kind of talked about this oh yeah

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,930
that's the other thing I've had at least

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,100
for developers that use the API that I

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:34,680
developed that I took over and said oh

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:38,250
this doesn't work ok did you read the

00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,400
documentation yeah well did you read the

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,470
part that said this part doesn't work

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:48,360
well no can we go back and read that

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:51,210
part so I actually took that chunk that

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,950
said so that's the other thing about API

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:59,730
a beber named Tom apiary it actually

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:03,180
creates a code snippets for people to

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:07,200
use but I still haven't figured out why

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:09,720
their code snippet doesn't work for my

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,840
API even though when you look at it and

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,980
you didn't dissect it it should but then

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,820
when I go into another tool called

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:24,420
postman which basically tests api's the

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,040
code that it creates does work so

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,360
there's probably a flag that I just

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:37,170
haven't really dug deep enough into that

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:39,300
that postman sets but not a peer yeah so

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,990
we talked about documenting the data

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:46,620
structures yeah leave as little room for

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,490
error as possible user guides no this is

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,110
the one that I found the most

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,170
interesting because I've never actually

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,540
written a user guide but it kind of did

00:25:52,170 --> 00:26:00,090
some digging some research and there's

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:04,560
kind of a prevailing theme keep the

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:08,460
jargon out of it so if there are is

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,870
internal jargon or developer jargon keep

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,210
it out

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:14,040
well if you were in the the last time

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,090
talking about Gutenberg and page

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,470
builders Nick talked about you know

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,070
JavaScript developers coming into the

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,840
fold because of how how Gutenberg is

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:30,360
built what does that mean to an end user

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:33,230
you have to explain it but that was that

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:37,730
you not that Java school JavaScript is

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:39,860
sort of jargon but at the end of the day

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:44,270
what does that mean for the unusu

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,400
you'd say oh this is built on JavaScript

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,860
okay

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,540
what does that mean for me I've never

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,190
touched a line of code in my look I'm

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,600
not saying that's me but I've never

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,669
touched a line of code in my life I'm

00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,169
installing a plug-in because it's built

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,330
on JavaScript what does that mean

00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,030
what does that mean for my site what

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:06,000
does that mean for my customers

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:08,520
so keep the jargon out of it or if you

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:17,540
need to explain it with jargon explain

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:22,799
the jargon that's jargon leet it's so so

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:28,440
leet it's it's hacker speak basically

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:31,020
for aletheia exactly yeah yeah so like

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,669
and know your audience is it is it a

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,799
novice is it for someone who's just

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:38,010
starting out or do you know for a fact

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,350
that it's gonna be a pro user or a

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,350
developer you know and is that developer

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,809
new is that developer you know use plain

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,600
language keep it simple no long

00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:50,190
paragraphs point form is actually better

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,730
especially when you're talking about

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,679
like step-by-step instructions don't get

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,419
into it like don't put like step step

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,840
step and then a paragraph about what's

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:04,950
happening at this point if it's relevant

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,190
okay if the user could care less of it

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:10,669
just keep it out I don't think it's

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,669
necessary

00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:21,060
yeah that's another thing what does your

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,040
project song I mean that's if we're

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,950
talking about a wordpress plugin that's

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,260
gonna be a your front page like what

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:33,360
what does your plug-in do because

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:35,310
sometimes the name you if you want to be

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,320
creative with your name that may not

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:41,130
tell at the end user what it is or what

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:46,110
it does so that first paragraph needs to

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:50,370
be the elevator pitch what does your

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:52,470
plug-in do what does it go different you

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,730
know as I said step-by-step instructions

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:59,880
frequently asked questions how and where

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,560
to get support plug-in the the nice

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,440
thing is that's that's kind of a built

00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,530
in thing with with plugins because it

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,350
has it has the wordpress.org chats and I

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:13,230
should know that's right I'm thinking a

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,320
lot but yeah so it kind of has that

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:20,430
built in but if you get to a point where

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,740
you're building commercial plugins or

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,050
like pay for support plug-ins really

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,850
boils down to where are those people

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,270
going to get their supports because if

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,620
your plug-in isn't on the repository

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:35,520
where are they going to go is if it's

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:39,960
just an email address fine but I would

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:43,680
go so far as to have a like a user forum

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,720
or because I mean BB press perfect

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,130
perfect example there's something to

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:56,280
throw it really easy trying to think oh

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:59,820
um Zendesk there's a half a dozen things

00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,290
that are free for small sites and then

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,110
maybe need to start paying for if it

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,610
gets a little bigger but yeah I mean by

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,430
all means you need to have a place that

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,290
are like a knowledge base where you know

00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,450
if someone asks a question you go oh I

00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:16,310
didn't even think of that right a small

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:21,080
step by step or a small article about it

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,080
screenshots did I mention screenshots

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,070
yeah four times that's not just for I

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,570
probably should have done a little bit

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:31,510
more but no you know when when they're

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:36,010
when you're going through a step by step

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:39,020
bit screenshots are invaluable you know

00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:42,170
depending on how someone learns will be

00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,170
you can you have the text and you have

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,700
the image some people will just look at

00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,710
the image and go oh that's what happens

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,290
there they won't even look at the text

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,730
so if if at all possible have as much

00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,990
have as many images as you can

00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:04,610
that kind of stuck them through the

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:07,880
process and this is my guiding principle

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:11,180
when it comes to commenting to documents

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,420
creating these regards if you were to so

00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,830
you're developing something it's amazing

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,270
you're giving it out to people but if

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:24,230
they don't know how to use it okay so it

00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:25,940
flipped that around if you went out grab

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,380
the plugin because you knew that it

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,510
would do exactly what you need to do but

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,030
you had no idea how to use it because

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:37,610
they didn't do documentation how would

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:41,420
that make you feel like if you spent an

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:43,670
extra hour or five hours or ten hours

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,320
because you knew that that person or

00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:48,610
that plug-in did what you needed it to

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,610
do but you just don't know how to do it

00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,670
you're just creating headaches around

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,670
the world

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:21,170
I'd be interested to hear and chat about

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:26,390
it I agree and that's and that's where

00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:30,010
oh yeah well and that's and that's I

00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:32,420
said a couple times that brevity is key

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,130
give them enough information don't give

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,750
them too much and that goes across

00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,910
everything that goes with commenting

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:43,670
that goes with documentation whether

00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:46,010
it's for an API or or a user job they

00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:52,540
the end user will not want to wade

00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:56,180
through paragraphs of your life story I

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,750
just want to use your plug in this get

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,280
over it you know yeah exactly which

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:07,820
button do i click I need to do this

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:10,880
which one do I put well not that anyone

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,950
does that but you're right in commenting

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,220
especially in commenting I find user

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,550
guides to be way too brief and not

00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:25,430
detailed enough at least on the plug-in

00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:30,070
repository but I don't know where I was

00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:37,130
going with that proponents in yes sorry

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:40,010
for commenting I find when it's it seems

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,680
to be either end of the spectrum I find

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,170
very few and I will be the first person

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,410
to be honest that I don't comment it up

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:56,270
and I catch myself like I actually

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:57,240
looked at another client thing that I'm

00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,730
working on I

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,640
I've been documenting at all like not

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,370
crap I need to go back and do that you

00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:09,600
know again even if it's just the dock

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:13,290
blocks for the classes the methods you

00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,840
know breaking up my CSS to be you know

00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,720
based on this screen or the the area of

00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:22,940
the site that I'm working on so that

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,550
you're not wading through you know I

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,170
think my biggest projects that I worked

00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:32,430
on not alone

00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:35,640
I was 10,000 lines of CSS and the

00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:40,140
original person put it in one file and

00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,990
no comments so I mean the nice thing was

00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:46,680
they were a little bit descriptive with

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:49,020
their divs so I was able to find things

00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,730
relatively easy but it still took me

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,660
about three weeks to really get

00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,650
comfortable and this was like a

00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,510
long-term project

00:34:52,650 --> 00:35:02,180
so yeah I mean you're right there there

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:06,600
is there is a fine line between that

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:12,000
that line is that's good commenting this

00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:17,130
is too much this is too little where

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,720
you'll and that's that's completely up

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,120
to you and again it's it's gonna come

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,720
down to the code that you write and the

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,600
comments that you write may make perfect

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,020
sense to you but I would almost err on

00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,840
the side of too much versus too little

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,930
yes there is a good that there's enough

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:42,060
there there's no that you know that zone

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:46,200
of the right amount but I would go a

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,000
little bit more because weight again

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,980
comes down to what you think makes sense

00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:13,230
may not make sense to someone else yeah

00:35:52,980 --> 00:36:16,320
uh so basically it comes down to as you

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:22,560
said doing a dog block for a class and

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:25,260
for your methods I know a lot of seen

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,880
lots of classes where they have a doc

00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,570
box for each individual class property

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,490
it's like okay that's a little overkill

00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:39,090
because like it's not doing anything

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:43,980
when you declare it that's where you

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:47,070
know a well named variable is is better

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:54,510
than a big piece of like a big dog block

00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:58,100
just for a variable name so yeah but

00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:03,380
like going down my my my minimum is

00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:06,570
class method and if I feel the need I

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,480
will like separate out a block and put a

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:13,560
comment at the top like if there's like

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,030
if a function or a method does this

00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,580
thing but it has like kind of three

00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:21,359
steps I'll check it out whether I put

00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:23,790
comments or not but if one part I write

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,980
a little shorter for brevity's sake or

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,980
for four

00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,820
efficiency then I will definitely put a

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,100
comment above it saying this is what

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,900
this does I'm sorry it's t-shirt there's

00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,820
something you know and I usually put a

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,740
joke in my comments somewhere there's at

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,830
least one joke and every project that

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,390
I've worked on but yeah that's kind of

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:52,280
that's kind of the minimum for me and

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:56,600
then when it comes to Jay s is similar

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:59,750
to PHP I try and do objects where I can

00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,030
because that kind of again makes for

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:05,630
more readable code rather than just a

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:09,950
bunch of jQuery callbacks I can be kind

00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:12,230
of annoying but and then CSS it's kind

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,530
of just depending on if you're doing you

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:17,890
know sass or less that makes it for more

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,090
readable CSS but at the end of the day

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:25,550
depending on you know who you're talking

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:28,010
to what the what the expectation is I

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,410
will at least chunk out my my CSS and

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,070
put like this is for these our home page

00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,630
styles or this is a specific block style

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:38,960
or these are blocks tiles that sort of

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:42,140
thing but again it's it's completely up

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,530
to you but you know that's kind of my

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,530
minimal

00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:01,600
I think it does well and at the end of

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,820
the day when you when it spits out if

00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:10,000
you haven't put a dock block it will be

00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:12,820
very obvious yeah as phpdocumentor does

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,280
I think it gives you a report once it's

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,430
done so I I would I would have to look

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,970
into that but phpdocumentor dot net I

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,560
think is the site but just do a search

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:34,180
for a PHP documenter and it's great

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:36,730
actually I have if you want to take a

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,970
picture that that's all the yeah that's

00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:43,350
all the references usually does yeah PHP

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,350
docked at forward actually is

00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:58,119
no agenda on there but they had good

00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,469
jazz documentation standards so there

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,160
were very much similar to a piece we

00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:06,039
don't yeah yeah yeah no problem right

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:11,769
Wow that way longer than I expected

00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:13,539
any other questions y'all good

00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,229
well thanks for coming out to work in

00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,229
