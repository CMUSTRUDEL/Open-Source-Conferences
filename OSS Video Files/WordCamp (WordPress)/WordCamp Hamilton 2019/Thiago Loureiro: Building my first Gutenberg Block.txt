Title: Thiago Loureiro: Building my first Gutenberg Block
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	This technical session is for developers as well as users with at least a little coding experience. After a brief introduction to what Gutenberg is and what it can do, the presentation will show simple bits of code and demonstrate how these bits of code translate into a Gutenberg block.
Building a Gutenberg block is very simpleGutenberg blocks make the editing experience a lot richer

hi everyone

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,410
before I start before we start if you

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,910
guys have any questions

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,650
if you don't understand what I'm saying

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,029
or if you don't agree with what I'm

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,619
saying or if you have your opinions

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,680
everyone to expend something that I'm

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:26,890
seeing here feel free to interrupt me

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,789
don't just just say whatever you want to

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:36,040
say it's a order to make us feel this as

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:38,739
fergus possible and thank you to all the

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,300
organizers they they're donating their

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:48,340
time to make this happen so thanks to

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:53,140
them also the volunteers so thank you

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:57,160
guys whenever you can please say thanks

00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:00,550
to them so the format of this talk will

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,770
be I'll be answering questions simple

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:08,550
questions and they're going to be 18

00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:10,470
questions and it's just going to be

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,520
they're gonna be simple

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:20,770
mostly I'll be showing some code and

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:25,000
also concepts so the intention is not to

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:29,500
give the full knowledge of how to build

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,130
a wordpress blog I think it's more like

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,929
to give directions on where to go we if

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,750
you want to build one or get a better

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:39,630
idea of what Gooden Berg is I think

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,369
everyone here in this room will have

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,170
something to take from this presentation

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,869
and that's that's my intention here and

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll be available or like you does the

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:52,300
slides are going to be online they don't

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,130
line right now but okay and also the

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,479
code that I'm going to be using it's

00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,179
also going to be available so the rest

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,630
of the questions and the first question

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:06,849
is what is with murder you're going to

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,060
hear many many different ways to

00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:13,360
describe what Gutenberg is my version is

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:18,769
it's just so a different way to edit

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,050
content and WordPress that's it

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:25,230
this here on the left is how the editor

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,440
used to look like and the right is the

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,049
Gutenberg way which is just so here is

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,659
just like sequential text you right and

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,000
you format your text and in that way

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:40,950
you're just building blocks your contact

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,049
is your content is if I didn't blocks it

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,450
just rearranged then you can reuse them

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,819
on the left side here you cannot it's

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,010
it's really hard to reuse stuff right

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,010
but on the right side you can it's easy

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:58,489
and they encourage you to reuse content

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:02,849
reuse templates and stuff like that so

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:06,989
expanding that the right screen there

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:10,049
it's here it doesn't look like blocks

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:13,349
but these are box the top one is a block

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:16,049
is the classic block which behaves the

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,940
same way as the old editor what you see

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,120
here all the color police go through

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,669
abilities of formatting there also there

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,450
right you can have the same experience

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,769
on that block but you can have way more

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,190
the image block which is a simple block

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,109
that will add an image there is the list

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:39,569
block it's just blocked at the list

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:43,049
stuff right code block and what else and

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,599
this by the way can you yeah it there is

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:50,150
a columns block so this column's block

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:56,609
is dividing so defining the content into

00:03:50,150 --> 00:04:00,299
left column right column this is a block

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:04,260
a simple one is a button a button can be

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,169
a block it's a small small simple block

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,870
and you can you have the options here

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,340
see how I'm compressing stuff I'm gonna

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,590
puree ting and all these options they're

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,229
only relevance to buttons you're not

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,289
going to find more options than you need

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,289
here right it's just like the caller how

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:26,270
you want the fax to shoot to show and

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:26,270
the alignment of this button

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,810
so these are all the blocks that are

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,480
available inside go to mercury now there

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,230
are a lot of them and they're really

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,140
cool to play with if you install if you

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,380
have the latest version of WordPress it

00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,630
will come all with all this stuff right

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:55,620
these are that's probably my favorite

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:58,440
parts of this in that one's okay and why

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,760
would I need to build my own Guttenberg

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,110
block why we need to know about that

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,700
there are some cases I think sometimes

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,350
you want a specific block you want a

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,320
specific structure that is not there by

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:19,110
default you can try to create your own

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,640
that's one of reasons and now so

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,090
sometimes I think the best one is you

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,590
can modify existing blocks so there will

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,690
be German to be plugins that will

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,419
provide you with blocks and sometimes

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,220
you want to tweak them a little bit and

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,840
if you know how to build a block you

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,210
also know how to modify it I think

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:44,130
that's really powerful and also by the

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:46,650
way there's a way to search inside the

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,150
WordPress marketplace the place to

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,900
search for plugins in WordPress there's

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:56,810
a way to search for plugins that will

00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:01,100
also give you blocks their block enabled

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,100
plugins so if you go here

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:25,000
anyway pretend that it's showing you out

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:27,250
here anyway

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,900
it's just going to show you yeah all

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,170
these plugins here they are not plugins

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,340
that will only provide you with blocks

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:38,050
they will also have some blocks

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,820
available or they will modify existing

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,630
blocks and stuff like that

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,790
and yos for example has interesting

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,260
blocks in the in the latest versions I

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:52,090
think an FAQ block they provide you the

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,430
blocks in did with the advantage that

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,580
they also provide you the ratio for them

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,040
so I think Yost has to kind of

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,060
structured blocks one is FAQ and the

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:07,540
other one is how to very specific if you

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,860
want to format your content your content

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,860
in this wise I use to provide you block

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
okay

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,370
is it a plugin is it a theme it's it's

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,750
not a plug-in it's not a ploy it's

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,450
nothing it it's something that can live

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:34,610
inside a plug-in or it can live inside

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:38,450
the theme to it depends sometimes you

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:43,400
want to create your theme with with

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:45,200
blocks and sometimes you want to create

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,570
your plug-in with blocks who can really

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,870
use it it's up to it depends on the

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:58,340
problem to have in the end so it depends

00:07:50,870 --> 00:08:01,070
the answer for that is the bench okay so

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,760
the one we are going to build one of the

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,050
first it's very very very simple block

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,590
that we're going to build is going to be

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,970
this one

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,950
hello block and that's how the whole

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:18,230
workflow so I'm here I'm adding the

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:20,810
block I'm searching for it okay basic

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,850
block once I click it just displays it

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,690
it's just text I cannot even add it this

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,790
part not in the editor and then once I

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,160
publish I have the same content that I

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:37,719
was seeing in the editor there well link

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,990
was just true I know JavaScript a lot of

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:50,480
the code of a block will be inside

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:54,260
JavaScript PHP not so much it's going to

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:59,450
be kind of standard way of or of dealing

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,360
with PHP code for different plugins but

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,050
JavaScript says it's where the heavy

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,120
logic is and CSS if you want to style

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,950
make your block

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,950
look pretty see this

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,360
what's a good way to start a good number

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,130
block so I think there to wait one of

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,260
them is used as repo here on github is

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,579
maintained by the WordPress people it's

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,310
called a Guttenberg examples and they

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:36,519
have like one two three four like around

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:40,360
ten plugins that they showcase the

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,920
capabilities of Guttenberg and these are

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,050
the ones by the way the code that I'm

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:50,350
going to show here are modifications of

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:53,560
some of these plugins here really simple

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,730
really straightforward and in one of the

00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:03,160
best ways to know to learn how to build

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:05,680
them another way to start a good

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,269
temporary block from scratch is using

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:14,829
this tool here called crate gluten block

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:16,029
by this guy here I've met Oh Weiss do

00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:21,240
you think that's how you pronounce his

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:23,620
name if you guys are familiar with react

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,300
there is a tool there's a similar tool

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,750
for react called create react add that

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:35,380
this kind of just gives you the initial

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:40,839
structure of a react project this is the

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:43,899
same kind of idea it's just a an NPM use

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:49,260
NPM to to start and is going to create a

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:53,320
basic structure for you so you can just

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,110
give the name you want and it's going to

00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,699
give you the builders all the stuff that

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:04,949
you're going to need here is the repo on

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,949
github if you guys want to check out

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,029
okay now let's let's start building it

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,029
then

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:25,740
remember that block that I showed you

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:28,920
here this guy here once you publish

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:34,610
that's why do you see that good from

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:39,930
Bert block is here just this code right

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:43,320
one file one PHP file in one JavaScript

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:51,300
file that's it you can that's like the

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:54,590
bare minimum for Farah block there's the

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,850
example again you guys saw that

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:01,590
okay and now I'm going to try it I'm

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:09,300
going to try to explain how that what's

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:12,630
what's going on and there's this code so

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,730
the PHP part this file here should be

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,850
living inside a plug-in in this case

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,650
will be instead of plugging okay so the

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:25,770
index dot V dot PHP file this call here

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:29,720
probably some of you are familiar with

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:34,530
it it's just the old way to link you

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,620
scripts in WordPress right you're just

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:42,300
defining an alias and you're going to

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:48,210
define up a path to a javascript file

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:52,260
and here the dependencies off this

00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,870
javascript file this is not new this was

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,560
always like it's been part of wordpress

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,790
for a long time you're registering a

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,860
javascript file and this is javascript

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,840
file happens to be the one that is going

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,960
to define your block so a lot of the

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,490
heavy logic is going to be inside this

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:15,290
javascript here here this call here

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,290
register block type that's the new one

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:24,550
you're saying that you're giving a name

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,200
to your block we have a prefix

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,000
a prefix is important here because of

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:33,790
collision right because you don't want

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,620
like to when you're creating a block you

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,230
don't want to have the same name of a

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,600
previously created block or a plug-in

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,690
that is going to in the future have the

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,700
same brilliant idea of naming a block

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,650
block or something you know like just

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:52,020
just prefix with the name of your

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,020
company or something or your last name

00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:02,020
remember this part here we're going to

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,900
come back to later and in in the part

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,790
that I say editor script basic block

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,270
what is basic block is binding to dis

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,630
guy here whatever script I define here

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,200
the alias is going to be the same one

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:22,950
that I'm going to describe here so this

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:27,300
binds to this here and this is just so

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:34,420
like regular WordPress transition

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:37,480
plug-in stuff right so that's the new

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:44,200
part the j/s part inside your javascript

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:47,710
file you have remember on the last slide

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,140
that previous light here whatever name

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,380
you defined is going to be used again

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,380
here

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,260
and these are the attributes and

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:13,029
functions of your block all the blocks

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,610
will need an edit function and a save

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,850
function and some attributes basically

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,000
that's that's how they that's the basic

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,770
structure of them the title is going to

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,140
be how it's going to be presented on the

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,950
screen when I search for a block I can I

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,880
will type basic space space block and

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm going to have my block available

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,710
there the category is just a way to

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,920
organize the blocks what you saw on the

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,660
example that blocks are divided because

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,930
there are so many blocks they kind of

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:48,400
divide it then into categories so it's

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:54,430
kind of easier to go through them the

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:57,839
added function is how the the block is

00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:01,000
going to behave inside guttenberg screen

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,500
when you are editing you're defining

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,810
this behavior here the save function is

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:13,060
saying when I hit publish how that block

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,570
that I'm editing there is going to be

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,540
stored in the database so here's the

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,770
same thing I'm creating an element P a

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,480
paragraph and the context the the thing

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:30,250
that will go inside this paragraph is

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:36,010
hello block when I save it I'm saying

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:37,540
I'm saying generate a piece of HTML with

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,920
a paragraph and the content of this

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,700
paragraph is going to be hello block

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:47,490
I can't edit this and the editor nothing

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,490
like that is just a static dumb block

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,030
again

00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:01,850
I'm going to type basic block now I'm

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,850
going to yeah there it is

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,280
any questions

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:34,100
so the question is what happens if I put

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:35,810
a hashtag like here you can we're going

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,150
to see better examples of this later I

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,550
actually you're supposed to do that

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,650
you're supposed to build your HTML in

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,500
this part and the save function in the

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:50,500
edit function as well that's going to be

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:53,500
the next example any other questions

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
yep

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,620
a troubleshooting see it as like if

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,150
you're trying to create a block and

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:09,220
somehow your block is not working I

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,600
think right now there's WordPress is not

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,190
really going to tell you oh there's

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,610
something broken and I'm not going to

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,920
display anything so look for Chrome

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,330
developer tools always be searching for

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,840
that and that happened with me a lot

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,580
when I was preparing this presentation I

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,850
was expecting the block to be there to

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,960
be searchable but it was not so I open

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,150
Chrome and it was like oh there's a

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,200
error in your JavaScript because of the

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,669
heavy logic is in JavaScript right

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,630
whatever errors they're going to be

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,340
there they're going to be JavaScript

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,169
okay

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:49,270
can we make this simpler and the insert

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:52,960
then got is yes this is I don't know if

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:59,350
you guys are familiar with react but

00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:02,200
there are nicer ways to to write this

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,150
code and it is it helps to understand

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:11,740
better too I think because it gets rid

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:15,040
of a lot of it just gets smaller any I

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,450
think for me it makes you I can

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,130
understand it better when it's kind of a

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:24,940
smaller and I can kind of this and

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:30,840
what's what goes where okay so there

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:34,510
remember this guy here you can come this

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,030
it's way shorter and that says I think

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:41,470
that was your question if I could put

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:43,390
actual actual HTML there yes you can but

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,440
if you guys know JavaScript you know

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,510
this is insane

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:52,480
like you're like you shouldn't put HTML

00:19:48,510 --> 00:20:00,160
tags in the middle of your JavaScript

00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:04,690
code so that's where we talk about here

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,620
again the comparison this to you do the

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,790
same thing the very same thing if I if I

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,290
whatever block I was reading here is

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,240
going to display the same way

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:23,130
in the Gutenberg editor and is going to

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:27,400
display the same way when I publish and

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,960
again this part here having HTML in the

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,530
middle of your JavaScript code this is

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,180
called JSX

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:41,770
it's just a it's not part of of

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:45,460
JavaScript it's like an extended way to

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:49,330
write JavaScript code and you need it

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,670
rationally in India a tool that will

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,620
take this code and will transform this

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,440
code in something that your browser can

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,630
understand if you try to run this in the

00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,200
browser your it's going to break it

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,020
doesn't work

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,110
browsers can't understand this so we

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:12,820
need a tool to get this code and make

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:18,040
something else another concept is yes

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,190
next it's just like I think developers

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:28,710
they want to be always using the latest

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:28,710
versions of JavaScript we don't want to

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:37,720
really like be always thinking about IE

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,760
11 for example the code I'm writing in

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,840
JavaScript has to be compatible with IE

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,400
11 this classic problem and because we

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,020
want to be using this thing here right

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:54,100
we want to be using the latest stuff

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:58,590
available for JavaScript and if you'll

00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:02,290
go back here at it this way of writing

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:04,000
JavaScript also doesn't work in IE 11 if

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,420
you try to write a function in the

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,090
middle of up this object here it's going

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,210
to break modern browsers will take that

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,940
but not I 11 so you need a way to make

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,890
your browser or any browser including I

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:25,290
11 understand this craziness here and

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:25,290
this kind of modern syntax of JavaScript

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:39,880
and that's that's where we use babble

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:43,179
and webpack by the way you don't have to

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,770
understand have a deep end assemble what

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:49,720
Babel is or buy a pack and in the two in

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,270
the two projects that I showed on how to

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,370
start with numbered block they are

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,470
provided with all the configurations for

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:02,169
you you just need to run npm build or

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:05,140
whatever so this two are going to get

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:11,190
your very cool code that your browser

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:14,559
can't understand and will produce bigger

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,049
file with lots of javascript you don't

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,390
really need to read but your browser

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,590
will understand so this is this you are

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:26,830
kind of doing the translation work and

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,620
i'm going to show you how the two

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,419
side-by-side this files in the end are

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:36,640
going to do the same thing it's not

00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:41,279
adding any functionality so this tiny

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:47,380
guy here browser can't understand this a

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:49,330
developer can i can but the browser will

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,120
understand this guy here and they do the

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,370
same thing it's just one is the

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,520
translation it's a translated version of

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,520
the other

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:17,150
okay any questions on this part okay and

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:21,260
the next block is and the last one too

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:25,760
is if I want a block that I can edit I

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:28,310
think that's more useful to understand

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,890
how I can create a block that the user

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:34,400
can go inside Guttenberg and add some

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,830
information inside a block this one is a

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:42,470
dumb block but I want one that can that

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:46,130
I can add information so I want so

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:55,670
that's my editable block

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:58,130
I didn't format the font so whatever I

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,400
typed you was already in that format you

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:05,060
see like black back background and white

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:07,850
letters it comes with style ready I

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,980
don't need to rely on the user to to add

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:17,090
the proper style and also comic sentence

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:21,280
by the way the proper font for that is

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,280
it showing when I publish or not

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,830
yeah once I hit publish what I'm seeing

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,389
there is exactly what I got in the front

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:39,460
end and I think that's one of the major

00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:41,590
advantages of Gutenberg kind of gets the

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:46,389
experience that you're getting into

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:57,250
editor it's going to look much closer in

00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:58,600
the front end ok so what's so that's

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,679
another block whatever we saw before

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,679
forget it

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:12,940
that's a new block same thing this was

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:15,220
the other block as well a title a way it

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:19,029
can go inside good American's search for

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,289
this block the category kind of same

00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:26,879
kind of principle this is new is the

00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:29,379
attribute a block will have an attribute

00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:32,889
that will hold the information that

00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:34,899
you're editing in this case in the case

00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:36,730
of this block there is only one thing

00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:38,409
that I want to save here this is a

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,909
static this is this won't change the

00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:44,019
user won't be able to change this

00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:46,629
beautiful image just the content that

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:52,620
goes here and that's what I'm calling

00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:55,960
content does i defined the selector says

00:26:52,620 --> 00:27:01,240
you're going to get this information the

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:05,440
content information will come from HTML

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:10,149
and a div inside HTML there are other

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:16,419
ways to store this information but the

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:19,149
one I picked was HTML there are other

00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:21,039
ways you can either I think the basic

00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:27,549
ways of storing this information is

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:29,830
either in HTML or inside meta I think

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,450
most of the basic blocks are the blocks

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,549
that will come with WordPress they will

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,309
store an information inside the HTML

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:40,590
that is produced and Gutenberg this is

00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:40,590
smart enough to throw the HTML

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,120
make the gutenberg block so he can go

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:54,640
whenever I saved this this is saved in

00:27:49,430 --> 00:28:00,170
pure HTML it goes to the database as

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,110
HTML when I when I press when I go to

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,330
the page there's no translation process

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:13,520
happening whatever is in that page was

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:15,770
already a nation but at that point so

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,760
Wittenberg has to know how to rebuild

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:28,220
the block from HTML and display in the

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:31,370
actor okay again I'm going to have an

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,050
edit and save function so this is my

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,710
edit function a little bit bigger now

00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:40,370
and my save function again this to

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,770
always have this two in mind this time

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,760
is a little bit it's a little more bit

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:50,360
more complicated one it has a front loop

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,570
it has a fragment element here which is

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:59,270
just an element that can group other

00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:03,560
elements the image the cat image that

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:07,520
I'm using there and rich text editor

00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:11,410
which is this guy here whenever I start

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,410
typing here that that's a rich text

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:21,020
editor that will translate to a div this

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,430
is just unchanged this is kind of

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,080
reactive for guys you used to react

00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,250
you're going to understand what does

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:33,700
this do a way I'm now going to go in

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:38,780
much detail here but the save function

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:41,570
will have a similar kind of code that I

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:44,420
have in the Edit one if you're seeing

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,090
the image is going to be the same the

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,770
image that I'm seeing in Gutenberg is

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,810
going to be the image that I want to see

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,910
in the front end right

00:29:52,810 --> 00:30:01,430
and also the content this is this is

00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:06,730
where the the black text the text with

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,730
black background and white letters go on

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,870
the style is going to be defined what to

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:16,730
show you guys this is inline CSS but I'm

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,370
adding here and I'm saying

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:23,120
whenever I saved this I want this to be

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:31,880
saved as a div so this will go as HTML

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:36,700
called to the database yeah that's how

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:40,580
it looks the whole thing and the style

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,530
the style that I'm referencing here and

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,870
I'm referencing here so they have the

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,790
same style the part that is going to be

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,210
displayed and Gothenburg will have this

00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,240
style and the part that is going to be

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,740
stored in the database and later

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,390
displayed in the front-end will have

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:05,110
this style and also an image style which

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,110
is this guy here any questions

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,670
again that's the block we got in the end

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,180
okay and that's how it looks in HTML if

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:25,850
you're looking at this in the front-end

00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:28,450
after you save and already tired of

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:33,910
seeing this so many times

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:35,030
sorry can't confess for this the give

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,370
okay

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:39,590
if you press view source from the

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,840
front-end page that's what you're going

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:49,340
to see there's nothing special here

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:51,380
there's no JavaScript it's just HTML if

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,080
you roll back I don't know if you can do

00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,300
the same if you have that classic editor

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,940
plugin you say you know what I don't

00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,450
want I don't want to use go to editor

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,030
anymore I want to use the classic editor

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,230
you're still going to have this saved in

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,210
your database and it's going to display

00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:13,970
I think it's going to displace him why

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,390
it was if it was a block or not it

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,240
doesn't matter

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,860
that's HTML what was generated in the

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,320
end and what's generated in the end is

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,550
HTML and that's what goes into the

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,670
database and that's what's it's it's

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:33,650
display okay so that's about the end of

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:37,340
the presentation and just some

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:39,440
directions to go from here there are way

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,630
more complicated blocks than that there

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,380
are many many types of controls you can

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,210
add in your block and so for now we just

00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:51,110
use a simple tax one there you can go

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:56,960
really really crazy and add like color

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:59,060
pickers and stuff like that so and one

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,000
of them is dynamic blocks to which which

00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:08,330
kind of retrieves information from the

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,130
back hand to create your block these are

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,720
the fancy blocks that I'm talking about

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:18,170
the next kind of next-level blocks the

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,330
attributes are where you can store the

00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,960
information of your block if you can

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,270
find here

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,660
and one of them is an interesting yan is

00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,610
Metta you can instead instead of storing

00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,220
whatever information that is in your

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,990
block inside the HTML there's going to

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:38,600
be displayed you can store it in meta

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:43,280
ACF takes a lot of this complication out

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:47,510
for you so and that's version in version

00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,360
5.8 it helps a lot and you can define

00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,770
most of your block in PHP if you're used

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,290
to PHP you don't want to we don't want

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:58,070
to mess with JavaScript or react stuff

00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:01,220
or whatever you can use this F and

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:04,520
they're kind of they're starting their

00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,610
support with with guttenberg but the

00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:12,890
code required for this is it's way way

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:14,480
less than what I showed here it's a good

00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,310
opportunity I don't I don't think you

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,820
need a pro account for that I think that

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:22,340
the basic version will offer that the

00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:26,030
REST API you can build your blocks and

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:28,100
make them call the REST API in the

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:32,570
front-end it's it's a way of doing it

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:37,400
it's just crazy

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:41,840
and the code is here it's also I if you

00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:46,060
go to my Twitter account I'll have those

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:52,690
there and also the presentation slides

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,690
and that's it questions

00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:10,450
so okay let me so the question is what

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:16,810
is bobble remember this code here that I

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:18,780
showed I don't want to write that much

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:23,980
code like it I want to make it simpler

00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:26,109
but and then I write like this that's

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,760
true we'll do the same thing but in this

00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,650
one it's kind of easier to understand

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,910
what's going on what's going on there

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,190
but browsers won't understand that it's

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,320
easier for programmers to understand

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,099
what's going on but browsers won't

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,990
understand it

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:45,700
so Babel will get this and transform

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:50,190
into something that browsers can

00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:53,349
understand including ie 11 I 11 is

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:56,320
problematic or I whatever ie version

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,980
there is a problematic with support for

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,500
JavaScript a lot of stuff historically

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,990
it works on all the browsers except I 11

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,369
so Bible kind of takes this complication

00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:13,030
of Y and it gets this code and it

00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:16,089
translates to that code that could only

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,830
you don't need to read that you don't

00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:20,440
need to give to your fellow developer to

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,070
read that that's what you should be

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,560
worried about

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:30,869
but Babel will get whatever you're right

00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:33,940
here and make readable for browsers so

00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:36,339
it will make work so as a developer you

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:41,290
can just worry about this making code

00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:42,849
that is that makes sense for you and you

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:47,980
you have to run a command this is not

00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:50,109
just not this doesn't happen like magic

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,580
like you have to run build your your

00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:58,480
java scripts the process of building

00:36:51,580 --> 00:37:02,250
your javascript which is defined here it

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,250
will produce this javascript here

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:27,280
you had a question oh you can't it's

00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:30,370
better actually I think you can write

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,280
like and cue in your theme actually

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,230
instead of associate associating its

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,420
with the block but actually you can

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:44,010
actually start where is the call the

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:49,090
part of you in queue you're in queueing

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:54,460
your scripts in PHP this part here you

00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:56,560
can also defines CSS yes you can define

00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,200
one CSS that is go only going to be

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,110
available inside the editor and one CSS

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,400
that is going to be available for

00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:07,840
front-end only for that block or you can

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:14,910
go the other way and just make it level

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:14,910
one and riff again one question there

00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:26,550
sure it's it's a request to go back to

00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,550
the warrior to go from here is light

00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:46,490
yeah sure I'll go back to this later so

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:57,680
the request was to go to explain again

00:38:46,490 --> 00:39:07,840
what is JSX the role yet it's just right

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:12,590
so no no this sorry

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:16,040
the you're writing this code which makes

00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:20,450
sense for the developers or like it's

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:22,040
it's easier to understand than this if

00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,740
you look at this you say oh this is

00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,720
going to return a paragraph with hello

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,660
body inside when you look at this here

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,380
that's like I don't know I don't what's

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:37,100
going on it's just it makes more

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:40,210
readable for developers but the browser

00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,210
won't understand it

00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,100
[Music]

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,080
so Babel is a tool the the the question

00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,940
is what's the difference between JSX and

00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:54,170
bubble so bubble is a tool that was

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,850
going to get this guy here the this very

00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,390
nice code that the browser can't

00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:02,890
understand and make the browser and make

00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:09,920
something else a translated version of

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:14,990
this you get this block here your nice

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:18,250
with JSX you run bubble and it becomes

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:20,600
another file that will do the same thing

00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:24,330
but there's one the browser will

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:29,870
understand so once you read

00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:36,150
cool yeah there's your run npm run build

00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:37,980
it generates this and it's hard to read

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,460
this don't-don't-don't you don't need to

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,960
read that but it does the same thing

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,960
right this you'll do the first hindi

00:40:45,380 --> 00:41:09,360
more question you know okay this one

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:12,260
oh the the two versions okay the long

00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,260
version and the

00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,020
this is yeah this is valid your browser

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:50,200
can on this in that your browser can

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:52,839
understand that it's in this year and

00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,059
that's our requirement you can write

00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:59,710
your gutenberg blocks like this and get

00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:03,160
this bubble thing out of the way up to

00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,740
you right if you're used if you get used

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,170
to this go crazy you're eliminating like

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:14,200
this building prot like step out of your

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,480
workflow which is good but there's one I

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,500
I feel it's it's kind of nice to write

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,059
stuff like that like it's shorter you

00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,700
get a better sense of what's going on

00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:29,970
you don't need to remember the syntax

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,970
here element dog crater yeah

00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:48,400
so the question is how do I manage to

00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:52,670
update Guttenberg blocks without

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,309
validation errors the answer for that is

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,599
I don't know I had promised I had

00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:00,039
problems with that - I think that's one

00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:03,109
of the biggest problems with Guttenberg

00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,369
because this happens when your rights

00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:06,650
have blocked let's suppose we're writing

00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:09,770
this and all of sudden I say oh no

00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,660
there's not a P tag is an h1 tag and I

00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,549
have to update my blog and think that's

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,789
where you get the validation errors

00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:18,819
right if if there's anyone that knows

00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:21,819
how to manage this like since we really

00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:21,819
don't

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,880
yes

00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:43,839
it's a good point you can do server-side

00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:46,630
you can rely less on writing JavaScript

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,989
code and do more syrup server-side code

00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,319
which is what I mean in this server

00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:57,900
rendering blocks if you guys want to

00:43:52,319 --> 00:44:00,189
look with more detail what it will do

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,779
but yeah you can resolve when you have

00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:04,299
this validation errors you can resolve

00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:06,699
the conflict and stuff and it's never

00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:08,910
it's never it offers you right like you

00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:11,380
have a validation error say you want to

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:14,039
get rid like it gives you like two

00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:25,420
options in you can

00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:30,939
yeah convert to HTML like so they're

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:32,619
going to freak out yeah yeah I don't

00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:34,779
have I'm sorry I don't have I don't have

00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:40,839
an answer of that and I think I I also

00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:41,920
lost there as much as yeah but I think

00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:42,369
at some point they might attack this

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,369
problem

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:51,269
I hope or if they did already I don't

00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:51,269
know any other question

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:03,470
I think ACF as well if you use ACF the

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,670
creator blocks you probably not going to

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,130
have because you don't have to write any

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,940
JavaScript code if you're using ACF to

00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:12,710
write your blocks you will probably help

00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,190
you're all going to have less of these

00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,190
problems I think

00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:25,160
more questions

00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:29,690
all right thank you and here's all the

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,450
information you can find yeah on my

00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:36,350
Twitter the the slides are going to be

00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:38,300
there and my repo with the code samples

00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:43,490
that are used here feel free to contact

00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:46,400
