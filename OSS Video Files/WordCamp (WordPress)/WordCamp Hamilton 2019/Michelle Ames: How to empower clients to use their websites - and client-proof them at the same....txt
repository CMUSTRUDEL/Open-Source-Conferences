Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	Have you ever had a client insist on having admin access to their website? They own it, so they have that right…but how long did it take before they called you to fix what they broke once they logged in?
While clients who break their own sites are guaranteed revenue, those calls never come at a convenient time and are ALWAYS urgent.
So what can we do to both empower our clients and make sure their sites continue to run well?
This talk will present several ideas for ways that we can do just that, including:
Helpful pluginsHow to train a client in WordPressHow to set user permissionsHow to set pricing for fixing mistakesCreating a user manualOther tips for managing the client relationship
Attendees will leave with some good ideas and action items to better help clients help themselves…or not.

	00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,080
so we are here today to talk about how

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,360
to empower your clients to use their

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,969
websites and client proof them at the

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,789
same time and just a little bit about me

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,170
so I have the news and WordPress I think

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,560
I put ten plus years because I counted

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,300
wrong

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,769
about 10 years so almost 10 years

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,539
actually I founded word camp Rochester I

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,920
went to word camp u.s. in 2015 and I

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,910
said to them I'm a little nervous I

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,440
don't know which we have a big enough

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,809
face what do I have to do to start a

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,700
camp they said let's just do it I said

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,910
all right so we had our first word camp

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,190
Rochester and we are having our fourth

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,530
or fifth one this year so that's kind of

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,039
exciting I am launching a new podcast

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,559
called WP coffee talk and I want to talk

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,030

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,770
say I have a shameless plug I did write

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,570

first two people to either send me a

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,170

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,299
customers or your clients or ask a great

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,579

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,960
can find me at the after party I will

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,790
autograph a free copy of the book for

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,960
you so I have them with me if you're

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,790
interested in the book I've got them so

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,100
empowering our clients to use their

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,470
websites but also client proofing our

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,320
are the websites at the same time what

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,990
if I told you it was possible it really

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,790
is and you have to excuse me my glasses

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,860
fogged up because I get so excited when

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,490
I present that I suddenly can't see and

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,960
it's like you're all in a fog okay so we

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,069
have a spectrum of clients right we have

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,590
the clients that don't know how to use

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,490
their phone I have I am still that

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,930
would show up with a flip phone

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,090
say I really don't know anything about

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,100
the about the computer I love how and

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,870
like uh sometimes call the internet the

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,640
computer if they call the internet the

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,740
computer you can basically build

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,010
whatever you want and they will be happy

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,690
you can take three hours though the

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,540
crappiest site you've ever seen and

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,490
they're like I'm on the internet and

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,950
they're so excited and we love those

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,010
clients because I could build I mean I

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,120
never build a crappy website on purpose

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,610
on occasion I may have done it

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,900
accidentally but uh you know I you can

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,000
build any almost any site and they're

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,650
just so super thrilled with it I love

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,270
those customers they ask you how like

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,070
how they they spell your name for the

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,260
check and hand it to you before you give

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,790
them built the website then we have

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,920
those customers on the other end of the

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,570
spectrum who say to us well I could

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,430
basically do this for myself but I just

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,170
don't have the time and I'm thinking to

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,270
myself well I don't I'm not an

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,770
accountant you're an accountant you know

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,630
so you want me to build you a website

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,280
that for an accountant I don't do

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,740
accounting I specialize in what I

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,940
specialize in I admit that I don't do

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,020
accounting you could look at my bank

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,140
account and know that I don't to

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,840
accounting but they should be able to

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,820
say - I am hiring you because I want

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,340
somebody who specializes and what you

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,690
specialize in not because I don't have

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,740
the time to do it so those are the

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,720
people though that we have to be a

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,880
little more wary of because they're

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,400
going to nitpick every single little

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,230
thing then there's the customers in the

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,540
middle in that sweet spot who are

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,250
teachable who want to learn who

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,300
understand basically what they want they

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,830
know a little bit more about their

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,270
customers that can have a little more

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,160
input in the design that can actually

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,050
send you content that you don't have to

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,760
write for them and they could really

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,350
kind of direct you and then maybe they

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,200
want to do some things on their site to

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,510
like write a blog post upload photos

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,190
things like that those are the people

00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,290
that we can really empower to use their

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,370
websites the right way because they have

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,600
the right heart in it they have the

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,380
right attitude approaching it and

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,730
they're teachable but it does take a

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,650
little finesse because it is a little

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,660
bit like herding cats to get them to

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,790
understand what it is that we're gonna

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,040
teach them so today we're going to talk

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,840
about what is the appropriate user level

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,060
how to make them listen to us how to

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,250
give them instructions the layers of

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,370
learning that are necessary finding good

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,860
resources proper warnings user manual

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,500
and FAQ good plugins and then how you

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,020
charge to fix it once they break it

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,940
because they will break it so what's an

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,440
appropriate loot user level so what do

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,010
they want to be able to do what do they

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,979
need to be able to do will you still be

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,949
involved so is it one of those things

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,360
where you sell the site you hand it over

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,460
they delete your user name and you're

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,350
done right or are they going to be

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,320
keeping you on somehow whether it's

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,090
under a contract whether it's like call

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,600
me if you need me or you're gonna be

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,790
maintaining their site ongoing and then

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,740
who in the organization needs access to

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,950
be able to do what they is that they

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,600
want to accomplish so when I say that

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,830
the reason I'm asking that is do we

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,010
really want to give them admin access if

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,690
I'm building a site I'm handing it off

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,310
to them they have their own hosting they

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,110
don't want to they don't want to buy my

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,430
maintenance programs they don't want to

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,070
do anything if they need me they'll pay

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,360
me an hourly fee then I'm probably not

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,520
gonna keep they're probably gonna delete

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,650
my admin access so somebody else has to

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,930
have admin access to the site so

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,849
regardless of how good they can manage

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,639
their own website they have to be given

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,110
an admin account don't ever make it

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,990
admin you know that right like make it

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,590
an actual name not admin password 1 2 3

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,389
because that's what they'll do you

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,160
actually have to make sure you tell them

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,240
that so that when they create of user

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,840
accounts but it should be something

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,090
people can't guess how to use but what

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,490
is their level of want and then what is

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,210
their level of need so if they say I

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,700
want to be able to do everything let

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,200
them define what everything means do

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,530
they actually want to be able to change

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,599
themes do they actually want to be able

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,860
to upload plugins do they want to do

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,050
their own updates so they want to update

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,820
plugins and themes on their site or do

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,210
they really just want to write a blog

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,010
post add an image or to change the phone

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,050
number be able to say they're not that

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,550
they're closed on Saturday those are the

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,830
things we have to ask to get down to the

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,450
nitty-gritty of what do they actually

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,520
need when they tell you what they want

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,919
because

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,770
they could mess things up right I mean I

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,830
can't tell you when I but when I when I

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,960
first got into WordPress a friend and I

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,690
started a nonprofit organization in

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,129
Rochester New York that's where I'm from

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,229
and her we said to her husband who built

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,780
websites you need to build us a website

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,259
for this nonprofit and he said no

00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,639
problem

00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,169
I'll build to build the website we were

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,690
like yeah we're getting a website for

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,069
free so he builds the infrastructure he

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,509
sends those logins he's like okay I

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,780
built it but you have to populate it

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,979
we're like wait a minute what I don't

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,039
I'm what you know and so I logged in and

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,840
I was afraid to click anything and it

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,680
was my first WordPress site ever logging

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,810
in I was pretty much terrified to touch

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,000
anything because I thought anything I

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,620
did could break this site could delete

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,599
things that should be deleted now of

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,300
course I know now WordPress is much more

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,979
robust than that it's easier to fix that

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,110
I thought it might be easier to fix if I

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,479
deleted a page for example oh look

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,050
there's the trash I can undelete it but

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,340
at the time I was terrified

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,080
unfortunately I had to get over that

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,060
fear cuz we weren't gonna send him text

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,409
and have him populated into the site he

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,380
wasn't interested in doing that for us

00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:52,180
and this was back before mobile at all

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,520
so we didn't even have smartphones so

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,229
like that luckily the site doesn't exist

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,909
anymore or you'd start pulling it up on

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,250
your phone and be like why are we

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:03,310
listening to her she does leave a

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,870
designer mall but at the time I started

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,110
playing around with it I started adding

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,840
pages we started blogging and putting

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,610
posts out there I uploaded images that

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,020
way to higher resolution I might add

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,529
then I learned how that meant and to

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,979
redo that oh it doesn't need to be 5,000

00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:24,310
pixels wide at 300 dpi another thing to

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,690
teach your clients by the way and so we

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,400
started to learn what that meant to use

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,440
WordPress and that's how I learned that

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,289
if I could be trusted with a website

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,659
knowing nothing at the time I could

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,300
certainly teach other people how to use

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,529
it in a way that they can understand

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,810
that they can use their website without

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,219
breaking it however that doesn't mean

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,829
that they can't break it if they poke

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,649
around in too many places because if

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:50,500
you're you let's say you're using a a

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,420
site builder like Divi or

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,190
you know our beaver builder or anything

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,370
and they go in and they decide they want

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,470
to play around with what other what

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,270
other editors or other themes might look

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,770
like they're gonna click the raw a

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,820
different theme and suddenly it's not

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,500
going to look anything like they

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,150
expected it to and now all panic is

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,250
gonna end soo and it's gonna be at

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,240
Friday at Friday night at 7 o'clock at

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,620
night and you're gonna be starting to

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,910
get those phone calls so you want to

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,860
make sure that you're giving them access

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:19,240
to what they actually had access to and

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,370
then you need to make them listen so you

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,840
you if they say somebody here needs

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,050
admin access that's fine

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,110
but listen to me and listen to me well

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,650
because you need to understand where the

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:36,100
limits are so it's not easy to break a

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,590
website but it happens who here has

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,430
never ever on a website they dealt with

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:44,460
seeing the white screen of death couple

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:51,220
people that's great because guess what

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:53,860
it exists I redeployed a site that I

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,050
built years ago Amanda and I are working

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,550
on a new site soon and I thought oh this

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,080
is really similar to when I built before

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,060
so I don't have to start from scratch

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,580
I'll just redeploy the site from 3 years

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,780
ago so I did and it was white screen

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,930
right for the beginning and I was like

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,400
well all this isn't good

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,550
luckily I could log in and once I

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,590
updated my plugins and my theme and oh

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,820
yeah WordPress it works like it was

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,610
supposed to again which was wonderful

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,470
but the first thing it was I was like so

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,090
of course before I started playing with

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,440
it I deleted the whole thing and

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,600
uploaded it again because I figure maybe

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,340
I used the wrong backup of course it did

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,320
the exact same thing so you you know

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,450
like do the same thing get the same

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,980
response as the office is what insanity

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,460
is I've had a little moment of insanity

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,900
but I made it work because I thought I

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,030
can be smarter than this and I can

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,290
figure it out put your customers don't

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,730
know how to be smarter than that and

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,290
figure it out and so you are the person

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,760
getting the phone call and if you don't

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,660
turn off your phone you're going to be

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,220
the one getting the phone call when

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,260
they're playing with it after they get

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,520
done at work which is could be 9 10 11

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,260
o'clock at night if they're also

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,410
entrepreneurs so make sure they

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,670
understand that it is possible I'm not

00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,080
going to break it by putting in a new

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,330
phone number they're not going to break

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,650
it by changing the hours on in the

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,210
footer but that if they start playing

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,580
around with

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,180
and changing themes that things could go

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,940
south very quickly so explain what areas

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,350
they should be involved in they can take

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,390
and play with pages they can play with

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,580
posts they can upload media that's

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,589
fantastic let them have that experience

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,000
empower them to do those things but then

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,330
also explain what areas they should

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,490
consider off-limits it used to be that

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:32,589
there was no warning on the theme editor

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,630
so you'd go to the theme editor page and

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,250
it didn't say whoa are you sure you want

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,500
to do that and you would have to click a

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,209
box we do that now right so now if I go

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,980
there I know what I'm doing I'm just

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,320
looking for code I'm not changing code

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,000
but it'll it'll give you that warning

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,310
like iron you know kind of like preceded

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,810
caution kind of like you know Dorothy

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,670
and wandering down the road it's like

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,910
you're getting in some bad air yeah you

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,170
sure you want to do that and so we know

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,160
that we can yeah I'm doing that I'm just

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,140
gonna copy some code I'm not gonna

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,899
delete anything but your customers might

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:08,290
be like huh I wonder what that semicolon

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:10,779
does that there's too many there I'm

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,610
just gonna delete that one oh man my

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,620
whole site's down where did I take that

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,070
semicolon from well I'll just put it

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,860
back over here needle in a haystack

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,300
right so what am i doing so we need to

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,339
make sure they understand what areas

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,700
should be off-limits whether they have

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,680
access to it or not when all else fails

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,320
remember that money talks what is my

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,810
hourly rate this is my hourly rate what

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,910
is my rate to fix a site that you messed

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,000
up and broke up it's my hourly rate

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,980
times three because I want them to

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,690
understand there is gravity to this but

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,459
if they break a site after I've given

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,020
them all the warnings I've given them

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,690
every way that they could possibly not

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,370
break it I'm really gonna charge them up

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,579
the wazoo I don't know what a while Zoo

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,620
is but I love that phrase up the wazoo

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,790
to fix their website I can guess what it

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,610
was do is but we're not going to go into

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,500
that right now so remember that fixing

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,130
their problems cost a lot of money and

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,630
when you talk dollars and cents to your

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,300
customers especially if they're

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,550
entrepreneurs that talks louder than any

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,810
warning you could have ever say so make

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,740
sure they understand that it's gonna

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,770
cost you then you can take the point of

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,330
instruction now if you're going to build

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,810
a site and you understand that this is

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,370
the end goal build it into the contract

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,990
make sure you're getting paid for the

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,940
time that you're sitting down to do

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,040
instruction for them I'm not saying any

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,030
of this should come free

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,800
none of this should come free it should

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,780
all be built into that price or an

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,690
add-on price that if I am turning over

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,760
your website to you and I am not

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,710
maintaining it and you want me to teach

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,840
you how to use it it will cost you X

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,700
number of dollars because my time is not

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,250
free

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,800
so when I sit down with a customer the

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,420
cellphones go away the email goes away

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,470
they have to give me their undivided

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,990
attention because I'm only doing this

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,000
once I'm not going to do this over and

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,860
over and over again and I recommend two

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,290
to three sessions to actually teach them

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,060
everything because when you can layer it

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,030
like that I think that's coming up maybe

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,320
in the next slide then it's easier to

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,520
retain information rather than saying

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,930
we're gonna have eight hours I'm gonna

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,880
dump it all on you and then i'm peacing

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,810
out right you don't want to do that you

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,220
want to make sure that they can

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,380
internalize the information that they

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,270
understand that you're working with them

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,860
that you see them edit a page you see

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,530
them edit a post they're writing down

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,820
notes they're you know doing screencast

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,280
whatever it is so that they have

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,490
something to go back to later to reflect

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,100
on again only instruct them on what they

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,960
need to know don't tell them and if you

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,700
want to copy anything out of the theme

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,740
editor because they don't need to do

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,330
that right so make sure that you're not

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,160
showing them every single Bell and

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,080
whistle that WordPress does you're not

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,510
teaching them to design you're teaching

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,520
them how to use their own website and

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,350
then again answer their questions but

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,120
what the appropriate honesty so what if

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,500
I go here well you can look at that but

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,810
again I wouldn't make a lot of changes

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,810
there oh you forgot you know it says

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,330
here that we're in the Cupertino

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:08,080
timezone I don't know Cupertino is like

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,640
what in California yeah but but I or

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,200
it's Greenwich Mean it whatever I don't

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,610
remember what that default is and but

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,070
we're actually in New York or we're in

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,240
Toronto or wherever and can we change

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,620
that well yeah you can change that

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,780
that's not gonna I mean it's going to

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,810
affect if you're setting blog posts to

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,240
to auto turn on at some point right to

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,530
auto publish so it's gonna affect that

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,240
time frame because that's when they're

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,890
going to actually publish when you sent

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,020
something to the future but it's not

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,550
gonna break the world right

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,750
not gonna take the site down etc so

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,000
there are some things that they can look

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,500
at some things you don't recommend you

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
know for example if they decide they

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,320
don't want to be HTTP anymore and they

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,850
just take those SS out of the settings

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,100
not a good idea so there are things that

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,860
they should they should you know have a

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,860
healthy respect for yes

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,779
we're getting there I promise

00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:05,399
okay yep so as I say there's layers of

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,749
learning so we're gonna talk about we're

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,879
gonna set up two to three meetings and

00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:11,610
we're gonna teach them how to use it

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,329
because some dot two dots you can't tell

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,009
what it is

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,199
before you start to connect the dots

00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,790
right I have no idea what that is I

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,439
found it on the internet and it was so

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,649
horrifying it looks like a spider web

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,509
and I don't know that I thought who

00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,649
knows what that's supposed to be that's

00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,749
what it feels like to a customer

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,100
sometimes right you turn them back to

00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,199
and loose on the back end you have to

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,149
help them connect those dots so every

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,589
time you sit down with them reiterate

00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,999
this is what we learned last week and

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,610
this is how we're gonna build on it this

00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,990
week or whatever the next meeting is so

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,730
layer that learning so that they have a

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,300
better opportunity to internalize it and

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,949
understand what you're doing and then

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,929
find some good resources for them that

00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,129
you don't have to be the answer to every

00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:52,559
single question they don't have to be

00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,749
calling you every day or emailing you or

00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,059
chatting you or I don't know when I

00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:59,490
started out I did everything wrong in my

00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,139
freelance business I had seven different

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,929
ways that customers would contact me

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,789
through every means Twitter Facebook

00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:08,640
text messaging phone calling emailing I

00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:10,169
mean you name it I was having people you

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,669
know messaging me in in so many

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:13,829
different ways that I could hardly keep

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,360
track of all the different areas so make

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,699
sure that they have other resources

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,529
besides always reaching out to you and

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,140
there's a good list of resources that I

00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:24,240
found that had that are really good for

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,490
learning WordPress so if they want to

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,350
know how to make the color different in

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,320
an area that doesn't have a quick easy

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,909
color changer w3schools is a fast and

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,070
easy way because there's even a way that

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,929
you can test it on their website so give

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,130
them some resources that they can

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:42,570
actually use wpbeginner.com it's great

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,220
if they want to add a plug-in at some

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,049
point and they don't want to ask you to

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,720
do it there's a really great way that

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,850
tells you if it's not in the repository

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,740
if it's a paid plug-in they don't know

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,390
how to just Auto install it through the

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,399
website so they have to know to download

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,340
it from where they bought it uploaded in

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,140
and w wpbeginner has a great way to

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,809
teach them how to do that I send

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,429
customers there all the time in my day

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,470
job to be able to tell them how to

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:11,760
upload our plugins into their website

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,410
then there's lynda.com udemy and wp101

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,390
comm has another great way of teaching

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,980
people how to use WordPress again I

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,050
can't stress it enough you really do

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,660
need to tell them give them the serious

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,250
warnings there are warnings it's like I

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,650
don't know if you I'm a game of Thrones

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,450
person first I will admit that I never

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,070
watched it until two months ago and then

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,870
i banished the entire first seven

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,250
seasons in two weeks so that I could

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,080
catch up with my co-workers so we're

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,190
talking about it all the time to watch

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,010
it till the end and now I'm like

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:45,390
dreaming of White Walkers and okay

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,390
really I dream of Jon Snow who's kidding

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,400
but realistically like when Sam Samwell

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,170
was like and the the white Walker looked

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,270
at him and Sam was like oh man this is

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,100
my dying day he was lucky it didn't

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,570
happen that way this is what we're

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,180
thinking of us like this could be the

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,220
bad time you don't want to do that so be

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,580
clear in what you mean when you give

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,550
them those those warnings provide the

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,780
why and tell them what if it's not just

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,400
a don't go the remember wouldn't you

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,020
have children or if you ever have work

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,790
but you were a child everybody was and

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,160
you weren't supposed to touch the stove

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,140
because it's hot a two-year-old doesn't

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,730
really understand what hot means so you

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,550
have to explain it in a way that it

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,490
makes sense not just don't do because

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:30,280
tell me don't do something I'm kind of

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,170
tempted to figure out why and maybe I'm

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,790
gonna do it anyway and I'm gonna figure

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,750
out why I shouldn't have the wrong way

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,670
because nobody told me that the

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,370
consequences are so find out the way I

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,950
tell them what happens if and hackers

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,490
and errors and white screens oh my right

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,550
so I made the mistake a couple years

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:51,040
about about two years ago when I was up

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,320
in I headed to Montreal for word camp

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,820
Montreal and I started getting all these

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,810
phone calls from my customers that their

00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:01,450
sites were down and I was like oh boy

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:03,430
and I had I was using shared hosting and

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,090
I had about 13 different sites in the

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,040
same shared hosting area and I found out

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,230
when I got to where I was going I pulled

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,070
up my email and I had an email from my

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,970
host saying there was a virus or a hack

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,580
of some kind

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,370
had compromised my area and there were

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:25,010
over 900 infected files

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,230
and I had to clean them all up so I went

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,500
to the speaker dinner and went back to

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,750
my hotel I spent the entire night

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,210
cleaning up files re deploying header

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,600
files redeploying footer files tear

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:41,690
taking out the files that were injected

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,540
into these and I thought man thank God I

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:48,110
got it all done sycron said it's all

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,820
clear everything's good well I had said

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,220
just the week before to my Meetup I

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,750
really want to have a meetup session

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220
where we talk about what to do if you've

00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:01,340
been hacked does anybody want to lead

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:04,160
that cuz I've never been hacked be

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,740
careful what you ask for because by

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,720
Monday I was hacked again and I had 1200

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,780
files I had to clean up and I cleaned

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,550
them all up and I was happy and I

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,140
realized between the first time or the

00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,810
second time that I never checked to see

00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,010
if they had made admin accounts because

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,510
nobody told me that they could make

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,910
admin accounts I didn't think about it

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,820
so all these 13 sites I cleaned up still

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:28,820
had advent accounts that weren't me or

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,100
the customer and all those reinfection

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,830
happen so I cleaned out all the

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,400
infection I deleted all those user

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,660
accounts wipe my brow woke up the next

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,700
day and they were all infected again

00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,280
because I still hadn't found the source

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,410
of the infection by the way that CGI bin

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,350
that gets in like put in every single

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,570
website and is always empty delete that

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,730
sucker because that's where they cuz

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,020
nobody thinks to look there and that's

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,270
where it was once I got it out of the

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,030
CGI but I wasn't better off anyway so

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,250
hackers errors white screens

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,900
oh my because you know you the easiest

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,730
way to get a white screen is to update a

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,980
plug-in that you didn't test first one

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,500
by one just update oh there's 16 updates

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,870
today I'm just gonna update them all I

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,400
wonder which one broke it right so

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,680
there's there's ways to teach them how

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,270
to do that one by one as we know and

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,850
then see what happens and then if we

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:23,660
need to we can always you know go back

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:27,380
to whatever create a user manual what a

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,090
fast fun fascinating that fast

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,350
fascinating idea create a user manual

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,840
for your customer make it digital

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,700
digital digits whole yet printable

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,559
because we all know if they are

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,840
chocolates they are going to print it

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:45,049
anyway so make it something that's a PDF

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,909
or lives in you know Google Docs or

00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,080
something where there's clickable links

00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,240
but they can print it off because

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,429
they'll want to print it off but make

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,350
sure you branded it because it's your

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,179
intellectual property so put that

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,950
branding all over the front and your

00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,690
footers put the link back to your

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,659
website you know put the phone number

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,970
and then as I say on the last page

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,330
include your emergency pricing to remind

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:11,330
them that you were serious about that

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,679
because you were serious about that but

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,240
include in there you know how to run a

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,070
backup first right so there should

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,570
always have backup software they should

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,570
be your backup software should be

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,640
working but I always before I update any

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,990
plug-in or theme write a backup even if

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,970
a backup just happened last night

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,130
I run a backup download it to my to my

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,230
hard drive delete it afterwards as long

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,029
as everything's fine but I always have

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,740
that right at the ready where I can get

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,559
at it quickly and redeploy a site so she

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,360
teach them how to do that teach him how

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,820
to use pages and posts how to add them

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,940
how to edit them how to add media teach

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,370
them how to be accessible not just add a

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,010
photo but why do we use alt tags and

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,080
what are they for and remind them that

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,779
not everybody that comes to their site

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,370
is the same has the same ability as

00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:59,120
everybody else that comes to their site

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,570
teach them good net citizenship so that

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,659
they add things to the website that keep

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,860
it accessible for everybody

00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,659
include links to your references so if

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,179
you're referencing lynda.com if you're

00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,559
referencing at udemy course keep that

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,630
and put that in there so they understand

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,190
how to find it and then as I said make

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,720
sure you include your murder emergency

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:22,130
pricing create a quick easy guide so

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,260
they don't necessarily have to find

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,640
everything in a big manual maybe even

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,020
laminate it for them and really blow

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,419
their minds

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,659
you know the first thing on every list I

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:35,690
always tell everybody don't panic

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:38,480
anything is recoverable to a degree but

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,279
with a website with backups everything

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,820
is recoverable we can fix it right we

00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,320
can fix it what did the teach of what

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,940
the different plugins do that that

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,000
you've installed on their site so maybe

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,980
you maybe they're a non-profit and

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,170
you've got donor software a donor

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,520
plug-in on their website teach them what

00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,050
that does and how to do it so if they

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,280
have to make another donation form they

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,290
understand how to do that

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,930
you know if they are if you're using a

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,790
plugin that's SEO make sure they

00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,120
understand how they create a fill out

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:10,340
that form on each page or post so that

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,960
the SEO is working on those pages teach

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,810
them those things and put that in that

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,280
handy FAQ teach them put in there the

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,280
basic editing how to save it how to

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,260
update it the basic SEO steps how to

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,990
back out their site put that on that

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,530
that handy-dandy chart - so whether

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,460
using backup buddy are using I can't

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,220
think of the other ones also go ahead

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,270
duplicator up Josh plus that's the one I

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,220
was trying to member or you're using

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,230
duplicator any of the free ones any of

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,380
the paid ones teach them how to how to

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,390
do it in what it means the importance of

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,940
why you would need to update them and

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,920
then page in post revisions so teach

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,020
them how you create a post but then

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,180
teach them how to go back to an earlier

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,520
revision because if they publish it and

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,470
they messed it up what they wanted on

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,330
the page they're gonna panic that they

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,190
lost the information that they wanted

00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,390
and we all know it's still there because

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,310
all you have to do is go back to the

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,290
previous revision and it's still right

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,120
there so teach them how to do this so

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,050
they don't panic and then I have to call

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,160
you at 2:00 in the morning when they

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,210
finally get around to editing their

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,310
website plugins this is my favorite meme

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,930
on the whole thing

00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,470
nice WordPress site we got there it'll

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,850
be a shame if something happened to it

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,450
so there are plugins for user role

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:27,140
management you can create a user role

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,240
management that's it's incremental in

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,950
what people are able to do or not able

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,860
to do so you can get down to some

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,200
granularity as far as what people have

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,820
access to so they can have access to

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,310
some admin features but not all I've

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,320
been features they can have editor roles

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,350
they can have you know you can really

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,570
change around and plugins to write so a

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,960
plug-in that's a donor plug-in that I

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,140
happen to be really close to it has user

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,030
roles so that somebody could create

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,950
forms but not see the donor information

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,660
because that might be more confidential

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,760
so there are different roles and

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,020
different levels of management that you

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,980
can give as far as user

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:09,140
usability a backup plug-in whichever one

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,140
you use make sure it's automated don't

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,420
count on them running a backup and don't

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,070
count on your hosts or their hosts to

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,990
always be at the ready with the backup

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,450
either because I've had problems with

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,300
that in the past if you if your host has

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,040
a 30-day you know they they backup for

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,070
30 days and then they drop that 30th one

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,260
I had a customer whose site got infected

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,020
I didn't build the site but I had to fix

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,300
the site it got infected I was able to

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,640
go to their host and get that 30-day

00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,130
backup guess what it was still infected

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,070
because it was a sleeper and it deployed

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:46,280
after 30 days so you have to be really

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,920
cautious about that WP rollback is your

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,780
friend WP rollback is my company makes

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,170
it it's a free plugin it's in the

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,370
repository WP rollback will it gives you

00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,800
different levels of being able to

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,590
rollback what's going on on your website

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,930
so if somebody updates a plug-in and the

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,790
plug-in causes all kinds of problems

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,130
that's integrating with other plugins

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,300
you can click WP rollback and it just

00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,220
takes it back to the previous

00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,420
installation so you don't have to look

00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,160
for a previous one you don't have to

00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,990
figure out how to install that it will

00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,360
roll back that plug-in or theme for you

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,850
so that you can look into how to fix it

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,010
and or have your developers how to know

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,330
how to fix the developer the plug-in so

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,220
that if there's plug-in conflicts those

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,900
things are easy to fix and so if your

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,700
customer updates something they

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,000
shouldn't have you can also use that WP

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,130
rollback to fix it quickly and then WP

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,980
101 I mentioned calm is a great way to

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,620
learn WordPress WP 101 is also a plug-in

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,420
that will give backend information on

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,360
what things do so it's kind of like a

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,010
road map for your back-end the WordPress

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,810
dashboard and it gives those little

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,760
question marks where they can hover and

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,430
see what different things do and gives

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,560
them some insights and it also has video

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:56,960
on the that goes on to your website well

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,250
the video links on the website to

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
understand how to do things so it's kind

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:05,000
of like a little mini course right

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,740
within the dashboard and charge

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,540
appropriately is Pyxis I made this meme

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,040
today I was very proud of it there are

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,230
no client mistakes only happy little

00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,899
opportunities to make money

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,350
I had to make it twice because I was so

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:20,600
tired I spelled there wrong but make a

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,919
contract make sure that they sign it and

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,090
they understand how much they're going

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,519
to be paying you to fix it

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,019
that contract should have an end so that

00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,730
after a year if you've raised your

00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,500
prices they have to understand they're

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,600
going to be paying even more it's not

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,110
you know forever and ever this is my

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,049
price

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,690
don't take pity on them I don't care if

00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:40,730
it's your church if they've messed it up

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,000
and they're impacting your life maybe

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:46,210
okay your church buy because you

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,889
probably built it for free anyway

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,269
but you know it could be like the

00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,029
grandma down the road with our own

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,830
little yarn shop right but if she messed

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:56,630
it up it doesn't mean that your time is

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,370
free your time is still but your time is

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,820
so if she signed the contract if you

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:03,110
have to fix it you charge to fix it

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,549
remember it's not your emergency it's

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,080
their emergency Oh your site's down

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:12,110
that's really what a shame Amy because

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,029
it needs to be fixed their mistakes are

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,010
your next night out Oh somebody made a

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:20,600
mistake well we're gonna eat well next

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,919
week a dinner and a movie and as I said

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,539
charge two to three times your normal

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,360
rate because it's uh it's never at an

00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:28,190
opportune time you have a schedule that

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,419
you're trying to go with with what

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,519
you're designing and your maintenance

00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:34,399
and everything else so somebody else's

00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,049
problem adds to your already scheduled

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,669
week which means you're working more

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:43,010
hours than you anticipate it and you

00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:44,630
need to be remunerated for that the

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,730
mission is not impossible it's just a

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,799
really easy to make sure that you're

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,630
empowering these customers make sure

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,250
that they understand the gravity of the

00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,500
situation and make sure that you're

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,409
using the plugins that will limit what

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,789
they access limit or give them the

00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,100
backups that you need should they have

00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,659
problems and provide them the tools that

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,830
they need to make sure that their site

00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:10,389
is continues to be operational I'm

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,389

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,160
and yeah that's all so questions I want

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:49,930
to answer your questions and I'm gonna

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:52,950
have fun answering questions janta tell

00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,720
a story of the worst client I ever had

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:59,800
absolutely I'm trying to decide which

00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,990
fun okay I'm gonna go with this

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,420
particular one so I had a client who's

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,880
an artist and he's a metal artist so he

00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,670
uses blow torches and big welders and

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,830
all these wonderful and he makes

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:14,440
incredibly beautiful sculptural garden

00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:18,460
pieces and just amazing beautiful work

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,800
and so he said to me I would like a site

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,990
that's very similar to this other site

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,910
and it was another artist and it was

00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,520
ethereal the site was beautiful a lot of

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:29,710
white space a lot of garden a lot of

00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,360
beauty and I thought he's I want it to

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,620
be just like that well I'm not gonna

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,920
make it just like that because I'm not a

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,950
thief but I can take the aesthetic and I

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,530
can recreate the aesthetic so I spent a

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,520
ton of time I mean I did I did my due

00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,080
diligence I asked him all the questions

00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,400
I spent a lot of time with him you know

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,250
discovering what he liked what he didn't

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,290
like I spent a lot of time with it so I

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,810
took a lot of time to create the site

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,550
and I thought it was beautiful it was

00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,290
lovely it was this aerial it was all the

00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,970
things that you would expect with garden

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,180
fairies and all of these sculptural

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,360
pieces very excited that I go sit down

00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,770
with him I show him the site well I was

00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,810
thinking maybe the background should be

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,760
black and instead of the really pretty I

00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,040
want like something with sparks flying

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,960
and I want pages about my motorcycles

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,460
and I want another page about how I used

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,160
to be an Arby's

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,110
you know owner and all of a sudden the

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,640
site went from I want it just like this

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,660
to nothing like the Hat and I said

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,950
okay well I mean I could change

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,760
backgrounds I can do these things right

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:33,550
so I basically redesigned the site and I

00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,370
showed it to him and he's like this is

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,750
it I love this this is fantastic I said

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,910
great I'm so glad I found something you

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,950
like the next thing he calls me up he's

00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:45,370
like I don't like the way it looks on my

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,230
phone I said what do you mean he said I

00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,660
like the way it looks on my laptop I

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:52,690
wanted to look exactly like that on my

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,600
phone I said okay so you want the word

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,620
so small that nobody can read them what

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,120
do you mean I said well they'll have to

00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,400
pinch open to be able to read the

00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,780
navigation if it's not mobile responsive

00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,630
yes that's exactly what I want

00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,220
I said well to be quite honest I'm not

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,679
sure exactly how to do that because it's

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,600
really only designed for mobile and I

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,570
did use you know Divi and it's a mobile

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,429
responsive but I you know so give me you

00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,120
know 24-48 hours to figure out if that's

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,450
even possible

00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,340
in the meantime I'm going oh my god I go

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,720
online I post in the Divi user group how

00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,850
can I do this and of course it was like

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,250
I was like the proverbial eggs like

00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,860
don't be because why would you do that

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,020
don't do that Tommy is stupid right I

00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,580
mean I was like well but you could do

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,429
this with you could do this to turn the

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,899
responsiveness off the next day I get

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,460
another text from he's like well my

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:42,240
friend said I'm being an idiot so just

00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,010
leave it the way it is and I was like

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,290
that was one of my worst clients because

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:51,700
every step of the way it was just like

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:53,380
this nothing like this yeah and he would

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,780
never have a login to his on site

00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,040
because he would break it

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,040
he wasn't interest in that yes

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,450
it depends on the customer so if it's a

00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,460
customer that I had difficulty getting

00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:16,100
payment from in the beginning right so

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,480
the question was she's reminding me that

00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,610
everybody can hear everybody the

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,380
question was if they are have broken

00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,940
their site and you have a contract do

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,320
you build them up front before you fix

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,910
it or after you fixed it

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,400
so it kind of depends on the customer if

00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,890
it's a customer that I know pays well as

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,600
in pace quickly and I don't have to hum

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,890
them for money then I would wait because

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,290
I really don't necessarily know how long

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,110
it's gonna take me to fix it if it's a

00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:40,670
customer that has been problematic in

00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,370
the past I probably would already have

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,570
them on a retainer so that if if I would

00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,160
be taking money off what I've already

00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,150
paid me because I don't want to not get

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,000
paid for the work that I do especially

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:58,820
in an emergency situation so more

00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,140
questions yes I'm so glad you asked

00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,850
because I don't remember off the top of

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,080
my head

00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,640
can I get back to you I'll tweet it out

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,020
I promise I will tweet it out later

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,360
because I just overcome recall what the

00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,700
title is so just follow me at Micheline

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:15,770
and I look sweet that out for you why do

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:17,180
I follow I'll follow you back to you

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,090
spoken for prior to me didn't you

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:24,290
awesome did we cover the same

00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:29,330
information a little bit synergy man

00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:31,780
it's a good thing right I know where

00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:36,830
Delta knows exactly what they're doing

00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:38,270
other questions I would say I love what

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,010
I'm so good that everybody's like now

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,070
I'm good you Nevada it's the end of the

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,910
day they're like just shut up we want to

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,910
party so

00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:03,720
they didn't when I was hacked what

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:06,270
happened is they they somehow hacked in

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,970
well I had a customer who I was just

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,890
hosting and I hadn't built his site he

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,870
never did any updates and so I think he

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,820
was patient zero because I think that

00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,800
somehow the because I was keeping

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,200
everything else updated so I think that

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,570
at some point some there was a security

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,120
breach in his site which then breached

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:28,260
into all these other sites and what it

00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:31,560
did is it deposited the the hack of a

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,840
virus whatever and in that CGI bin and

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,700
then when it deployed out to all of

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,340
these other sites it just created admin

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,470
accounts that were just like

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,060
gobbledygook email addresses like it

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,740
wasn't like a name it wasn't like hey

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,480
Bradley just has a new admin kind of

00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,280
thing and it never emailed me that those

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,730
had been created either that would have

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,940
been some kind of a sign like oh wait a

00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,200
minute you know X Y seven nine seven has

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,540
a user name that doesn't make any sense

00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,690
right so it's somehow it creates all

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,360
those yeah yeah yeah so it was

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,160
interesting I got really good at

00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,990
cleaning up files cuz I don't ever

00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,310
thirteen website I don't want to pay

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:18,450
security to fix them all but it makes

00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:20,700
sense a yes well so the problem is that

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,960
half of the customers that were in there

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,820
were also blogging and I wasn't sure how

00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,960
recently they had added to their sites

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,920
so I probably could have but I didn't

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
that probably would I'm a good way to do

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,030
it if ever been one then what if I had

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,950
partitioned off and I had sites on their

00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:44,090
own hosts which is the way I do things

00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,090
now I would have done exactly that yes

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,630
it is not necessary correct yep it's

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:02,420
it's kind of a hang a holdover from

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:08,750
older design times yeah yeah it's not

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:19,360
necessary yeah yeah yeah WordPress does

00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:21,320
not use it yeah so any other questions

00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,610
well thank you for being here I think

00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,570
I'd so nice to have so many people in

00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,080
the room at the end of the day I really

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,080
