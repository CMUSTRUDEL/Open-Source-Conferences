Title: Shanta R. Nathwani (TantienHime): Gutenberg Templates, CPT’s and ACF’s
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	In our last episode, dear campers, we learned about Custom Post Types (CPT’s) and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF’s) and why we need them. We had everything clear, right? Enter Gutenberg…
Until Gutenberg, we had to copy over content from one old post to the new. The other option is to use CPT’s and ACF’s. What’s the difference? When should you use one or the other… or BOTH?
In this session, we’ll take a quick review of CPT’s and ACF’s, then compare them to Gutenberg Blocks and Templates, and discuss when you should use each and why.

thanks to no

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,520
[Applause]

00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,690
good at good morning everybody I was

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,380
about to say afternoon we're almost

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,480
there

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,640
session before lunch I thank you all for

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,140
coming and thank you for coming to this

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,770
talk I had no idea I was going to have

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,289
this many people so I want at least

00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,940
preface this by saying that if how many

00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:31,689
of you have almost never touched

00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:34,150
WordPress in your lives no seriously I

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:36,879
will see hints okay all right that's

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,629
fine I wanted to make sure I'm talking

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:43,030
to the level of the room to give you an

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:46,089
idea this is not necessarily a beginner

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,400
talk but sometimes you will hear some of

00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,850
these terms and you want to know what

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,100
they are

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,129
so let me also say that this is an

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,549
advanced talk only because of the topic

00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,199
itself I am NOT going to show you code

00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,739
so if you want to see code this is not

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,440
the talk for you okay but what I want to

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:07,360
talk about today is the differences

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,220
between all of these things that you've

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,570
probably heard about how many of you

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,740
know what a CPT is okay but a little bit

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,700
more than half the room how many of you

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,159
know what a ACF is okay and how many of

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,770
you know the difference between an ACF

00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:30,159
and CPT's and guttenberg templates a

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,750
couple of hands okay all right this is

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,409
more or less what I would call an

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,210
opinion piece okay so let me at least

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,630
say that there are always going to be

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:43,659
differences of opinion I usually like

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,689
Juno said I tend to specialize in things

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,820
like information architecture how to

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:51,039
organize your menu how to organize your

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,740
content within your menu

00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:57,749
what are pages what are posts what kind

00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,789
of content belongs on these things

00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:04,719
that's what this talk is about it's

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:07,810
trying to decipher when you use one or

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,179
the other or do you use both I don't

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,130
know but I'm hoping today what I am

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,090
going to give you is information that

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,620
will allow you to make those decisions

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,659
okay you may not have the exact same

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,160
cases that I bring up but I'm gonna go

00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,580
through a couple

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,320
see where they fit this is still fairly

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,840
new for me so I thank you all for your

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,540
patience please feel free to ask

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,540
questions as I go through if you need

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,760
clarifications and by all means we'll

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:45,130
we'll get some questions even afterwards

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:47,290
if you need it okay so this is me I am

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,940
the Quality Assurance supervisor at

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,170
Weaver apps right here in Hamilton I am

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,890
happy to say that I've been there for

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,620
about a year now

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,510
and they've been extremely supportive of

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,880
me and my wordpress stuff even though we

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,200
don't do WordPress which is okay we used

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,720
to we used to do a lot of WordPress

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,610
before I got there I used to teach at

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,860
Sheridan College for about six years

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,170
doing web development and web design I

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,030
also taught at Mohawk College and help

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,360
develop their WordPress curriculum and

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,990
I'm a serial word camper I've lost count

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,330
I'm definitely over 30 and I've attended

00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,310
word camp Mumbai which is kind of a high

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,990
point for me I got to visit some family

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,910
and I've spoken at Los Angeles Chicago

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,220
Hamilton I've been an organizer now on

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,610
Hamilton's five word camps this is

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,450
number five for us and Toronto as well

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,760
as Milwaukee

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,750
I became an organizer in Milwaukee but

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,750
they're a great bunch of people too

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,489
okay so this is our agenda we're gonna

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,620
do a quick review of custom post types

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,629
and ACF's in the context of which we're

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,340
going to go forward in I'm going to do

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,230
an intro to Guttenberg blocks and

00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,549
templates again as it relates to this

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,049
topic I'm not going to show you every

00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,090
little block that goes through but I'm

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,700
going to show you some examples to give

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,170
you an idea of where we're going we're

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,370
gonna talk about a case say in real

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,040
estate how many of you were in my talk

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,890
last year on CPT's and ACF's okay so

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,299
this will look a bit familiar to you

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,370
because ivory borrowed it because it

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,979
still applies and now that we have

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,959
Guttenberg there's a whole new level to

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,630
this that we go oh my god so what does

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,570
this mean for CPT's and ACF's

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,100
right we're gonna talk about some of the

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,419
differences between them and then again

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,090
we're gonna take another look at a case

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,430
study of IMDB which is again something I

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:39,500
looked at last year but now I'm going to

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:42,770
apply the gutenberg stuff to it okay so

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,740
if you recall from last year a custom

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,610
post type can either act as a page or a

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,460
post in theory right it can act as

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,990
something that is more time-sensitive

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,090
right we all know the difference between

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,520
posts and pages and what belongs on them

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,150
because you've heard my talk on it I'm

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,970
sure so the idea is is that it can hold

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,300
static information it can hold dynamic

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,919
information more time-sensitive and it

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,250
can run like a blog or it can run Mike

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,440
static pages it can be organized by

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,200
categories and tags if you so wish it

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,300
you can also have your own what they

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,970
call it taxonomy does everybody remember

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,430
what a taxonomy is a taxonomy is

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,770
basically a system of organization so

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:33,020
categories and tags are taxonomy --zz

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,460
okay so you can have that those are

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,139
built into WordPress or you can do your

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,020
own and we're going to talk a little bit

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,340
about that when I show you the examples

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,039
and they will show up as different

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,710
entries on the dashboard when you

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,479
actually create a custom post type you

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,860
can actually now have it show up on the

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,410
dashboard and I have an example on the

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,450
next page and it can be called anywhere

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,240
into your site so you can have this show

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,160
up in the blog role as just a normal

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,380
post that shorter

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,220
you can have it in a separate area you

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,220
can have it wherever you like

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,130
so as I mentioned if you put it in as a

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,750
plug in the this is the example I'm

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,240
gonna use a bit later called listings

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,430
this is the custom post type so you

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,690
notice that you see posts you see pages

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,370
you see media and then you see listings

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,600
right which is our real estate example

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,060
that I'm going to show you so you can

00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,550
see now that I can actually add a new

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,560
listing just as if I was to add a new

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:40,160
page or new post right do we all

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,860
remember this now okay so here are some

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,340
examples of what might form a custom

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,210
post type any commerce product page such

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,740
as WooCommerce portfolio pages right

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,620
where you have a particular type of

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,419
portfolio you might want to have certain

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,230
pieces of information on it that don't

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:02,960
really fit into the regular template

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:08,810
author pages especially on a lot of news

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:11,270
sites you'll have a lot of custom post

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,800
types that show the authors or the

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,900
journalists that are actually writing

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,390
those posts and again the movie TV

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:22,700
series pages like on IMDB which I'm

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:26,240
going to show a little bit later okay so

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:29,030
in a standard WordPress post you have a

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
title and then you have basically your

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,690
body or your paragraph stuff and and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,169
media and so on the title itself is a

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:42,530
field write custom fields hope pieces of

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:45,530
that data that you want to show and in

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,190
the example we're gonna show an example

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:52,460
of a municipal address okay every

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,340
property that gets sold certainly in the

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,720
province of Ontario has to have a

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,220
municipal address attached to it so it's

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,710
a required field it's something you have

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,830
to put in it can be formatted it can be

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,990
stored right so that's an example it can

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,360
hold different types of data right so we

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,390
are talking about maybe it can hold a

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,860
currency or a number that is wrecking

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,800
nice in the database that can probably

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,930
use for calculation potentially right

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,540
which is not something that is normal

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,260
within a standard post right you have a

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,480
paint you have a title you have you know

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,640
the body itself but does the database

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,170
recognize that as a number not

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,790
necessarily so if you want to do things

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,480
like calculations you might need to do

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,370
something like this and again advanced

00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,530
custom fields I'll use them sort of

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,580
interchangeably but custom fields are

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,050
those fields that do not normally exist

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,410
advanced custom fields is actually a

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,490
plug-in and that I recommend using

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,740
because it's a fantastic plugin to use

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,130
and you don't have to code as much which

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,960
is kind of nice so this is the example I

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,540
actually showed last year and I'm going

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,790
to show again so this whole thing is a

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,060
listing which is a custom post type

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,370
right within that you have the different

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,220
fields you have a municipal address in

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,800
this case 1 2 3 Bayshore Drive who knows

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,700
where that is los angeles enter the

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,560
tonal total unit square footage so

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,750
that's an actual number I've told that

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:33,080
feel to be a number right main room size

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,680
and so on down down the line does that

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,380
make sense so far any questions about

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,060
that it used to be an instructor so I

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:47,220
have to do this right

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:50,639
okay so so how do I know which one is

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:55,320
which now we have custom post types and

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,480
we have advanced custom fields so what's

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,860
the difference now if I build a custom

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,810
post type that has all these lovely

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,380
fields in it or doesn't okay it's

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,389
possible that it doesn't they can work

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,850
independently but you know most people

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:13,079
use the the two together a custom field

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,079
answers the question what is this piece

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,620
of data in relation to the custom post

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,120
type or to the post or to whatever it is

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,459
what kind of data are you putting in

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,649
there like I said before are you putting

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,690
a currency are you putting a number are

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,180
you putting in address something that

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,519
can actually be recognized in a database

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,810
entry I know that sounds a little bit

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,389
technical for some in the room but

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,920
that's ultimately what it is if you were

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,430
to type a number into a regular

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,800
Guttenberg block does it recognize that

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,050
that's a currency does that something

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,500
that you can use to actually show

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,319
elsewhere or to do a search on as well

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,870
as you could if it was actually a custom

00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,880
field in and of itself and dealt with

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,220
for things like impossible calculations

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,839
does that make sense okay a custom post

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,980
type answered the question what is the

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,920
content or the layout now this is where

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,649
it kind of gets tricky because in goog

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,089
we have Gutenberg blocks which is

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,220
probably what you're most familiar with

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,050
we have paragraphs there are tons of

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,519
others that you can you can use you can

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,100
use galleries you can use all of these

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,500
things and then you have Gutenberg

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:30,920
templates how many of you have actually

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,660
used Gutenberg templates one person

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,519
interesting how many of you know what

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,110
they are I see five or six hands out of

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,810
this whole room that's interesting okay

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,250
so let me explain what I understand

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,769
because this is still new to me as well

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,350
so let's go with this Gutenberg

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,990
templates assume that you have built

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,080
will use the term page for sake of

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,000
simplicity you have built your page

00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,190
it may have a photo let's say of an

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,580
author you might use a custom post type

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:05,850
by the way it's possible and you've put

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:09,839
in all this data and everything else you

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:16,200
can actually save that with its content

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:19,110
as a Guttenberg template okay so if

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,839
you're going to reuse all of that

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,080
content remember that that because

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,300
that's going to come up later in a quiz

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,330
if you're gonna reuse the content over

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,190
and over and over and over again maybe

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,020
not all of it but even parts of it

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,750
sometimes it's the layout sometimes it's

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,110
the actual content itself you might save

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,430
that as a Guttenberg template and I'm

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,950
going to use some examples in just a

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,870
minute and then you can then say oh I

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,690
want to use that template and guess what

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,750
your content is already there which is

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,850
not what happens with a custom post type

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,760
with a custom post type and your

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,730
advanced custom fields let's say you

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,500
might have a default or one that shows

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,970
up automatically but it doesn't

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,220
necessarily show unless you put

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:08,339
something in it whereas with a custom

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,620
with the Guttenberg template you may

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,270
have created all of the information

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,420
let's say something at the bottom say

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,100
hey sign up for my thing over here you

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,500
may not want that on every page but you

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,029
may want to use it again and again

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,380
rather than going into the code and

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,140
editing it and putting it in the footer

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,459
somewhere make sense are there any

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,589
questions about that we're good we can

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:37,220
keep going all right let's see how he

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,220
goes go ahead

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:58,439
yes so the question was how can you use

00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:01,229
Gutenberg templates to apply to certain

00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:04,349
pages or to certain posts the answer is

00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:08,519
yes so rather than just selecting new

00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:09,959
page or a new post or add new I'm trying

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,579
to remember exactly on the menu itself

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,589
but you would basically save it as a

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,019
template whatever it is that you're

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,109
working on and then when you go back you

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,429
can actually start with a template I'm

00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,309
trying to remember exactly how you but

00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:25,079
it's there available to you so that when

00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,119
you start let's say again you have

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,970
something at the bottom of your page you

00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:32,099
may not want that on every blog post

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,089
right Matt and I were talking about this

00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:38,009
last night to give you an example let's

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:42,299
say for example you have two charities

00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:45,749
that you like to donate to let's say one

00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:48,509
is for autism the other ones for

00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:50,149
Tourette's syndrome let's say that you

00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,279
write a post about Tourette's syndrome

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,619
do you want the one like say the the

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,989
donate part at the bottom to be about

00:14:55,619 --> 00:15:01,079
autism no you want that to be about

00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:03,479
Tourette syndrome so you would create

00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,239
let's say a template for the Tourette's

00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:09,839
syndrome one and then say I want to use

00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,970
this template it will then show the

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,319
template with whatever piece you had at

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,739
the bottom and then you just write your

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:18,659
content does that make sense now is that

00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:26,039
a better example okay

00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:28,109
yes question okay so the question is is

00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,999
are the blocks locked in place on the

00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:32,639
templates my understanding is yes

00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:36,479
because part of the reason for the

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,529
template is the layout itself yes so we

00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:41,209
had one over here and then I'll come

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,209
over here question over there Jared

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,050
so the question is is if you change the

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,490
content does it actually alter the

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,920
original template or vice-versa I'd have

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,720
to look into that whether or not that

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,680
changes the existing ones

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,980
it may not my thinking is it creates an

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,570
instance of it so my thinking would be

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,620
no because it essentially takes the

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,810
template copies it over and then does

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,550
whatever whatever piece you need to do

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,339
if you were to go back and change the

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,870
template my thinking is is that the

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,430
original would probably stay in place

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,000
but somebody correct me if I'm incorrect

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:32,630
or we'll take a look at it afterwards

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,430
yeah I I would think that it does not

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,770
affect the post that you've originally

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,070
created yeah we had a question over here

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,070
as well

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:52,400
how does it affect archive URLs so how

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,400
does it affect archives

00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:11,740
so I the question is can I still use the

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,569
archive and I guess categories URLs with

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,419
Gutenberg I don't think that the two are

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,100
dependent on one another because you

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,709
would actually create the template and

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,110
then choose whatever category that

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,360
you're putting it into right and it

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,789
might actually maintain those categories

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,900
too that's something I didn't actually

00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,210
look at I'll have to look that up

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,720
afterwards okay does that answer your

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:41,169
question

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:44,140
okay anything else Peter so the question

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:46,809
is are the original PHP templates still

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,230
available which ones are you referring

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:55,480
to

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:57,280
oh the full screen full screen with

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,419
sidebar things like that I would imagine

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,390
that they are but they might be they

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:07,059
might be available under the original

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:13,450
editor there probably ain't still in the

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:17,400
hierarchy somewhere Peter probably I

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,780
have no doubt I've no doubt anybody else

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,760
so we're making good progress right like

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,760
it's making sense okay good

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,080
okay so in our real estate example as I

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,320
mentioned the custom post type is the

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,390
listing itself it's not just about

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,179
layout okay I want to emphasize that

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,970
it's not just about the layout it's

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,059
about the back end as well as the front

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:47,679
end what I mean by that is not I'm not

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:50,679
talking code I'm talking dashboard like

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:55,120
manager like person who is managing the

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:57,039
site entering in information and also

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,720
then showing it on the front end which

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,190
is where your visitors will see them so

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,380
what i'm referring to back end in front

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,230
end in the context of this talk I'm

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,669
talking dashboard and visitor like

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,600
somebody's managing the site versus that

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,090
not code

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,800
so what you might see on a custom post

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,230
type in the backend was what I showed

00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,510
you earlier so let's say that I'm the

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,490
manager of this real estate site maybe

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm the the actual person who's selling

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,860
these so I might have to enter in the

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,210
municipal address and all of these other

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,330
things that are going to show up

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,170
uniquely in the custom post type on the

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:35,450
front end right they may have a

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,130
particular font or a particular piece of

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,130
information but they actually become an

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,170
entry in the database that I can recall

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,420
that I can use in other places I can

00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,060
move that around that one little piece

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:52,250
of data or that type of field I can put

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:53,690
anywhere on my site anywhere so that's a

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,810
custom field something like a sale price

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,780
a rental price the size of the unit and

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,550
I can put square feet at the end of it

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,190
so that it will actually show on the

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,980
front end why would somebody go through

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,120
the trouble of creating this it's very

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:15,740
simple to recognize the pieces of

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,200
information that are required or in the

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,800
format that it needs to be entered in by

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,800
the manager themselves so those of you

00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,630
who are developing sites for clients may

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,750
want to consider this especially if they

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:32,060
have a need such as this because then

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,980
this will not create the post if it says

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,710
I'm sorry you have to have a sale price

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:41,360
in here that makes sense

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:43,880
it guides the manager on how to enter

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,310
data and what data needs to be required

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,800
and then it will show on the front end

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,600
if the developer or person who has

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,090
created the custom post type and the

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,580
fields has actually done it correctly

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,440
now keep in mind I'm going to address

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,220
this later but they would have to have

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,050
coded it properly to show that way

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,400
questions on that

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,990
like sort of saw one that was kind of

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,700
like yeah maybe I have a question maybe

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:12,690
I don't okay does this make sense then

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,039
okay

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,269
so this is an example that I showed last

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,269
year I know I'm talking a lot about

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,490
custom post types but trust me bear with

00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:23,740
me bear with me on this journey because

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,720
it will be cleared very shortly so this

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,440
is an example of a custom post type you

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,999
could in theory create a Guttenberg

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,289
template that will look exactly like

00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:38,490
this okay the problem is is that that's

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:42,220
only being done in the editor itself

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:45,460
okay in the classic editor you had to as

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:48,100
I showed with the custom post in the

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,789
backend the dashboard right it required

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:54,279
you to put in a price it required you to

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:57,940
put in square footage if you were to do

00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,139
this as a Guttenberg template there's no

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,480
required fields here

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:03,610
there's nothing here telling the user

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,769
yes you have to put this in so basically

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,450
if I took all of this out and it was

00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:11,529
just a bunch of Guttenberg blocks this

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,799
would end up being blank so to me the

00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:17,860
custom post type and the ACS are still

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,460
something that should be a part of this

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,529
whole environment the templates have

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,730
their place

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:28,570
okay that's ultimately the goal in

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:30,309
getting to here so this is this was

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,850
actually built as a custom post type so

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:36,279
it has a title right it has a a category

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,230
unto itself so let's say that this is

00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,080
actually a real estate listing I might

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,269
categorize it as a listing it may have

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,720
its own piece on the menu that drops

00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:47,889
down and so on a Guttenberg template

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,690
doesn't give you that level of

00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:52,149
organization you can add it to its own

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,110
category but it may not have its own

00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:58,240
level of hierarchy right it's written by

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,990
this person the type of listing is a

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,850
detached home all of these this is

00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,309
actually the type of listing and the

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:10,269
features type of ownership are actually

00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:12,450
all taxonomy --zz okay there are ways of

00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:15,610
organizing the information okay

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,040
the municipal address los angeles and

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:21,910
this is a Gasol no doubt

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,180
okay so this whole piece right the image

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:31,890
and all of this together along with the

00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,890
tags is the custom post type itself okay

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:38,800
this is one of the advanced custom

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,480
fields and I'm saying advanced custom

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:46,090
fields because I did use that plugin for

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,860
this okay does that make sense so things

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,070
like square footage things like that are

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,670
all required pieces that I would have to

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,380
enter for this entry to be valid see

00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,940
some hands about to go up so I'm going

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:03,480
to pause for a moment are there any

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,480
questions question over here

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:10,570
so which plugin did I use is is actually

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:12,310
called advanced custom fields so the the

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,120
actual field itself because it's

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:18,250
customized is called a custom field the

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:24,940
plug-in that I use to create those is

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:27,330
called advanced custom fields now to be

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,380
clear though the custom post type

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:36,070
plug-in because there is a plug-in I

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:38,170
created I coated myself it's actually

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,860
not as hard as you think I'll tell you

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,310
about that in a minute

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,350
it's not hard right right see yeah I got

00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,780
some confirmation out there it's

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,790
actually a lot easier than you think and

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,060
it has some references at the end that

00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:54,160
will guide you to how to do that stuff

00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,150
okay trust me it's great great content

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,830
and I'll tell you about it in a second

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,830
so question over here

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,390
so is a custom field something that is

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,320
in the dashboard is forcing that data

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:20,140
validation it can to me that is one of

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,250
the biggest features as it comes to a

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,990
block in Gutenberg versus an ACF we're

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,290
talking about things that you would have

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,930
to enter if it's just a block I don't

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,760
have to fill it or I do have to fill it

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,560
but if you're building it in something

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,490
like a custom post type it's gonna say

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,960
no you have to fill that in right but no

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,910
you're not oversimplifying it that

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:53,650
actually makes a lot of sense question

00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:55,300
over here and then I'll go here so

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,390
you're saying you're asking if there are

00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,880
ways to have a Guttenberg block be

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,560
required like maybe some JavaScript that

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,950
you can install or something like that I

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,860
don't know I'm sure there is

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,660
I haven't delved into it so far that

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,130
I've had to go that route does anybody

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,430
else have any input on that

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,970
not yet Gutenberg is still so fresh in

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,300
our heads but to me a Guttenberg block

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,990
does live on the backend in the editor

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:30,270
itself which the cpt does is well but

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,450
it's that's a tough call I don't know

00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,040
okay

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,630
well the limit then then let me know

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,400
when you give your talk at WordCamp

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,810
Hamilton next year okay

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,190
you're saying it's easier to use ACF

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:47,560
than doable but probably easier with

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,520
ACF's okay so we have at least one

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,360
opinion either and thank you I

00:26:48,520 --> 00:27:02,530
appreciate that

00:26:49,360 --> 00:27:03,910
any other questions Peter so you have

00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:07,720
the pro version but you're asking if

00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,670
this can be done on the free one well I

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,570
know that when I built this I didn't use

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:18,280
a paid version yeah the last time I

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:20,260
actually delved into ACF I remember

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,520
being able to do almost everything that

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,340
I wanted to do with it

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,960
at a very basic level there were some

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,110
things that I probably needed to step up

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,200
in my game if I wanted certain things to

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,240
happen I'm trying to remember but it's

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,910
pretty good as it is that's my point as

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:42,990
a free version yeah any other questions

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:42,990
or comments no okay let's keep going

00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:51,700
okay so in our real estate example we're

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,080
now talking Gutenberg we're talking

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,990
about the gutenberg template so if you

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,930
recall the listing itself has all those

00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:01,630
required fields and everything else if

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:06,150
you were to relate this or why would you

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:09,280
use gutenberg templates for such a thing

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,220
every listing for different houses that

00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,780
are identical how many of you have

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,210
actually ever done real estate or have

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,380
some experience in real estate tons of

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,010
you and they're all on this side of the

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,110
room what's going on I don't know so

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,500
think about it this way you've been

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,680
hired as a real estate agent to sell 10

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,140
houses that are absolutely identical but

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,210
the only difference really is other than

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,280
the square footage or well the square

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,860
footage might change as well the price

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,170
might be the same the address is almost

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,170
identical are you going to create a

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,790
custom post type put in let's say it

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,860
hasn't even been built yet right we're

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,590
talking pre-built it's an artist's

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,200
rendering it's the same artist rendering

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,600
for all

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,330
ten posts are you gonna go in and create

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,290
one post and I'm using custom post types

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:05,570
one listing for this address put in the

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:09,890
image put any address the price that it

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:15,170
so on and so forth save it and do it

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:18,260
again ten times no you're not because

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,780
you're all smarter than that what you

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,910
could effectively do and this hasn't

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,820
been tried but in theory let's think

00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:30,350
about this you create a custom post type

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:35,930
for a listing now you create the listing

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:38,810
itself and then create the template now

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,700
I have this template for let's say a

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,520
particular project or a particular

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:47,210
development that is being built and

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,130
let's say I think I actually have a No

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,840
so let's say that I have you know this

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,670
address this address in this wrist let's

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:59,450
say it's like three five seven nine and

00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:01,130
thirteen just because it's thirteen and

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,780
you have all of those houses but it's

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,160
all an artist rendering the prices are

00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,870
the same the square footage is the same

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,870
the only thing that changes is the one

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,990
number on the municipal address does

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:15,680
that make sense that is an example of

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,200
where you might want to take advantage

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,110
of the guttenberg templates because a

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,930
custom post type while you have default

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,060
values in those fields does not

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:30,050
necessarily when you create a new one

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:33,500
take the existing data with it that's

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,120
where the difference is I'm seeing a lot

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,980
of heads nodding so I'm getting this sir

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,980
right great question

00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:04,980
yes

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,600
so in short my my scenario here is

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,269
actually using the custom post type

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,980
listing creating the listing with all

00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:15,149
the data that you need and so on

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,940
hitting create a template it should save

00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:21,240
all the data in theory because I haven't

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,830
tried this yet in theory it should save

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,960
all that data you now have a template so

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,820
instead of going to listing creating

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,340
another listing you would actually go to

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,809
the templates create a new template and

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,970
it should have all the data stored there

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,980
and then you just change whatever data

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,440
it is hit go to change whatever data

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,379
needs to be hit go and the way you have

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,769
it so yes that's exactly what I'm

00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:46,740
proposing is that the to again in theory

00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:48,389
should be able to be used together for

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,580
such a thing now I'm using real estate

00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:52,110
as an example because that's what my my

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,499
background knowledge is way back when

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,639
and another lifetime but you could use

00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,679
this for almost anything we'll go

00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,990
through another example as well okay we

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:10,320
have another question no okay

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:11,999
yes go ahead oh yes if you change the

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:21,720
template yes go ahead

00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:23,940
and it oh it's dynamic okay so where's

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,919
Jared there you are so here's your

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,169
answer to that earlier question about

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,570
the templates so apparently if you do

00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,220
change the template it will

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,590
automatically update any post that

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,740
you've created beforehand is that

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,740
accurate

00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,090
you need to republish them you don't

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,590
need to republish them okay so so it

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,889
will actually take anything that you've

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,320
created with that template and update it

00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:51,059
accordingly

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,730
so it's not an instance it's more of a

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:54,070
reference

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,770
as opposed to an instance would that be

00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,620
it's not a snapshot it's it's actually

00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:02,230
gonna keep calling it it's gonna

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,270
republish across the database okay all

00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:14,380
right does that make sense then okay you

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:15,970
have a question that's exactly the

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,160
that's exactly what I'm going with

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,230
create the custom post type as a listing

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,750
that has all the requirements and

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,670
everything else that you want right that

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,770
you that you may or may not use on your

00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,450
site already every day as a real estate

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,940
agent you would probably use that

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,520
listing every day but the data changes

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,400
the address changes the photo changes

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,750
the square footage changes the blah blah

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,520
what I'm suggesting is is let's say that

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,650
you had 10 houses that were identical

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,400
that you had to sell are you going to

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,140
sit there and create 10 new new listings

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,830
when they're all the same except for one

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,560
piece of data no you're gonna create one

00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:55,390
create a guttenberg template and instead

00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,000
of calling the listing you're gonna call

00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:03,850
the template and then create one for

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,120
number 5 for number 7 and so on does

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,120
that make sense

00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:20,880
no I think I think it would be the data

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:24,179
itself that remains but like if we

00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,450
change say like the layout I'd have to

00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,040
double-check on that I see your point I

00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,770
see your point on that so if you enter

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,100
in the data and you copy it over that's

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:41,340
a good point okay let's let's figure

00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:42,810
that out afterwards but if you're

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,610
updating the listing itself and you're

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,570
updating the custom post type not the

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,590
actual Guttenberg template yeah so yeah

00:34:48,570 --> 00:35:01,050
what we'll have to take that back and

00:34:49,590 --> 00:35:03,450
look at that that's a good point I'd

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,100
have to look back into whether or not my

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,840
theory is is that you should be able to

00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,490
save it as a Guttenberg because the

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,820
thing is the whole point about templates

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:14,460
is you should be able to to update those

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,740
but saying that here's the thing though

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:22,800
if you've thought through your project

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:25,110
well enough come on you guys plan

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,480
everything out right you've been in my

00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:30,570
talks before come on post-it notes yet

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,020
every the the thinking is this though is

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:40,500
that if you're only updating the

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:43,200
template right so why would you update

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,030
the template only for those ten why

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,410
would you have to if in its so then you

00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,230
would probably end up updating the

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,230
template for a reason that would require

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,180
them all to do so right you're not

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,400
updating all of your listings you're

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,030
just updating those ten but you bring up

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
a good point

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,530
I may have to investigate that does it

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,040
update the data or is it just like the

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:08,240
layout things like that it does update

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,240
the data okay

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,940
okay you may have to detail okay so

00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,730
maybe there's a way to detach it from

00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,110
the template afterwards okay let's let's

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,060
talk about that afterwards that's gonna

00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,100
be an interesting interesting chat and

00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,400
let me know when you do your talk next

00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,490
year at WordCamp Hamilton right yeah

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,700
any other questions okay we're almost

00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:34,850
through this I promise so this is an

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,470
example of the Guttenberg block that you

00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:40,790
can get right out of the box right so

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:44,540
what I have here is is just the address

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:49,780
like line 1 line 2 line 3 etc etc right

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:52,700
so keep in mind that you can create a

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:57,290
Guttenberg block or a collection of

00:36:52,700 --> 00:37:00,650
blocks that can form a larger block

00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:03,770
right so in this case when you actually

00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,520
add an address that is a combination of

00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:09,380
a number of blocks in themselves so it's

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,190
like blocks within blocks does that make

00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,720
sense so the idea here is if you were

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,060
selling a bunch of houses that were the

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,010
same the same photo same rendering

00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,020
whatever and you didn't want to have to

00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,690
retype it over and over this is you know

00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:29,240
an example of what you might use just in

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:32,690
a standard gutenberg layout that's not

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,820
gonna update in let's say a database

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,010
somewhere it's gonna store it as part of

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,320
the post but it's not gonna actually

00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,320
store it as hey this is an address that

00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,960
you're selling right it's just an

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,300
address a big deal it's gonna format it

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,260
but it's not actually gonna access it

00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,540
later on does that make sense it can get

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,170
really complex I get that but you see

00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,920
where this is going

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,810
okay so I'm gonna show a you know some

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,580
of the you know the big big difference

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,100
between this and I'm sort of alluded to

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,400
it already so why would I use one and

00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,840
not the other right if you decide okay

00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,820
you know what I'm just gonna use one

00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,830
that's it I'm gonna go with eeeh there

00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,340
Guttenberg I'm gonna go with custom post

00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:20,740
types and ACF's now it will depend

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:28,390
so hear me out what is the big

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:30,100
difference no code honestly truly other

00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:34,030
than the data stuff that we've discussed

00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,870
and everything else using Gutenberg it

00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:39,400
does not require you to code anything

00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,980
okay now there are plugins out there

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,850
that will also do custom post types bear

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,840
with me on that one

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:49,600
I agree so technically you could but

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,600
those plugins will probably then they

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,000
will either you have to add them on to

00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,890
your theme so that they show and same

00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,310
thing with the advanced custom fields it

00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:05,100
does require some work my proposal to

00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,540
you is that it's worth it

00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,570
okay that's what that's what I'm

00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:14,950
proposing with Gutenberg it's just a

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:16,810
piece of text at the end of day using

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,970
something like ACS and custom post types

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,160
we're actually thinking about the data

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,900
that we're putting out there right

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,200
you're actually organizing it in certain

00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,180
way does that make sense so let me give

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,370
you a couple of examples cuz we aren't

00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:35,870
running for it but let me just

00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:39,530
so here's an example right IMDb the

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:42,140
custom post pipe is going to be the TV

00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,750
listing you can have seasons and it's

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:48,500
gonna have episodes and every single one

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,960
of those seasons is going to have

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,040
episodes in every episode you're going

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:59,930
to put episode 5 episode 6 episode 7 you

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:03,890
create the custom post type for every TV

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,090
listings that you have and then you fill

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,820
in the data and let's say that you've

00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:10,400
just added a new series you're gonna put

00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,730
in the title of the of the series once

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,770
maybe right it may be a separate entries

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,300
or whatever but in the episode itself

00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,860
you're gonna have to put the episode in

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,410
there's gonna be names that you have to

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,870
fill in but the episode title is

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,640
actually you know episode number of blah

00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,530
blah blah you're gonna have to keep that

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,870
over and over

00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,090
especially if it's eating food the title

00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,760
of the show itself you're gonna have to

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,460
repeat that let's say you know depending

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,570
on which which continent you're on if

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,070
you're in the British series you're

00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,950
probably gonna go with like four to six

00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,750
episodes and if you're in North America

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,370
we're gonna go to 13 just a first happy

00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,260
together

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,420
great that's a lot of repeating so the

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,340
theory here is that you create the

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,720
custom post types for the actual TV

00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,680
listening but you're going out your site

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,480
regardless and you know whether you

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,610
change it or not and then you're gonna

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,920
create let's say a TV series where the

00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:05,380
data in itself is going to be the same

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,660
do we create a template in the face of

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,900
this show where the title is the same

00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,670
may be the episode in saying the time is

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,540
the same all of that kind of stuff I

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,070
mean they're going to just repeat that

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,080
with me definitely that over and over

00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,750
and over and then really once you're

00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,890
done with the template definitely

00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,890
archive it I wouldn't throw it away

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:31,020
this is archive it okay same thing with

00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:33,450
a person right they may have different

00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,529
roles I unusualness a community of

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,150
course that you have a release date

00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:37,500
let's say that you're entering all the

00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,349
movies that came out on that particular

00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:44,819
day let's say you're you know entering a

00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:46,920
series something that came out one by

00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:49,309
one by one and they have the same actors

00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,569
attached to them and so on make sense

00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:55,880
same sort of idea same thing with the

00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,980
person

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,510
so the movie itself may have those

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,450
repeating pieces otherwise you have this

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:08,080
where you have the date of birth the

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,010
person itself may not necessarily have

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,230
everything you know it may not

00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,690
necessarily apply here but it does apply

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,310
for the custom post type itself it's

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:20,000
unlikely that you're going to have to

00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,320
copy over data from one person to the

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,840
next they're gonna have different names

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,859
different gates and whatever they may

00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,479
belong to the same

00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:32,590
with us about it other necessarily so in

00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:36,280
case you didn't know that's not

00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:38,260
no I oh okay no no no that's that's one

00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,080
of our friend Shawn Cooper who couldn't

00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,680
be here so I I had to sort of mimic yeah

00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,150
yeah

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
somebody somebody uh fell through my

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,040
actually made that up a couple years ago

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
and I

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,730
okay so last couple things there I'm

00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,710
gonna post these slides after the talk

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:02,250
okay they're going to go up on Chavez PA

00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,710
and then they're going to be some lovely

00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,310
resources for you so give you just a

00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,480
quick one

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,480
