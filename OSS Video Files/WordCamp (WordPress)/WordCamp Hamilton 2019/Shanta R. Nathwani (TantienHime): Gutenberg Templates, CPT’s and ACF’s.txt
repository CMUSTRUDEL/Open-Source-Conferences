Title: Shanta R. Nathwani (TantienHime): Gutenberg Templates, CPT’s and ACF’s
Publication date: 2019-09-07

Description: 
	In our last episode, dear campers, we learned about Custom Post Types (CPT’s) and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF’s) and why we need them. We had everything clear, right? Enter Gutenberg…
Until Gutenberg, we had to copy over content from one old post to the new. The other option is to use CPT’s and ACF’s. What’s the difference? When should you use one or the other… or BOTH?
In this session, we’ll take a quick review of CPT’s and ACF’s, then compare them to Gutenberg Blocks and Templates, and discuss when you should use each and why.
