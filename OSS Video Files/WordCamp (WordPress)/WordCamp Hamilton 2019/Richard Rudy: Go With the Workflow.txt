Title: Richard Rudy: Go With the Workflow
Publication date: 2019-09-07

Description: 
	Dealing with multiple themes, layout editors, and plugins is hard. The key is having a semi-standard workflow for getting sites from concept to production efficiently. Youâ€™ll see how using a few standard tools (Plesk, Elementor, Gravity Form, ACS) you can efficiently build complex sites for yourself or your clients.

oh you got the swap

00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,639
parts that work flow easily and a lot of

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,949
that comes down to tools and process and

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,390
I try to keep my workflows as flexible

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,039
as possible because you never know how

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,840
someone's gonna want to work or you know

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,789
they need to use their server or

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,329
whatever so you want to control as much

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,009
as possible because when variables come

00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,630
in you can account for them do you know

00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,820
okay well I know how long it takes me do

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,020
this stuff in mind this is gonna do this

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,300
is gonna be different so I'm gonna have

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,830
to increase my quote because we got to

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,260
use their server or we gotta do whatever

00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,970
so tools tools are often easiest to

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,760
control you can you can control what

00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,110
tools you are using and the more

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,600
facility miliar are with your own tools

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,190
the better you can dissipate problems so

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,380
you know if you know your server you

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,700
know how long it takes you to get live

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,310
on it if you know you know your

00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,990
configured your themes you know you know

00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:05,750
what problems they have so first off you

00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,840
can start with hosting we don't believe

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,790
in cheap hosting where I work I always

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,870
say if you spend more on Starbucks than

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:18,230
you do on your hosting you're doing it

00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:21,740
wrong case point so we tend to host on

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,990
AWS using Plesk as a control panel

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,729
AWS we use because a lot of our clients

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,040
are using a ws because they're their SAS

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,690
service providers so they already have

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,080
internal staff that can manage the

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,049
server and you know it's kind of robust

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,690
infrastructure so you know if AWS goes

00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:42,350
down everybody's going down right

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:45,260
it is self-managed so you do have to

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:50,270
have a certain amount of knowledge to

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,010
get up and running but it's automated

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,659
like you can automate all those things

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,619
once you get used to it you can script a

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,580
lot of things you can spin up a server

00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:00,110
like that when you're ready the line

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,700
next distro we use when you come to use

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,780
CentOS but it doesn't really matter you

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,179
can pick whatever you want and we tend

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,310
to use plus onyx for for a couple of

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:16,520
reasons I like it because it's got a

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,760
really powerful management stack you can

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,349
edit apache files nginx files PHP set

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,409
right in the panel so you don't have to

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,489
like SSH in and remember oh where is it

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:31,470
in this district or do they keep the

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:34,079
option files worth configuration it's

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,870
got some pretty advanced integrations

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,030
like it's got like one click get deploy

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,459
right in the panel so if you're a person

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,010
works to do your themes and get you can

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,400
just link it up on the instance and just

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,709
when are you ready pull pull pull as you

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,879
go and that's right from the web panel

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,200
it also has built-in let's encrypt so

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,760
you can get one

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,290
let's search I forget really easily and

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,980
it automatically news and you don't

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,959
worry about setting up weird you know

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:08,579
deploy robots to to renew your

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:11,030
certificate every three months and it's

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,920
got a really good WordPress toolbox I

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,120
can basically spin up a wordpress

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,760
instance it lets me create sets of

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,769
plugins and themes so I can basically

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,169
one-click I spin up that instance with

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,720
all the plugins I want without having to

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:32,699
install them manually and it's easy to

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:39,150
clone from from dev to live one-click so

00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:40,680
it saves you a lot of time there so the

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,120
key takeaways from that hosting you want

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,819
to be familiar you want to be

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,340
automatable if that's a word you want to

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,639
be flexible and you want to have if

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,560
possible and easy dev stage yeah I tend

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,599
to use elementra Pro with hello theme

00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:03,209
I'll get more to those later and then my

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,430
standard plug-in set kind of includes

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,190
gravity forms I like it better than

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,230
other forms because it's really powerful

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,120
I can do stuff like if I want to build a

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,889
ROI calculator I can do it right in

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,480
gravity forms only an extra plug-in and

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,099
there's my contact forms and all that

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,720
the normal stuff

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,340
if I'm just doing if it only needs a

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,580
contact form a lot of times just rely on

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,470
Elementor pros form plug-in because it

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,430
just comes with a form thing and it's

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:33,719
fairly good advanced custom fields for

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,090
custom metadata cpt UI which i think

00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,040
there's

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,660
already talking to be done on on those

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,280
two later so I'm going to those too much

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:48,220
Yost that's what our SEO guys like so I

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:53,500
put it on and I used WPS CSS which is a

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,180
sass compiler that works in PHP part of

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,290
the reason is because hello theme

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,540
actually includes the sass files so I

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,880
can upload sass files and have a compile

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:10,540
and I don't have to do an extra CSS file

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:12,760
it's the the native theme CSS and you

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,460
know as a kind of a side I do tend to

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,350
then use the wordpress theme editor a

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,810
bit too much so i just added the CSS

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:24,160
files in the theme editor which I tell

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,669
people never to do and kind of a few

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,889
extra helpful extras I use custom icons

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:36,810
for Elementor which lets me upload a

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:39,700
like a SVG font file and anywhere that

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,780
Elementor it has like an icon i can

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,000
replace it with my own a lot custom

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,120
skins which lets you create custom loops

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,500
in Elementor I did I'm hearing rumors

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,940
that's not being support anymore so I'm

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,830
kind of trying to find a replacement or

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,740
hoping that Elementor actually ends up

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,910
just making that as part of their core

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,600
functionality because nice because like

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,060
I can create a custom skin for for the

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,979
archives post so I can make it look how

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,240
I want instead of like the two options

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,650
alimentary comes with out of the out of

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,760
the box I just put on redirection just

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,889
because you know you whatever you're

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,940
launching a live you site usually have

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,130
to do some redirection because

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,600
something's changing

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:26,350
I like seed Pro coming soon seed pod can

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,630
soon Pro elementra has a coming soon

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,300
functionality but I like seed prod

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,550
because it lets you bypass it with a

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,729
variable so you don't log into WordPress

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,979
to to bypass the coming soon page it's

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,470
really good when your client needs to

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:44,140
kind of circulate it around their team

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,090
you don't to give everyone access to to

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,770
WordPress you can just send them a URL

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,870
with like bypass

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,830
with whatever variable you set and then

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,560
they can share it internally without

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,569
actually having to give you no logins to

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,460
everybody so when the CEO wants to see

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:02,319
the new website they can see it without

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:05,560
having never find a new password and for

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,139
feedback I've been using lately project

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,110
huddled I oh it's a wordpress plugin

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,840
that lives on another wordpress instance

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,750
so you kind of spin up your own

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,160
WordPress site install project huddle

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,840
and then you put a little bit JavaScript

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,889
on the site so you can use on basically

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
you don't feel worries on WordPress you

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,470
can use it anywhere and it gives you

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,210
on-page commenting so like just like a

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,460
PDF comment you can like add a little

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,380
sticky note make a comment and you can

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,220
discuss anyone who has access can

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,280
discuss we were using bug herd but bug

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,500
herd they changed it where you can only

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,069
see your own comments so it was it

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,590
wasn't good for James discussing it so

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,090
lately been playing with that been happy

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,889
with it so far

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,150
so Elementor plus hello a theme so I

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,719
don't know if you guys are familiar with

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:02,830
Elementor it's a fairly decent layout

00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,909
plugin it's good cuz live gives you a

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,250
lot of options there's not a lot of

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:10,060
abstraction like you don't have like

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:12,550
that visual composer view of just blocks

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,310
it's actually WYSIWYG and you can edit

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,259
right in browser so you can you know the

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,650
client can put their cursor in where the

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:23,770
text goes and just start typing it's

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,770
fairly performant it's you know it's a

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,180
it's a lay-up plugin it's not gonna be

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,460
it's not gonna be a rocket no matter

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,669
what you do it's very few I've seen that

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,079
are really fast anyway there's minimal

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,539
accessibility issues so if you're

00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:40,300
working Ontario that's a good thing

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,039
because most web designers don't even

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,510
know that accessibility is actually a

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,950
law in Ontario that your website has to

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,550
be accessible it's fairly customizable

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,570
and the pro version give you like the

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,790
ability to custom headers and footers

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,230
and

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,050
hello theme is nice because it's totally

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,420
neutral so it's there's it's really

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,000
nothing to it

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,090
and I'm a person I can write probably

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,120
CSS faster than I can find options in

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,180
the WordPress customizer so I just you

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,270
know write write my h1 tag CSS write my

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,680
body CSS for my thing I you know I

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,270
didn't have to dig in through the

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,160
WordPress editor and find out what how

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,910
are they how do they organize their

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,150
customizer I don't know so it's nice

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:32,120
because and what I've done is it's it's

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:36,350
been recently added to the get to the

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,210
WordPress repo for themes until until

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,030
like about two weeks ago you can only

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:45,310
get on github so I just forked a version

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:48,560
with and it has like a lot of CSS files

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,090
with the standard things I customized so

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
like I had like a typography assassin

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,330
where I just throw in my options aren't

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,150
alike remember all what selectors is it

00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:04,940
for header tags for each different thing

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:08,540
ya know well hello has been around for a

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,490
while but for about a year or two it

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,750
just I recently moved it to the

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,680
WordPress repo so you can just install

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,900
it from WordPress

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,390
I still use the git repo because I end

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,970
up customizing it a lot and so that's

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,700
the URL from my branch of it which has a

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,910
lot of those optimization options in it

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,520
already in in sass files so you just you

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,770
go in add the add the variables add the

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,990
stuff and it compiles new sass for you

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:40,190
for using WP CSS or if you're compiling

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:42,140
locally so the next step is process

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,480
there's a little less control here but

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,820
you still want to standardize it to a

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,120
certain extent because you can kind of

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,900
plan your project that way so usually we

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,330
start wireframing then we go to move to

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,940
design then the build which is actually

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:05,050
taking the design and putting all the

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:08,470
pages in we testing optimize and watch

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:14,020
so here's what I'm gonna lose the room

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:20,380
all right before you start any work get

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:22,960
content first I mean it and this is the

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,390
hardest part because web design is one

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,100
the few industries where designers were

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,060
like okay well design it and then you

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,130
give us the content like if you go to

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,350
design an ad for print you get the

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,850
content first then you design the ad you

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,600
want to design a book you get the

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:41,700
content first then you design the book

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,660
right and getting the content first

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:50,260
saves you a lot of headaches down the

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:53,200
road what happens is having the content

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,240
first means the the client can you

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,350
know figure out what they really want

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,030
and content the hardest part for a

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,070
client how many times have you have

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,240
talked to a client they're like oh we

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,410
have a website right now I'll just edit

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,480
the copy I'll get it back to you in a

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:10,630
week two months later you're still

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:13,630
waiting for copy and realistically you

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,210
don't need all the content I sometimes

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,610
depending on the the size of the project

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,160
or the speed I say you know get me the

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,980
home page get me like your longest

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,180
product and your shortest product final

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,830
copy because if you have the two

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,650
extremes everything you can in the

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,630
middle for like a large product website

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,270
is easy to figure out because you know

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,830
okay I need to be able to you know have

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:45,550
this much copy and this little copy and

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:50,040
supposed to look good so I frames no

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:55,660
content I tend to wireframe in browser

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:58,480
either using a framework like foundation

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,890
or I'll do it right in element or with

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,750
hello so this way the client can see how

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,120
their content flows they give you a

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,550
bunch of content and they see oh well

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,870
realistically once in our page I think

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,280
these two points should be in a

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,230
different order or we need to say this

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,790
further up the page

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,350
they have a better idea where thing to

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,490
put that call to action because when

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,660
they write the copy they don't necessary

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,070
think calls action but then I just

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,930
scrolling through like oh wait we really

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,940
should get them to do something here at

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,050
this point and then the other thing

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,850
about wireframing is they're not

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,610
distracted by weird things like poor

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,940
image choice or color choice like you

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,860
you'll send a design to a client and

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,360
they'll just obsess well I don't like

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,430
the picture that guy and they'll totally

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,220
forget about everything else or can we

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:51,830
get a puppy right if you do a wireframe

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,960
it takes all that away right they can't

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,430
be there they can't be distracted by the

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,900
colours that they don't like or the

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,690
image choice they don't like all they

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:08,050
are worried about is content so kind of

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:10,580
a example so this is one we recently did

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,840
realistically it's very simple this is

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:22,670
done right in element or in a little bit

00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:27,080
interaction a little bit of stuff in

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:29,540
this case we're doing the copy so I was

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,200
able to use like lorem ipsum a little

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,870
bit more of the of the copy just because

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,610
our copier is writing it so I had a

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:45,890
little bit more control over what the

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:48,670
final product was so yeah so like this

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:52,190
is like a product market vertical page

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,170
right we do right in element or the car

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,980
you can see it give feedback they see it

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,980
as an actual page

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:14,350
we did this so potential problems with

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,750
wireframing client centers have trouble

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,700
visualizing it right they'll go well I

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,380
don't get how my picture house is gonna

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,430
look with pictures in it but that's not

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,020
what they're worried about there and

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,950
it's trying to keep them focus like you

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,540
know I'm worried about pictures now you

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,700
got to worry about is this the right

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,980
order is there the right emphasis on

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,240
certain points you know are we talking

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,270
about the right thing at the right time

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,250
on the page you can burn too much time

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,380
trying get things just right just just

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,940
it's it's you got to be fast you got to

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,760
be iterative don't waste too much time

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,920
on these contribu a lot of copy

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,839
revisions they can once they actually

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,930
see how the copy looks in order they

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,790
want to rewrite it which it's a problem

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,020
but it's a good thing because they're

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,870
gonna get closer to what they need so

00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,089
and then you move to design often I'll

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,610
move to an offline editing tool for for

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:06,579
the initial design like I'll go to like

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,870
illustrator or experience design or if

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:12,610
you like what else it like any other

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,350
tools and I'll just do like a static

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,440
mock-up in that kind of base on the

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,910
wireframe because you know most desires

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,079
wireframes are first step any way

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,860
they're doing it anyway so you might as

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:27,160
well show the client it so and then once

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,290
I kind of get a first feedback on on the

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,870
kind of static version of the site I'll

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:39,790
move it into Elementor and just start

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:42,640
designing it I tend to try to plan my

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,800
usable reusable blocks at this stage

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,500
Elementor lets you set global blocks and

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,959
templates so I try to start planning

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,220
ahead going okay this is probably can be

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,709
you know this section can be reusable

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,010
I'm gonna make this a template I plan

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,100
ahead

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,800
I also plan out my accessibility here

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,830
just so I know you know everything's got

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,939
the right area tags and

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,730
and things like that and build out any

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,490
page templates here for those for those

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,630
key pages you know the whole trick is

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,520
make it as reusable as possible and I

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,020
write my initial CSS at this stage

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,500
Elementor is nice because it lets you

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:27,910
write CSS on a per page and per element

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:33,250
basis right in the tool so if I just

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,900
want you know this one type of like call

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,740
to action button to look a certain way

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,090
I'll write the CSS right in that element

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,690
just to get it right and I can I can

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,970
iterate quickly that way I think it

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,770
client sign-off so you know you don't

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,120
move past this stage until the client

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,120
says yes I like how this looks

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,870
potential problems you're not thinking

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,230
responsively you're just worrying about

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,590
the desktop layout one problem I do have

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,660
with Elementor is it's written desktop

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,990
first instead of mobile first I tend to

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,419
think mobile first so it's there's a

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,280
little bit of you know work there just

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,059
to get myself to think oh yeah Mac's

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,320
with and as a result you don't have

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,020
breakpoints already set for those huge

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,110
screen sizes it kind of your last

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,300
breakpoint in Elementor is at 1024 which

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,530
you know most people screens these days

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,790
are bigger so I'm always writing a

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:33,450
little extra custom breakpoints for the

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:36,730
for the big screens to marry tools so

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,890
you put a widget in or an element and

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,780
and you don't customize it enough cuz

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,120
you like oh I don't want have to work on

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,130
this or you know it's got to be done

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,770
this way like oh it's a call to action I

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,150
have to use the call to action element

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:55,720
instead of building one from scratch

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:57,730
like and you make it a reusable block to

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,580
Mary to your vision so you your design

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,660
that it's got a look how I want let the

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,809
client give it the clients got to give

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,280
feedback you know don't fight too much

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,419
but there's some things I tend to push

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,809
back on I like I haven't built a

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,809
carousel in two years

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,250
yeah and asked for elseÃ­s this is

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,750
another big problem that they started

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:28,860
just trying to get it perfect at the

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:31,230
stage right I I tend to say we're a

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,900
works WordPress site or any website it's

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,370
a living document right it's meant to

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,320
evolve it's not meant to be static you

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,880
don't have to get it perfect you can

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,370
keep changing you can change it two

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,690
seconds after it launched you know you

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,950
don't like oh I need a period there and

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,420
the nice thing about WordPress is you

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,690
can just log in and do it you don't have

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,210
to get a developer to do it for you um

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,380
so at this point I actually start

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,950
building out the site once I have

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,440
approval on key pages and and design and

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,920
usually by this point I have enough kind

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,330
of pages built that there's enough

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,980
design language is established that

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,470
makes it easy to roll up to other pages

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,020
I kind of know what my blocks of copy

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,030
are gonna look like I know you know what

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,420
layouts I'm gonna be using for different

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,130
types of content so at this point I move

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,370
my CSS to production code so I just

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,920
usually what I'm doing is I copy that

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:29,130
element code out at a class replace the

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,220
the generic selector with my class and

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,050
in my CSS compile ins done I copy paste

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,440
change a few things and we're we have

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:41,130
production ready CSS you might do some

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,420
refactoring but you know usual stuff

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:47,310
build all my pages finalize image

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,080
selection so this is you know where you

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,610
really start worrying about is this the

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,430
right picture do I like the way this

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:58,920
lady looks is she too old does she look

00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,290
does she look happy enough um this is

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,610
where we use project huddle for feedback

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,380
because like I said the client can just

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,690
mark up the page I want change this

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,360
image I want change this copy here just

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,740
click a button and it adds a thing send

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,020
you an email to tell you hey there's a

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,640
change here even then pass that change

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,270
off to someone else assign it to someone

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,470
or you can do it yourself and then you

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,340
could just say oh your kids done and the

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,340
Clank say yeah okay good

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,300
next we move to the the test optimize

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,840
phase

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,720
so here we I tend to start chucking

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,670
forms integration so you know check your

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,320
HubSpot connections your salesforce

00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,260
connections make sure all that stuff

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,910
works as supposed to do I test my

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:47,430
caching plugin because because I'm

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:51,300
working I know my server environment I

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:54,930
can technically test my cache on dev I

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,060
don't have tests on life to my SEO

00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,910
checks any usual stuff make sure all my

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,800
images have alt tags and every page has

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,750
a Meta Description and all that stuff

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,670
which you know realistically it should

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,600
be you're doing it as you go but just do

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,400
the double check make sure didn't miss

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,520
anything

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,530
i retest accessibility just because a

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:19,910
custom it was important and this is

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:29,220
where I test my cross-browser issues and

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:30,900
any custom redirects yeah right now I -

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,040
use super caches because I'm familiar

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,510
with it

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,550
we had we had a client on site ground

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,130
and sycron has its own caching plugin

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,040
and i turned it on and set it up and

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,900
like it's still crap so I went back to

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,600
like remove their cache and plug and put

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,690
W super cache and took the set my

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,520
settings that I know and it was you know

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,280
the speed was supposed to be like but

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,890
work because I tend to I tend to plan my

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,000
performance ahead of time like I know

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm like okay I want my pages I want

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,380
them to be any bigger than X so I know

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,090
that Elementor is gonna give me a

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,360
certain amount of CSS it's gonna give me

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,610
a certain amount of JavaScript so I know

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,280
I have you know this many kilobytes to

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,440
play with for fonts and damages so from

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,090
that perspective I'm already ahead of

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,730
the game because I'm thinking about a

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,160
performance as I go but like the caching

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,490
stuff like I said yeah I find like

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,660
financially you like and use it like be

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,350
familiar with and that that's the whole

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,450
thing but workflows is finding the tools

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,530
you know how to use because you know

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,150
there's nothing worse than having to

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,330
like sit there and with someone's new

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,210
theme and go how did they set the font

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,650
size in this

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,570
where's-where's that option is in the

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,810
customizer is in a custom settings panel

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,720
yeah

00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,920
so if it's all about you know trying to

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,050
control us of many of those variables as

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:59,710
possible and then we launch so I tend to

00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,210
you know you know check the kind of turn

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,560
on the coming soon plug in make sure

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,720
it's on bond on dev remove any dev

00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,390
plugins I used because you install stuff

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,090
just for dev then it migrated the site

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:17,530
with plus it's one click I just say

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:19,030
cloned alive and I'm done then I go and

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,270
check the usual suspects make sure any

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,610
you know URLs didn't get didn't get

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,440
caught or you know you can't log into

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,300
WordPress panel just the usual gotchas

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,660
that anyone who's deployed a live site

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,820
you're probably used to it by now

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,820
I removed the coming soon plugin and

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:41,290
then I run crawl on the site I usually

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,930
use screaming frog it's an s it's a tool

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:46,300
of SEO people use but I find it's one of

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,120
the better actual crawlers it's

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,360
expensive though it's like 150 pounds a

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,640
year which for tool that I only use a

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,980
handful of times seems like a lot but it

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,940
does things that when I need that

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:07,540
feature nothing else does this thing and

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:10,120
then we're good so that I'm just going

00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:17,790
to go back and show you that this site

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:21,330
here you went this is the the wireframe

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,330
this is the final

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,679
right

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:55,390
yes it has its own chefs but it's not

00:25:51,770 --> 00:26:01,100
it's very neutral so out of the box

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:03,170
Elementor looks like this right there's

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:11,630
their the elemental hello theme has no

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:13,580
styling yeah yeah exactly you can you

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,170
can write like you can it has the

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,050
options to customize font customize

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,730
things but a lot of stuff is reusable so

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,030
you don't want to have to customize each

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,130
element every time oh I'm like oh I like

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:30,830
my headers looking a certain way or like

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:34,070
you know I have this I was lead copy or

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,980
whatever right this lead paragraph right

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,690
I'll write custom CSS for that because

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm gonna reuse on every page I don't

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,490
wanna have to go in an OP and change the

00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,490
options on everybody it's too slow right

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,680
well it depends if it's reusable if it's

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,360
a one-off I'll do it all another thing

00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,220
but if it's something like that's one

00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,990
thing is like I'll set those defaults

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,330
cuz elementra has like a neutral default

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,950
I will rewrite those to be what it

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,170
should be for this site so that way when

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,940
I create a new call to action or a new

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,370
header it already looks like what I want

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,400
and I don't have to make it look like I

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:16,970
want for that site and there's a lot of

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,980
good things already for for Elementor

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,200
that you can use it with and so you can

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,940
have those header and font options and

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:31,340
all that I can say I'm just more

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:34,310
comforting CSS so for me yeah yeah yeah

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,930
but it's like that's how you learn right

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,060
he's like you get to get to the thing I

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,340
really want to do this but I can't get

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,320
to do it with the built-in options so

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,000
how do I do it you start learning a

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,600
little bit CSS you find away someone

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,780
else did it

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,780
copy it over change some things he if it

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,420
breaks it's you know that that's web

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,539
design I always say web design is is one

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:59,959
of the the classic

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:02,269
last the classic punk art forms because

00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:04,459
punk rock was all about I don't need a

00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:06,139
music degree I can get up on a stage I

00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:08,119
know three chords I can do this and

00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:09,769
that's what Web Design is like it's like

00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,690
I don't know anything about web

00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:25,099
development I can do this I can figure

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:26,690
this out I bring this a little slide up

00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:34,009
so you guys can see where I'm the tools

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:39,819
that have specific questions back I tend

00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:42,649
to use there's a plug-in for Firefox

00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,879
called wave I think it was last year

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:45,979
last year's word camp there was an

00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:48,229
accessibility talk and and they

00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:49,940
mentioned it and I tend to use it and

00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:52,639
then I run it through like the regular

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,489
web based checkers but as I go I tend to

00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:57,289
use the the the Firefox plug-in which is

00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:58,399
really good and like I said Elementor is

00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:59,599
pretty good cousin have a lot of major

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,329
accessibility so you just remember to

00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:23,029
just set some of your area tags and

00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:25,759
things like that you know question I

00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,619
tend to I tend to rely on like plus

00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:31,609
security it's kind of like a security

00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:33,349
audit thing and yeah it's it's pretty

00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:37,729
good like because yeah I also I don't

00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:40,039
have a server guy either so so I'm like

00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:44,569
I'm not a surfer guy I've figured stuff

00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:49,789
out by having to write it's it's yeah

00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:51,619
yeah and I find sometimes sometimes one

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,889
of the curity patches will lock up I had

00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:58,789
that honors one of our servers this week

00:29:53,889 --> 00:30:01,609
where oh sorry he was asking about using

00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,219
Plesk and if we I think the security is

00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,719
decent on it and it I like that I I'm

00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,090
not sort of a guy I tend to use it I

00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:10,100
just follow its guidelines

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,070
it's pretty good and if you're using AWS

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,750
and you keep you know strict permissions

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,930
on who can have you access the panel

00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,190
it's also really good but as the thing

00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,540
we had in her issue this week where one

00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,550
of the scheduled updates to Plesk crash

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,870
the server I'm like you know 10:00 in

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,600
the morning also I get this email from

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,120
from my uptime monitor saying servers

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,330
down like why is the server down can't

00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:38,540
login can't ssh in i can't i can't do

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:43,580
anything close i log into the the adfs

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:47,420
control panel and processor usage is

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:49,370
100% like what's going on you know

00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,920
luckily backup process running so I'm

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,410
like I'm not okay reboot you log in and

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,440
I see there was a scheduled security

00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,550
update today like this attributes

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,380
yesterday so I'm like okay it must have

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:03,230
been that must have just locked up in

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,820
the update process and just reach but

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,230
like I said if you have backup process

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,790
you don't have to worry because okay

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,020
well it was backed up last night I'm

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,980
sure no one's change anything yet so

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,050
just reboot and good to go

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:21,290
so all right any any other got five

00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:22,490
minutes left any other questions um like

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,420
I said right now we back up the whole

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,950
server you say I use Schedule II which

00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:32,030
is like a just a service that lets you

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,710
schedule AWS backups but like it's

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,870
something you can set up manually in AWS

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,240
it's just like I just don't have the

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,130
time to fight with it to figure out

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,430
exactly how to do it scheduled backups

00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:46,100
in AWS so oh yeah and as an aside we're

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:49,190
we're hiring so if you're a techie dev

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:53,030
guy or a marketing person come see me

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:59,930
we're looking for more people so any

00:31:53,030 --> 00:32:02,240
other questions yep like I said there's

00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,220
a bit of a learning curve just because

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,970
like it's it's not it's self-managed

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:10,280
right but uptimes good and like I said

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,400
we use it a lot because our clients use

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,040
it we have a lot of SAS service clients

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,480
so they're already using AWS for their

00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,299
product so I can just spin up an image

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,369
and then transfer it to them

00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:23,479
but yeah there's days I'm just like oh

00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:24,259
my god I have to figure out why this

00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:27,259
isn't working

00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,019
I don't it's there's the self man it

00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,229
like something let's like manage like

00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,659
wpengine

00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:34,369
if you don't have the the internal

00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,549
resources to deal with managing a server

00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,589
so like WP engine is is great I'm like

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:44,659
that we only use a dubious because our

00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:46,399
clients use it yeah but like I said

00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,659
we're gonna talk I'm like if you're

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,429
paying more for your coffee than your

00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:52,039
hosting you're doing something wrong

00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,599
right cuz yeah like I can go to to

00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,969
GoDaddy and get like five bucks a month

00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,839
a server I'm like I spend some bucks on

00:32:55,969 --> 00:33:01,309
coffee sometimes so and and like if

00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,940
you're running a company and you're

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:06,559
making a profit you should pay for good

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,419
hosting like you should be able to

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,799
afford good hosting look yeah if you're

00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,209
just like I tell people with my console

00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,209
okay if you're just running a blog for

00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:15,109
yourself Go Daddy's fine like don't do

00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,969
you have to kill that you don't break

00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,169
the bank just do it for yourself but if

00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:23,389
you're making money on your site

00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:25,690
pay for good hosting it helps any other

00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:25,690
questions

00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,039
my general what do I do for email my

00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:36,289
general rule is don't host your email on

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,549
the same server as your website don't

00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:41,179
wash your DNS on the same servers your

00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:42,109
website so most of our clients already

00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:45,169
have email setup

00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:47,239
they're usually running either they're

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,589
running Google Apps for email or they're

00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:56,659
running office 365 so then you just have

00:33:51,589 --> 00:34:00,979
to deal with the SPF /d Kim issues for

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:02,929
your forum sending because with when you

00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:05,239
cert when when you have your email on

00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:09,490
one server and your website on another

00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:12,649
if your website sends email to you go a

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:16,210
hotmail like office 365 and Google both

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:19,639
check to make sure that the the the

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,470
server sending the email is allowed to

00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,629
send the email so if you're sending to

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:26,210
your own email address it goes well it's

00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:27,980
not me so why I can't I'm not going to

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,299
accept it and you know let you get

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,589
informed so it's more like I'm some in

00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:32,929
the forum it doesn't work but when I

00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:35,799
submit it to someone else it works fine

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,089
so it's one thing you need to understand

00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:41,419
and usually I tell most people that you

00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:44,299
just way around.this to put a what's a

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:45,950
called an SMTP plugging in because then

00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:52,099
they'll choose SMTP to send the email so

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:54,200
inside PHP mail yes so he's saying plus

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,969
cos the ability but Alex I don't host

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,130
email on the same server as my website

00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:03,589
because my website goes down my emails

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:05,630
down right so I'll pay the five bucks a

00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:08,359
month per email address on Google or or

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,309
office 365 to know that my email is up

00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:14,420
no matter what happens my emails still

00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:16,609
up I'm a big proponent of paying for

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,099
things I like if it's gonna save me time

00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:20,719
and a headache I will gladly pay I'm

00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,119
lazy I don't wanna have to sit around

00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,160
drinking this stuff and and like

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,869
managing an email server emails like

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,759
this big black box I don't know what

00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:30,289
goes on in there it just it gives me

00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,369
email it sends email I don't know what's

00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:32,809
happening and I don't know how to figure

00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,410
it out so i was like i will put it

00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:41,539
somewhere else let someone else do it

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:43,930
any other questions all right I think

00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,930
we're good

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:52,590
