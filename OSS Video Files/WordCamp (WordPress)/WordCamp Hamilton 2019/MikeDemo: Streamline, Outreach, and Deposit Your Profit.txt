Description: 
	How do you eat an elephant? Answer: one bite at a time. Like anything overwhelming, breaking it down into bite-size, easy to achieve components is the way to become efficient and efficiency is the path to profitability.  
All too common in the free and open source software market are developers who are financially frustrated, to put it lightly. Would you like to level up your profitability?
What’s stopping you as a freelancer from financial freedom? Let’s work on some of the practical things that, with just a bit of tweaking, can help you earn $100,000 in one year. 
In this talk by Mike Demopoulos (his friends call him “Demo”) will talk about ways to streamline your process, have client outreach like the big brands, and become profitable.

	00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,590
in third grade I wrote middle school

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,269
papers in HTML and I did not I did not

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,940
print the output I printed the original

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,529
code when I turned them in and the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,029
teachers did not appreciate that fun

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,500
fact though I did a report on the death

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,580
penalty and I had a MIDI plane in the

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,080
background of another one that bites

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,849
dust so I was really proud of that in

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,619
third grade yeah had a dark sense of

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:33,510
humor even back then but basically I I

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,000
started doing websites I was looking for

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,280
a CMS I started on PHP nuke and then I

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,200
found this CMS called Mambo and I was

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,180
like oh this makes the job a little bit

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,879
easier and then Mambo went belly-up

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,710
right after I joined it and then found

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,629
Joomla Mike this looks a lot like Mambo

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,160
on the back end had no idea was a fork

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,510
of the project hey I thought it was just

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,670
something that looked exactly the same

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,079
it got involved in that started

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,760
volunteering then it got involved in

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,890
WordPress started you know helping out

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,449
I'm speaking and other things and my

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,190
fell in love with community and with

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,739
that I was able to like learn these

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,450
tools really well when I was at an

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,880
agency I built hundreds of bank and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,189

websites in WordPress and I really just

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,009
really love these platforms and I've

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,229
been able to help people kind of grow

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,360
and help their businesses now my job is

about half half okay cool so how to make

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,329
a hundred thousand dollars basically you

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,110
would need to sell a hundred thousand

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,090
dollar product to one person or you sell

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,070

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,329
thousand dollar project to four people

00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,570
or sell a ten thousand dollar project to

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,310

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,110
Matheny's right so five thousand all

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,329

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,690
people or sell a five hundred dollar

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,950
project to two hundred people it's just

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,930
that easy

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,180
so but you know a lot of people like

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,849
great literally you're telling me I need

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,819
to sell $500 to 200 people and that's

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,280
all I need to do and at the end of the

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,930
day and I'm what I talk to people and

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,110
I'm like yeah that is literally all you

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:37,200
need to do because I find so many people

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,450
overvalue their work and when I say that

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,050
I don't mean that they over value their

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,849
expertise but a lot of people that are

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,470
that are especially new in the WordPress

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,180
community that want to build websites or

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,830
other people and you know there might

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,060
not even be a full developer maybe it's

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,319
what I like to call it integrator they

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,209
you know how to install plug-ins they

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
maybe know a little bit of CSS there

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,640
maybe make something look nice but

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,380
they're maybe not building something

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,940
from scratch but I talk to all these

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,650
people like oh yeah went out on my own

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,319
okay cool what's your average client

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,040
well I did two jobs last year I was like

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,870
okay great

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,760
yeah one was for five thousand one is

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,230
for fifteen thousand okay why is it all

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,600
you did oh well I talked to all these

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,160
people that couldn't afford me you know

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,750
I have a minimum five thousand dollars

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,630
or I have a minimum ten thousand dollars

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:24,540
so I have a minimum $20,000 bid and I'm

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,920
like kay but you're not busy and I hear

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,620
this I've heard this from hundreds and

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,810
hundreds of people is they think they're

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,970
up here but they're not keeping their

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,079
pipeline full so I talk to all these

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,570
people they say oh great how long does

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,980
it take you to make it get a project you

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,870
know it takes me about four months to

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,730
really find one quote one and close one

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,470
and then I have to do the project that

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,480
keeps me busy for two months and then

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,650
another four months so I'm like okay and

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,060
how much you're getting for this project

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,500
so ten thousand dollars and they're

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,109
really proud of themselves that they

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,579
sold a ten thousand dollar project but

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,500
when you break it down they're not

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,310
making the money that they need for the

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,569
effort so I say we verse it I've talked

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,290
to people that are doing this full-time

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,420
now what if you sold a 500 all their

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,280
website to 200 people and I walked

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,359
through how to do that on the later

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,120
slides it's very very easy to get people

00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,500
at this level now the caveat is you have

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,750
to make sure you're pricing your product

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,239
accordingly with our expectations you

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,349
can't sell a 60 hour project at 500

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,240
bucks that just doesn't make any sense

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,530
but you know how many people are just

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,510
fine but something that would take you

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,400
honestly two hours to do with someone

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,680
templates and themes and page builders

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,240
that are out there honestly at the end

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,820
of the day you need to get your

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,920
portfolio full and you need to get where

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,050
the money is if you're wasting all your

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,430
time trying to get to the five thousand

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,210
twenty thousand dollar projects and

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,510
you're not keeping yourself busy you

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,640
know

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,900
$100,000 is very attainable and I know

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,240
that you know as though it's kind of

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,980
funny you look at this but it's it

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,170
really kind of makes it easy because 200

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,030
people when you break it down is not

00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,890
that much one five hundred dollar

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,670
project every business day is a hundred

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,620
and thirty thousand dollars a year and

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,210
yes you know you might not get that day

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,550
one but we kind of talked about some

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,670
tools and ways that you can kind of do

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,440
that so with that I am not saying that

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,060
if you were able to sell a ten thousand

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
dollar project consistently that you

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,540
should not do that you should definitely

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,550
do that and you can still quote that

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,530
stuff because I usually find the people

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,150
when they start they need to start low

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,260
and they need to get portfolio stuff and

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,600
they need to get a lot of good happy

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,840
customers and then when their knowledge

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,420
and their portfolio goes up maybe they

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,430
start charging a thousand or 1500 and it

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,020
starts to scale accordingly but they at

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,610
the end of the day if you're not full

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,590
with work just just get the work and if

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,290
you know how if you get your processes

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,970
done right it won't take you that long

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,040
to be able to turn these things out

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,980
correctly and then at the end of the

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,050
year you'll have 200 customers you can

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,060
refer people to and then when you bid

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,250
maybe the 10 a $50,000 project you're

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,530
not wasting 20 hours in meetings and

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,420
discovery for something that doesn't get

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,460
there but it display I got to the point

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,750
where at the agencies we were in and

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,370
even when I was freelancing before I

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,890
took this job if somebody called me for

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,670
a complex project I would charge them

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,020
discovery time I would charge them

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,270
$5,000 before I even gave them a bid on

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,760
some of our higher projects I did when I

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,860
was later because I had that value and I

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,500
could justify it with my experience but

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,840
if you don't have that just get the work

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,970
money in the bank is better than hopes

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,950
and dreams later on and what's funny

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,660
about this is when you have the work the

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,060
other issue that a lot of people have is

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,370
they don't change their price they they

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,680
under they under charge when they have a

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,249
huge backlog of work every time I've

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,899
raised my

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,339
price when I've had a full backlog of

00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,829
work when I was trying to do this as

00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,209
more like a full-time thing before I got

00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,219
my day at my dream job would be in a

00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:53,279
community guy every time I raise my

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:54,989
price I got more clients but that was

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,879
because I had that backlog of all of

00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,619
those projects hundreds of projects

00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,569
behind me so it's definitely a game

00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,609
there's a great video that I recommend

00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,649
on YouTube it's called Effie you pay me

00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:06,449
except it's not edited it does have a

00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,789
lot of language but it's by Mike Minh as

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,289
Adi it's creativemornings and it talks

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,459
about contracts and that's an important

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,199
thing is make sure you have contracts

00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,479
and at the end of the day make sure you

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,669
talk about communication you know start

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,169
low don't get an ego that's what I

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,709
always tell people because so many

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:25,529
people honestly have an ego and they

00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:28,319
feel like they're wasting their time and

00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,329
effort because they're giving out these

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,969
projects for 500 or a thousand dollars

00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:37,259
or whatever it is you know who doesn't

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:40,349
have an ego Wix comm Squarespace Weebly

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,689
they're perfectly happy to take the

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,209
money and guess what they have a process

00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,649
that works for a lot of people but you

00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,589
need to be clear there's a great book by

00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,209
Nathan Ingram he's from i-team's and he

00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,709
does a lot of business consulting and

00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,299
it's like dealing with problem clients

00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:58,069
or his stuff is Bill his books called

00:07:54,299 --> 00:08:03,239
building fences around friendly monsters

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:04,799
where a client is just it's a monster

00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,619
but you need to build fences around it

00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:09,029
such as expectations so when your client

00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,729
emails you at two o'clock in the morning

00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:14,699
if you respond even though you happen to

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,619
be up anyway right away that sets that

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,449
expectation at oh you're a variable at

00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:20,939
two o'clock in the morning instead of

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,669
setting a reminder to have it auto reply

00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,619
in the next business day right now well

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,819
all my clients that I have currently

00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,639
even though they're I've had them

00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,519
previously they all know I am NOT 24/7

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,800
and I am NOT available when they need me

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,389
any requests they have has a minimum one

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,029
week turnaround because I'm on the road

00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:41,129
180 days a year and they're okay with

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,169
that other people might not be okay with

00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,029
that but I set those expectations clear

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,709
and you also need to set expectations

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,620
about what they're buying

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:52,170
clearly there are plenty of people that

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,209
are perfectly happy with five page

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,050
websites at 100 bucks a page there's a

00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,540
company

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,790
in Atlanta called one week website and

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,500
they charge between 100 to 400 dollars

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,170
per page and a lot of people despite two

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,019
or three pages from them and they

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,330
actually were a big sponsor at WordCamp

00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,649
Atlanta a couple of weeks ago in motion

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,029
hosting has something called website

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,620
quick starter where they'll build you a

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,470
one-page site within two business days

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,350
for $99 flat and it's selling really

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,390
well because there's a need for those

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,279
types of clients and if you can sell

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,380
higher please do but a lot of people are

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
having trouble filling that pipeline and

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,700
getting enough portfolio work to be able

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,500
to move themselves up that ladder so

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,790
when you sell a website make sure you're

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,079
being clear of what they're buying

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,490
you know you've they're bought you know

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,079
if they're if you're selling a $500

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,029
project or a thousand dollar project say

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,860
hey you're behind you you know I got I

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,350
got thirty templates you can pick from

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,300
have a need to see you can pick it from

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,740
a template and we'll edit this amount of

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,390
content you have to provide the content

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,100
and if you don't but be very clear about

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,079
what you're providing because this if

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,390
you're not very clear ahead of time

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,490
you're gonna get sucked in changes and

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,690
waste all your time and this plan won't

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,420
make any sense because then you're

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,010
spending 40 hours on a $500 project you

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,350
have to be extremely clear with these

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,430
clients on what they're buying a lot of

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,250
people are okay with that the same

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,600
reason why Wix Weebly and Squarespace is

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,640
taken away from WordPress market share

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,350
of every single year WordPress is

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,779
growing over the overall CMS business

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,970
but Wix Weebly and Squarespace are

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,740
selling these $40 a month plans that

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,329
people are more than happy to buy and

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,770
there's nothing wrong with Wix Weebly

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,810
and Squarespace those tools are actually

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,970
pretty phenomenal from an end-user

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,620
perspective they would just wanted a

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,410
website that's pretty and it got online

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,760
and it does that but you can help them

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,709
provide that but have them own it

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,660
because eventually those clients are

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,010
going to be successful hopefully and

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,690
they're gonna need more than the

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,920
limitations that those platforms provide

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,380
and then they're gonna get sticker shock

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,790
when they realize they can't do X Y or Z

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,520
and you have to rebuild a project from

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,680
scratch and then it's gonna be 5 or

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,329
$15,000 what's also nice about these

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,899
small clients is you can nurture them as

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,760
they grow you can sell maintenance

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,130
packages you can sell updates things

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,060
like that but there were three main ways

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,350
I recommend people get projects B&I

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,140
referrals and chambers of commerce

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,840
anyone

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,130
I've been a member or member of B and I

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,820
okay I did it does it work for you or

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,260
did work for you

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,980
Gold's anyone I have a bad experience

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,140
with a BNI group no business network in

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,120
international it is a lead exchange

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,490
group that meets every week and there's

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,650
only one person per category so like one

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,900
website designer one insurance agent one

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,430
realtor and you pass leads back and

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,800
forth on a weekly basis there are

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,290
thousands of them across the world and

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,060
it's probably like seven in Hamilton if

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,920
I was gonna guess and I would the BNI

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,870
website because there's a lot in every

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,360
city I've ever been to the issue with

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,370
being AI is they're so good they're

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,930
basically big cliques of people talking

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,270
and if you don't fit in with that

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,550
specific VI group that might not be the

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,470
be nigh group for you I had a visit like

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,670
seven BNI chapters before I found one

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,380
where I felt comfortable with the other

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,560
members but what's cool about Pinay is

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,120
you can visit any chapter once for free

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,300
so gonna be an I visit a chapter and

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,500
when it's all about giving that's what I

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,270
like about being I it's all about giving

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,890
out other information to people you're

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,690
not trying to get leads from people

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,090
you're trying to give leads to other

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,250
people but also have them know about you

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,810
so when I was in being I I did

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,520
everything I could to give leads to

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,590
everyone else as much as I could and

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,510
that was noticed so they would try to do

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,940
the same thing instead of just saying

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,520
what what did I get this week I was like

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,690
oh well I met someone who needs wedding

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,580
photography and I know a photographer

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,710
and I'd give them that lead or whatever

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,270
it is but again it's yet to be very

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,680
specific with the group and find the one

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,390
that works for you also be and I only

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,730
works if you can commit to it it's a you

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,620
have to go every single week we can't go

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,990
you have to have a substitute or get

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,000
kicked out of the group it's a very

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,320
structured group but it does work I talk

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
to a lot of people that don't like being

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,730
I because they're like well I went once

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,130
and I didn't get any leads after like a

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,320
couple months be and I also I found

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,940
takes about six months depending on the

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,530
cost to your service to really get a lot

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,180
of good leads but to lower your price

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,470
point the more leads you'll get because

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,590
people are more willing to take a risk

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,150
on you know passing a lead on a $500

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,430
project versus like a fifty thousand

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,230
dollar project chambers of commerce

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,850
anyone here part of their local Chamber

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,630
of Commerce or order II or anything like

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,660
that yeah anyone here that finds those

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,980
networking groups are useful to them

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,910
okay anyone here that find like those

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,850
local chambers or now

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,650
working things aren't useful to them

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,190
okay great so chambers of commerce are

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,900
very similar

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,000
I love chambers of commerce but there

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,320
are so many in every region find one

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,430
that works for you become a member and

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,810
become active in those memberships it's

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,910
when I used to attend Chambers of

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,680
Commerce I said what I would do back oh

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,110
hey my name is bah bah bah what do you

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,000
do and then they would tell me what they

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,560
do and then I'll be like hey I'm

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,870
thinking my mind how can I sell them a

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,400
website how can I sell them a website oh

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,530
you're a plumber great do you have oh

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,230
you know and I would instantly go back

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,910
to how can I sell them something instead

00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,320
of saying how can I add value to you and

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,960
then a really good friend of mine John

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,370
Rampton I mean he was rated by Time

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,750
magazine as one of the largest Twitter

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,360
influencers he's like 2 million

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,220
followers he writes for Time Newsweek

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,760
ABC all those major publications he's

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,370
like demo I give out as much people as

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,780
much as I can and it that's how I get

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,310
all my business and these clothes

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,420
multi-billion dollar companies all this

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,760
stuff and he's like I've done the math

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,040
every 10 people that I helped will equal

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,150
this much value in revenue every hundred

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,860
people that I helped will equal this

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,300
much value in revenue in every thousand

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,520
people equal a million dollars of

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,530
revenue you know those are his rough

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,660
numbers so that's how my philosophy is

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,340
is on web Ventures I'm on commissioned

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,660
if someone wants to talk to me about how

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,430
we can maybe help them with mis fiscal

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,020
perspective I'm happy to talk to them if

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,090
it works out great if it doesn't that's

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,920
fine if they just need to referral like

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,270
oh hey let me refer you to someone at

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,410
cPanel I think your product would be

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,660
really good at their conference I'm

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,950
gonna do that regardless because it's

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,020
going to be good for the brand and good

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,760
for me just by helping other people and

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,070
that's what I do in my evangelist job is

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,350
just try to help people as much as I can

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,580
and not try to sell our products because

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,890
at the end of the day that's gonna take

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,080
care of itself if you have a decent

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,960
product and/or service and you're just

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,640
nice you generally helping people people

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,530
who remember that and past year pass

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,790
your card and information around and

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,620
that's what chambers of commerce and

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,550
beam I come in really handy but for both

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,650
of those for me

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,690
it took six to 12 months of being really

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,850
active of Guinean before I was able to

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,980
reap those rewards back but what's

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,990
really nice about these is that be nine

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,050
chambers of commerce are so easy to sell

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,630
$500 projects to I know someone that was

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,810
in a you know a Toronto Sai as much a

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,430
Politan area and they joined their local

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,630
Chamber of Commerce abhi and I and

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,180
they're like hey we sell 500 all the

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,200
websites will have them in a week and

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,970
they show something they give like 20

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,030
examples like five page sites that are

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,040
basic template sites and they get orders

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,440
all day long they literally do one site

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,750
a week as I one side a day they do one

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,580
website a day and they're just getting

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,900
the orders because it's a good product

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,330
that people are willing to pay for it

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,940
think the dry cleaners the mom-and-pop

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,160
pizza shops these people that just want

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,690
something basic and then we're gonna go

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,010
to Wix or Weebly because they they saw

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,320
the Superbowl commercial but then

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,130
they're like oh I know this guy

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,810
500 bucks yeah the websites look fine

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,580
great I'll go with you and then you can

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,350
focus on kicking them out and if you

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,270
have a process that's able to have a

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,880
website that's done in under three hours

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,650
you're making pretty good money because

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,470
your work you're out you're billable

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:29,740
rates a little a little less than 150 an

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,330
hour at that point yeah a little bit

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,100
more than 150 an hour and that's a

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,660
pretty good billable rate and you're not

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
spending a lot of time acquiring it plus

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,590
then you can get the footer link on the

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,360
referrals that say hey site built by ABC

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,070
designs please click here and you can

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,200
also automate some of this process and

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,350
have just order forms on the website but

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,120
you have to be clear on what you're

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,120
buying if you're doing these low end

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,010
stuff and if you are already able to see

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,690
consistently sell thousand dollar

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,480
projects and keep yourself busy great

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,670
keep doing that and then push for $1,500

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,290
and then push for 2,000 but if you're

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,200
not able to consistently able to fill

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,000
your funnel start lower just to build

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,920
the base it's not saying you have to be

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,570
there forever but I've never once had a

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,360
client get mad be like well you changed

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:14,620
your prices yep I did and if you want to

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,300
keep working with me this one's gonna

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,850
cost in fact I've had clients been at

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,320
certain companies that you know we just

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,990
didn't like working with and we would

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,420
change the rates just for them they'll

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,410
be like you know it's just not you know

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:32,100
our new rates 200 bucks an hour but it

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,870
was 150 before yep but for you it's 200

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,080
well I don't want to pay that well

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,550
that's fine I can recommend someone and

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,990
more often than not I've been surprised

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,640
at people have been like well I want to

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,900
keep working with you well that's what's

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,460
gonna cost to keep working with us

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,200
because you're just building these small

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,220
projects you interviewing clients and

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
you're not stuck in these law

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,030
relationships I can't tell me the amount

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,309
of times I've taken larger projects

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,750
because it was $5,000 and I was poor and

00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,179
I was excited got a five thousand dollar

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,549
project that ended up sucking away three

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,980
months of my life and I hated every

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,860
second of it because there was $5,000

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,830
but when I started when doing the low

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,450
end stuff the clients were happy and it

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,370
only takes ten of them to equal the same

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,700
five thousand dollars and I was happier

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:23,860
at the same time and then I had the

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:26,770
secret weapon to all this is sorry those

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,409
a weird break the CVA weapon all this is

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,450
hosting who sells hosting for their

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,159
clients okay who lets their hosting

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,860
other clients to use their own hosting

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,440
yeah here's my biggest recommendation is

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,059
I don't like selling hosting the clients

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,120
directly because I find that gives you

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,919
in a very weird support support middle

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,480
ground unless you're doing consistent

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,460
work for that client if you're just

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,650
handing over a one-off site and then you

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,080
do the hosting first of all I hate the

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,880
annual billing letter of oh here's my

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,250
invoice for the yearly hosting and then

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,020
have to try to drag the money out of

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,059
these clients that's the bad part about

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,190
low end clients is they're not the best

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,200
at paying their bills for renewals on

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,520
the hosting and I just hated dealing

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,580
with hold a billion on that plus they

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,320
call you for every little question even

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,000
if it's not something that's inside your

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,710
support now if you're selling matrons as

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,570
a service and like with matrons plans

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,799
that's something you can add on and then

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,210
that's a different story but if you just

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,580
sign the website and passing it off let

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,230
them get their own hosting but get an

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,289
affiliate account at a host you like or

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,880
trust I've never nope I've never once

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,559
had a client not take the hosting I

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:35,320
recommend across thousands of clients

00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:36,640
ever and a standard shared hosting

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,110
account where you get a 20 percent

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,000
commission on shared hosting on a

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,460
seventy five dollar annual hosting plan

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,870
for two hundred sites a year you get

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,000
three thousand dollars in affiliate

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,620
revenue your first year six thousand

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
dollars in affiliate revenue your second

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,010
year nine thousand dollars in affiliate

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,539
revenue your third year because their

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,950
compounds because you get more clients

00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,929
each and every year now that these

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,970
doesn't figure in attrition you have to

00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,230
figure in probably a five to ten percent

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,870
attrition rate if you're looking at

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,000
averages but for basic numbers

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:07,809
here also you could go after a managed

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,460
hosting plan like well I put most of I I

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,710
used to put my clients on a fifty dollar

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,010
a month plan that I got fifty percent

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,350
commission on and at scale it works out

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,820
I make a good part-time income just on

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,150
those hosting referrals for clients I

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,410
haven't touched any years your for

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,480
twelve thousand dollars here five

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,070
fifteen your six eighteen years seven

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,350
twenty one year eight twenty four and

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,059
the more you add the more compounds

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,920
because everyone needs hosting they

00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:34,780
don't know where to go if you find a

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,550
host that you trust and recommend that

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,970
will work well with how you work with

00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,940
how your your workflow is this is your

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,740
secret weapon because clients don't care

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,420
about affiliate links you have to let it

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,950
you should let them know that you get a

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,780
little bit so here's how I worded cuz

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,800
some country like in the US you have to

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,210
let them know if it's an affiliate link

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,890
legally I say hey I recommend XYZ host

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,080
in motion hosting I really recommend it

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,080
for these five reasons and hey please

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,790
use my link and just so you know I do

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,740
you know my price can be so low in the

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,510
building because this helps me subsidize

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,320
some of that it doesn't change your

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,990
price at all

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,460
most people like sure but because they

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,410
buy the hosting themselves you know what

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,720
happens the host gets all the calls of

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,850
this isn't working or that isn't working

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,620
or my websites down on my website was

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,120
hacked your host gets to be the bad guy

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,370
that says yeah you didn't update

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,640
WordPress and you got hacked and that's

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,800
your fault you know and it's so nice to

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,780
just wash your hands of all of that mess

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,950
now if you're selling maintenance plans

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,679
and you want to sell hosting you

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,300
definitely can but I just I find it

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,160
wasn't worth the hassle at those lower

00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,770
end clients and the hiring clients I

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,480
didn't want to take the risk so I would

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,190
recommend a host and these are always

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,600
hosted good relationships with so I

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,030
could like call support and they knew

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,260
who I was or whatever but this is such a

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,970
good way to get you know get some

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,929
residual income that a lot of people

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:01,300
don't ever think about and then the last

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,820
thing I want to kind of talk about was

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,160
community online so there's so many ways

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,440
you can get leads so this is a link to

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,000
our user group on bold grid it's not

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,440
just football good users is free it's

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,140
what WordPress user it is it is on the

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,200
book of faces so I apologize about that

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,430
if you're not a facebook person

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,030
but if you don't do facebook join the

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:24,760
WordPress slack also go to Joomla

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,890
meetups go to Apple meetups everyone's

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,600
like but I'm a WordPress person yes you

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,760
can make so much freaking money

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,920
I hope at a WordPress at a at another

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,660
CMS's project these you'll meet these

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,150
people that are diehard about Drupal and

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,500
Joomla and they don't want to touch

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,240
those projects and sometimes those

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,770
clients just want a wordpress site and

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,260
they don't want a Joomla Drupal site

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,840
well guess what you can be that guy or

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,940
that girl that they recommend and you

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,760
can be the same and sometimes they

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,680
change when I started getting Jojo sunny

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,390
here at a wordpress event he would never

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,090
touch anything but two-month act his

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:01,570
name was Joe Joomla and Joe did he just

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:04,480
rebrand yeah and you now doing WordPress

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,950
stuff as well right see and you can also

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,270
bring people into the fold now he's a

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,590
competitor so if we don't like it as

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:13,870
much but but seriously just when you

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,310
meet people and you help people they'll

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,470
give it back to you because sometimes

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,590
people like to see him as a choice and I

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,030
don't care what CMS you use well I'm not

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,860
gonna say WordPress is the best or the

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,620
worst or anything because a tools are

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,070
tools just don't be one that's literally

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,740
my tagline because maybe you can build

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,910
the same site in five different ways the

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,920
workflow that works for you

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,150
I like WordPress that's cool it's

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,370
amazing keep doing it but there are

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,690
people that don't that's okay but they

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,270
will have people that need that

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,240
WordPress expertise and you can be that

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,910
person also go to other just you know

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,770
startup events in Minnesota there's a

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,140
bunch of there's a bunch of events just

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,210
for new businesses you know they gave

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,530
you know when they register in the state

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,660
you can get a list of who's a new

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,040
business go to those cocktail hours who

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,900
the Chamber's or other networking group

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,730
because you can meet so many cool people

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,910
that just need your product or service

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,370
the work is out there Denver did a study

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:12,340
this is about four years ago sixty-five

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:16,180
percent of businesses in Michigan don't

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,140
have any web presence at all period

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,120
sixty-five percent of all businesses and

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,550
in Michigan don't have any web presence

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,880
at all not a Facebook page not a Google

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,530
page not anything and these are these

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,950
are small mom-and-pops these are people

00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,059
that are working

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,710
out of their homes that need to be

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,720
online because we live in a world that

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,750
if you don't live online you don't exist

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,480
and I firmly believe that open source

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,549
and democratizing publishing is a right

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,860
to be able to have people share their

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:47,409
voice and you have the power to change

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,850
and allow people to have their voice but

00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,230
you have to make it accessible for

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,049
people and you can get paid in the

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,269
process so please don't take any of this

00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,649
talk and think that I'm saying oh you're

00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,360
not worth the money and you know

00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:59,200
WordPress should be cheap I am NOT

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,210
saying that at all

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,100
charge what you're worth but only if

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,919
you're busy if you're not busy you need

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,570
to change something and you know then

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,730
when you start getting client referrals

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,169
you can start batching it up and a lot

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,820
of times these clients once they're

00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,440
successful after one or two years and

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,690
they have some money they'll remember

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,399
that you were helpful they'll remember

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,740
and maybe when they need a full project

00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:22,059
like a custom project you're gonna be

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,159
that person that's been there every step

00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:25,480
of the way so charge them those

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,980
additional things and you can still do

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,100
the low-end websites if you want hire

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,500
somebody hire someone for 10 15 bucks an

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,269
hour for 10 bucks an hour have them make

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,159
websites in a few hours they can learn

00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,679
WordPress in the process you're still

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,210
making good money and that's where I

00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,789
think the biggest Achilles heel with

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,789
these freelancers are is they just they

00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,940
just care too much about their ego quite

00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:51,070
frankly and they'll they'll defer making

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,440
money until they get a project that

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,880
makes them validate their self-worth but

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,159
at the end of the day you need to make

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,710
money to pay your bills otherwise you

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:03,309
need to be doing something else so that

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,600
is kind of the end of this talk I do

00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:07,320
have about ten minutes for questions

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,309
because we do we have a 15 minute

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,590
transfer period between the talks

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:13,090
because I believe 45 minutes so does

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,870
anyone have any questions comments death

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,870
threats anything

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:30,300
there you go and and and by the way just

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,130
keep doing a lot of talks take a bunch

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:39,780
of 20s and never give it back you're

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:42,780
fine yeah I used to yeah there was a

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,610
service I used the API on called I need

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,950
articles that would write content for me

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:50,250
through an API and I would double that

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,220
fee so they charged $1 for 400 words I

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,410
would charge $2 for 400 words now I had

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,290
it automated in a process that worked

00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,420
out okay in the beginning but then when

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,240
I ended up doing is I found a copywriter

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,130
I really trusted and I would just refer

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,110
people to them if they didn't have

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,000
content on their own and then he would

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,200
give me website leads and we just kind

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,730
of dealt with it that way instead of

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,490
trying to he said put it in the project

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,900
bids but it was really hard you know it

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,340
was just easier to say you don't have

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,950
you're not gonna get your content ready

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,600
to me just go talk to the go talk to Bob

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,730
I recommend him and he would just do the

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,170
same for me but I did try to automate it

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,750
for the really really low end stuff for

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:32,490
a while with one of those copywriting

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:36,390
services and it was fine but it you know

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,620
it just it it's so hit or miss because

00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,650
you don't know we're gonna get to get it

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,720
back so if the client you know you can

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,100
say all day long that you pay for it and

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,170
you get what you get but at the end of

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,610
the day the client still needs to be

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,290
happy with the content although funny

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,900
story is I used corporate up some as my

00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,130
go to default lorem ipsum I can't tell

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,870

know you would do that I didn't it's

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,640

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,179

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:13,059

works the best for companies so yeah I

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,250
used to use back to the future hips um

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840
and then that also name rip the

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,490
corporate if some sounds real enough

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,169
especially for like banks and stuff that

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,419
people think it's like kind of

00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,780
