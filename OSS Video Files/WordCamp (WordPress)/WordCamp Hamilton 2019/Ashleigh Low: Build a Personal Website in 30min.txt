thank you all right good morning

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,759
everybody thank you for having me and

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,760
thank you for attending this short

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,650
presentation just as Kathy mentioned

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,550
I've only been familiar with WordPress

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,800
since about February so I am using kind

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,080
of the new Gutenberg format that's what

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,179
I learned on so what we'll be going

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,520
through today are just kind of the bare

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,440
essentials of three of the main pages

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,480
that you need for each of your websites

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,370
whether that's for services or you're a

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,190
small business owner or you know

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,550
organizing meetings that's what we'll be

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,610
going through so goal for the day again

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,930
is just to one decide what pages you

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,680
might need for your individualized

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,930
website to the content that's required

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,680
on each of those pages as kind of more

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:03,510
of a bare-bones and 3.how Guttenberg can

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,799
help us accomplish this okay so these

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,110
are the topics that we're going to be

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,090
covering today on our homepage we will

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,060
address titles how we're going to add

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,189
kind of some cover cover images or

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,009
background images and then we're going

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,460
to talk about static versus dynamic home

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,590
pages after that we'll kind of go into

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,840
the about page everybody wants to know a

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,729
little bit about you in this day and age

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,610
or a little bit of it the product or

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,930
service that you're going to be offering

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,479
again we'll just kind of cover how to

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,310
add content on that page and then the

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,439
last page one of the most important

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,150
pages it's going to be our contact page

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,610
so we're gonna learn how to add a

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,890
physical address that you know looks

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,229
nice as clean as presentable so people

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,350
are able to find you how you're going to

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,720
embed a map so people can find you and

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,579
then again just a contact form so if

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,729
anybody has questions or inquiries they

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,320
can get in touch with you that way okay

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,060
so first thing is going to be titled so

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,399
the what we're going to be looking at

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,190
today are a number of screenshots from a

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,770
template called Radcliff - on WordPress

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,930
com

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,730
I know some of you will be building on

00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,830
wordpress.org so we'll kind of talk

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,630
briefly but the differences between the

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,420
two and what's offered for around

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,310
different block types so with AD title

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,990
at the top of each of your web pages

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,850
you're going to have the opportunity to

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,160
add a title so you can just kind of

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,790
welcome people or you know add in what

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,380
you want always important to remember to

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,840
update any new information that you're

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,790
putting in is wildly frustrating when

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,500
you add a lot of content and then forget

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:44,250
to save it so weird camp 2019 that's

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,250
just a title of what we're doing today

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,930
okay so on your home page when you start

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,300
adding content you're gonna have these

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,160
pre-existing blocks that are present and

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,140
they will kind of show up with the light

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
gray writing if you bring your cursor

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,160
over to the readers left you're gonna

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,350
get a little addition sign that pops up

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,970
what you're gonna do then is just simply

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,370
click on the addition sign which is

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,320
gonna add a block and the blocks you can

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,750
just start to choose from a paragraph

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,020
block to add content you can choose

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,430
photos you can choose slideshows but for

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,640
now we're just gonna briefly touch on

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,010
the paragraph block so you're gonna add

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,230
in your content each time you're done

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,030
writing something if you press ENTER

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,190
it's automatically gonna start a new

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,170
paragraph block for you

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,670
one of the really I guess like

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,680
convenient things I found about

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,500
Guttenberg is again if you bring your

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,690
cursor over to the readers left you're

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,030
gonna get these arrows that show kind of

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,070
move up or move down so if you decide

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,780
you want to move blocks of content

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,600
around you don't have to cut and paste

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,160
it you can just simply click up or down

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,020
and it's going to reorganize the blocks

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,480
on your page for you pretty quickly and

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,420
pretty efficiently so that's kind of a

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,400
nice feature okay background or cover

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,630
image this is where you guys get a

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,570
chance to capture your audience's

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,420
attention I've been told in the past

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,820
that having original content is usually

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,430
the best there are websites out there

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,500
where you can pull different photos for

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,480
free sometimes the photographers who

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,549
upload them just ask for a thank you but

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,049
those are always an option if we don't

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,680
you know have a lot of time to go out

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,210
and take

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,310
what we need to do so to add a photo

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,110
what you're gonna do is at the top of a

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,539
paragraph block or any pre-existing

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,820
block on the page there's going to be

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,560
again another addition sign just at the

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,320
top you're going to bring your cursor

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,360
over that addition sign and here's where

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,900
you're gonna find different blocks to

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,810
use so in this for this case we're just

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,610
gonna click on the cover block what's

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,620
gonna come up is something that looks

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,110
like this so you can either choose to

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,509
upload an image directly from your

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,910
desktop or if you've already uploaded

00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:00,669
all of your content onto wordpress.com

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,550
or wordpress.org they have a library

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,259
there that you can just select from with

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,509
this you can also choose if you want

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,949
your cover image to be the full width of

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,870
the page if you want it to be a little

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,880
bit smaller you can kind of choose if

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,750
you want it to be left or right that's

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,610
helpful too so this is what it's going

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,639
to look like initially when you upload

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,500
your cover image again with the cover

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,470
image you do have the ability to add

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,110
text over top of the photo for this

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,909
example I'm not sure why the words came

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,430
up gray because when it's published they

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:36,220
come up white but you can add whatever

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,720
text you want over most cover images if

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,849
you don't want to add text and you just

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,130
want to have a really nice big bold

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,470
visual there you can do that too so

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,190
again we're gonna save it and then we're

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,199
always gonna preview before you publish

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,479
so then this is what you know a cover

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,220
image would look like in the the preview

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,050
mode so you can see you have all of your

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,840
tabs across the top for your web page

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:04,080
you have you know your title and then

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,970
you have the cover image underneath okay

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,130
any questions so far is everybody doing

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:14,889
okay yeah okay so next part is blog

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,110
posts so this is where we're going to

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,229
touch on having a dynamic versus a

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,090
static page if you do want to have more

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,380
of a dynamic homepage for your readers

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,199
or if you're into blogging or

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,870
photography there is the option to have

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,940
your all of your new posts or all of

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,599
your new blog posts come up on your home

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,939
page if you prefer more of

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,580
a dynamic homepage as opposed to just a

00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,149
static homepage so what you're gonna do

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,699
here is if you go click on the top left

00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,979
onto my site you're gonna get this menu

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,529
that comes up on the readers left-hand

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,419
side so here what you can do is kind of

00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,300
click into pages and all of your blog

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,439
posts are going to be listed there

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,240
alternatively if you just want to look

00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,089
at your posts by themselves you can

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,679
select the post post tab underneath

00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:05,629
their pages and just go in and do it

00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:07,430
that way so let's look at one more thing

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,729
so if we were to click on posts from

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,909
this page what happens is that we have

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,240
the option to add a blog post from here

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:21,020
so this is where we can add a blog post

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,669
if we want to make our homepage dynamic

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,289
so we want our homepage to kind of

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,419
showcase all of the blocks that we've

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,519
been doing what you're gonna do is come

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,069
down to the customizer which is a little

00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,139
bit below that and within customizer

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,789
you're gonna have the option for home

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,149
page settings okay

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,279
once you click on homepage settings it's

00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,449
gonna bring you to this option so here

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,089
is where you can choose to have your

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:47,389
home page as a static page or you can

00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:49,879
kind of select just up here and choose

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:54,219
to have it as a dynamic page and choose

00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,219
to have your blog post show up there

00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:03,010
it'll make sense okay

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,140
so that kind of concludes a little bit

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,630
on the homepage we talked to them adding

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,880
content adding a cover page and then

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,630
deciding if we want it to be static or

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:17,530
dynamic next we're gonna kind of go into

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,510
a boat and very briefly we're just going

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,420
to show you guys how to add some photos

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,190
as opposed to just a cover image so here

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,760
what you're gonna do is you are gonna

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,770
highlight that addition sign on the

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,950
readers left again what's gonna pop up

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,870
is this menu here so within this you

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,630
have you know the option for images the

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,300
options for gallery which is a gallery

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,990
is just static images or multiple static

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,390
images if you do search slideshow up

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,120
here you can choose to have a slideshow

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,860
on this page where you choose between

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,130
seven to five images and it'll just

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,030
nicely kind of flow through so that's

00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,610
how we add pictures and what it can look

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,680
like is if you just want to add you know

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,780
she's just a brief example from my own

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,400
is if you just you can choose different

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,310
blocks and choose where you want to put

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,930
pictures in again on the about page

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,580
you're also going to want to add some

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,010
content so just like we talked about

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:23,490
paragraph blocks before you can put them

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:26,050
in here as well okay now last page

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,580
contact page so we're going to go

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,110
through a couple of things here we're

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,720
gonna talk about how to put in an

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,150
address put in your maps and then put in

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,620
a contact form so readers are able to

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,280
send emails to you or your business

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,070
email directly so for addresses again

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,930
we're gonna highlight that edition sign

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,480
and then in the top here what you can

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,270
type in would just be like a contacts or

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,330
contact info what comes up is the option

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,790
to put in address email addresses or a

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,610
phone number so we're just going to

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,410
click on addresses and this is the box

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,270
that's going to come up here so for

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,970
today I just put in the address of

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,160
innovation part if you do have a small

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,610
business or a physical address this is

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,430
where you could enter that information

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,100
so we're gonna say

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,410
and then preview and then this kind of

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:24,920
comes up nice and concise here okay so

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:28,220
that's addresses any questions no okay

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,940
next one it's gonna be Maps this one is

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:35,480
a little bit tricky only because we need

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,730
to use a third party to get what do they

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,649
call it at a public access token in

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,089
order to embed the maps on our page so

00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:47,149
let's talk a little bit about that if

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,800
you're on wordpress.com your Maps are

00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,390
kind of automatically going to be

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,149
included in all of those different

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,910
blocks that you can select if you are

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,580
wordpress.org you may need to download

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,640
an application called jetpack in order

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,260
to have access to the maps I have heard

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,029
of a little bit of controversy with

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,430
downloading jetpack so would probably be

00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,800
best to ask one of the more experienced

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:13,580
WordPress users about this if you are

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,370
operating off of wordpress.org so we're

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,690
gonna select our maps at the same time

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,060
we're also going to open you know

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,170
another browser page and we're gonna go

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,170
to map box

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,930
okay so Matt box this is where you're

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,060
gonna get your free public access token

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,630
that's gonna allow you to embed the maps

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,310
onto your web pages so with Matt box you

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,529
don't have to pay anything to get this

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,529
public access token I believe you do

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:43,430
have to create an account but this kind

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:45,380
of a line of code across here this is

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,910
your public access token so what you're

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,650
gonna do you know once you make your

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,680
account and you're giving this on Matt

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,650
box you're just gonna copy this and then

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,529
go back to the maps on your web pages

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,329
and just paste it in once you do that

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,360
your Maps gonna show up quite nicely

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:04,459
just on your web page at that time

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,529
that's when you can kind of put in your

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,920
company address or your business address

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,950
there and again we're gonna save and

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,360
preview and then once we save in preview

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,310
what's going to come up is just a map

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,300
that looks like this with just a nice

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,110
kind of red

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:24,670
touken on the address so then once it's

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,670
published it'll look something like that

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,580
okay last bit here is going to be our

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,670
contact form so again you can kind of

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,470
see this is a jetpack application so

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,600
we're gonna click on the addition sign

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,130
we're gonna type in contact in our

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,640
search box and that's going to give us

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:47,300
the option there so we're gonna select

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,930
form once we select form this is what

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,970
you're gonna see come up this part here

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,820
where it says email address that's the

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,010
email address that you want your client

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,720
base or your customers to send it to so

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,000
if you have a separate email you know

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,320
that's just managing web traffic or if

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,269
you have a separate email that's just

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,730
for your business that's what you want

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,820
to go right in here

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,529
this part the subject line that can be

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,480
it can be anything you want I think when

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,130
I set mine up I just put in something

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,899
like web traffic so then when it does

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,880
come into my inbox I know what I'm gonna

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,829
be answering questions from patients who

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,570
have visited the website but that's just

00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:29,779
a nice way to be able to keep track of

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:31,490
stuff gonna again save and then you can

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,350
preview here and then this is what it's

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:37,779
going to look like when it's live on

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,779
your site just super simple contact form

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:48,940
right and that's that's it three pages

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,940
the other questions yeah

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:02,800
that's a good question um

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:08,070
this yep go ahead Shanta yeah the answer

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,070
is yes yes

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,010
this okay so this is I guess so there's

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,310
a wordpress that people used to use that

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,490
had kind of like I've been told a

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,230
different template this template where

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,970
you can kind of like select and choose

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,890
different blocks is is the Gutenberg so

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,990
I know one of the things that they're

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,150
working on is making it more kind of

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,990
like user friendly for beginners like

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:45,840
myself included the thing I found kind

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,460
of tricky when I first started and you

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,440
know lots to help from the people in

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,930
your volunteers in this room was just

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,060
like finding where everything is so I

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,160
was kind of hoping the purpose of today

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,290
would kind of help you guys navigate or

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,990
you know kind of kind of get a start on

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:09,030
things so this template that you're

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:11,480
using is Gutenberg questions how many

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:15,990
people are building their own website

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,490
yeah okay in the process or are we just

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,490
kind of doing regular updates

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,459
process

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,520
in the process of building your own

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:33,050
website yeah okay okay and everybody's

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,770
using WordPress I'm assuming because

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:42,680
you're here today

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:44,570
so what yeah go ahead yeah so oh sorry I

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,589
just asked if I was doing all of my own

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:51,110
updates yeah so mine I only launched

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,640
about two weeks ago one of the important

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,529
things to remember is that your website

00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,600
is always going to be in a

00:15:54,529 --> 00:16:00,770
work-in-progress you're always going to

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,990
be updating it and changing it so yeah

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,300
like I will update my own website but

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll also do it with the help of like

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,740
WordPress support so there you can email

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,300
them ask some different questions they

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,149
generally get back to you within the

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,220
same day but I have found that very

00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,570
helpful for just kind of going forward

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,570
because I don't have all the answers

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,520
okay so the question was do I have more

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,740
than three pages on my personal website

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,450
or a professional website the answer is

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,760
yes yeah

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,829
however these were the three that I

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,660
started with with Shanta because they

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:46,779
are kind of like the essentials or the

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,779
bare-bones to get started yeah what

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,069
okay so question was have I ever had to

00:16:54,439 --> 00:17:00,769
upgrade like I said like an old web web

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:03,079
worse our WordPress website - a new one

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:06,049
the answer is no I only started becoming

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:09,079
familiar with WordPress in a bit in

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:12,589
February so I kind of started going to

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,049
the and most Challenger cities will have

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,760
it where you have it's on Meetup or meet

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,649
up calm you can just kind of type in

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,140
WordPress and then wherever you're from

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:23,899
and generally once a month they'll have

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,399
like a two-hour free tutorial or you can

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,990
go and meet different WordPress

00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:29,750
volunteers and then they can kind of

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,510
help guide you or give you advice on

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,850
what you want to accomplish so I've only

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,720
been familiar with this kind of template

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,720
or this kind of format

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:48,330
yeah yeah yeah ping tape you see here

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,020
okay so here what you're gonna do is

00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,880
kind of in the readers top left you

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,220
would click on my site it's a little bit

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,820
cut off there and then what you're gonna

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,670
do is kind of scroll down to pages so

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,100
you can either add pages here by just

00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,770
pressing that little Add button or if

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,960
you go back to where it's you're just at

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,270
my site you'll have this option for

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,790
pages here if you just click on pages

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,730
all of this right here is gonna come up

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,120
so I think the pink button says add new

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,670
page just make sure your highlighted on

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,190
giraffes when you add new page because

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,260
if your site is already live you don't

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,030
want to add a new page to a live site

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,400
because then it's going to get a little

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,500
bit confusing and stressful so

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,600
everything that you do or at least how I

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,090
started all the pages I were working on

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,010
they were located in drafts until I was

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,770
happy with you know what they look like

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,050
how they functioned and then only after

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,490
that time did I publish them and once

00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,070
they're published they'll kind of show

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,290
up under this tab so in each of these

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,450
what you can do is you can just preview

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,970
them on their own and look at them while

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,980
your site is live but if you do want to

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,780
make edits to them while your site is

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,110
live I would suggest kind of doing it in

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,290
a draft mode just to be safe yeah no

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,290
worries

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
eyes

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,189
[Music]

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,419
all right

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,799
yeah yeah okay so hang tight with that

00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:44,429
if we go on this page if you go down to

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,429
customize so one of the things that I

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:50,309
found so for your whole site you can

00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:52,919
have the option to have it private where

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,440
only you can view it or you can choose

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,859
to go public so less everybody can view

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,669
it what I found is I was able to publish

00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:05,969
my pages and view them in the customizer

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,580
section while my entire site was still

00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:10,619
private so I got to kind of like test

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,629
and see how everything worked make sure

00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,999
you know like if I clicked on this tab

00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,499
it was directed to the correct page and

00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:19,499
once I could have found everything

00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:21,210
worked that way I was given instructions

00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:23,219
I don't remember how to do it but I was

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,440
able to change my privacy settings so

00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:27,349
that I just chose like everybody could

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,969
see it now and it wasn't just internal

00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:32,879
so you can do that kind of in the

00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:35,129
customizer section maybe like email

00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:36,629
WordPress for help before you start

00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:40,169
doing that just so you can make sure

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:45,799
that your privacy is it that is private

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,799
before you publish everything yeah yeah

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,059
yes

00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:00,400
hmm yeah I love to oh sorry for the

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,380
beginners in the room can you talk about

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,250
the difference between pages and posts

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:09,580
okay so if we look here pages are going

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:12,010
to be your web pages your home page that

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,260
captures your audience you're a boat

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,179
page that tells them all about you and

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,309
why they should like you or your product

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,580
your contact page where you can find

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:27,010
them posts are kind of like different

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,090
blog posts so say what do you do high

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:34,299
school teacher okay and what are you

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:38,230
creating a website for okay for what

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:39,909
purpose for students know their teachers

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:45,970
okay and what information do you want on

00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:48,130
it okay very cool so when you're doing

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,770
this kind of stuff I guess this would be

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,240
like a technology event that you I don't

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,520
know attended to learn a little bit more

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,770
if you wanted to post a bit that you

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,440
could create a post with some photos out

00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,539
of hey I went to like WordPress 2019 and

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,400
Hamilton this is what I learned you can

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:06,159
check it out a little bit and then that

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,909
would be a post on your blog so your

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,679
blog can have as many posts as you want

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:14,289
sidenote the more you blog and the more

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,020
you post the higher your SEO which is

00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:19,600
search engine optimization so the more

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,880
you post the more google likes your site

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,309
and will find you faster so any kind of

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,230
little events you attend

00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,909
you know perhaps like outside of school

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,190
or any maybe like tutorials that you

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:32,400
host with teachers or students those are

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,830
all little things that you can post as

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,710
like information nuggets that people can

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,830
just read about in your blog so blogs

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,890
kind of synonymous with posts I guess

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,929
where as pages are kind of like that raw

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,669
foundation of information that people

00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,830
are going to scroll through and look at

00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:56,020
that you want the website when you're

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:58,320
online that makes sense yeah okay yeah

00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,320
what's up

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:24,210
if you want to what sorry okay okay

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,790
there is I'm not sure where it is on

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,290
WordPress but there is a stats page

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,720
where you can kind of look up the

00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,630
statistics of how many people are

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,280
visiting each page or each post this

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,280
might be a good question for Shanta

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:52,950
we take that offline afterwards if you

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,950
want but there is usually a apartment

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,170
that's okay so yeah if you want to get a

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,510
little bit more information about that

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,490
or like which plug-in to use exactly

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,120
Shanta would be a great person to talk

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,790
to

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:12,990
once we wrap up anything else sir no

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,990
okay oh yeah of course

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,649
that

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,730
sorry she's first a little yeah

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,990
it's another way to mature

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,929
yeah so there are hundreds of themes to

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:12,380
choose from

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:14,760
unlike wordpress.com or wordpress.org

00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,010
some of them are gonna include like an

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,260
e-commerce option so if you are like

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,669
selling things online you're gonna want

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,309
to make sure you choose a template that

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:25,260
has that capability if you just want

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:27,960
something super simple like there's

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,750
there's lots of setups there one of the

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,370
interesting things though is if you do

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,019
want your page to look a little bit

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,929
different or you do want it tweaked a

00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,269
little bit if you email the WordPress

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,820
com for help what they'll do is they'll

00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:44,190
send you like a little bit of code that

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:48,090
you can kind of copy from the email and

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,409
I don't know if I have it up here if you

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,630
go a little bit further down here

00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:56,220
there's another little tab that says

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:58,679
like CSS so you would click on that CSS

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,950
tab and just paste the code that they

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,289
sent you from the email into that CSS

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,210
and it can kind of change change the

00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:08,549
setup of your template a little bit if

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,519
you find you know there's a template and

00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:14,549
you like 95% of it but you want it to do

00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,590
something minorly different they're

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:19,080
always really good at sending code for

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,179
you that can adjust that if you're not

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,960
like familiar with coding yourself which

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,590
I'm not super so that was helpful yeah

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,590
no problem

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
okay

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,559
or there's s

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,470
it is cracking but a little bit

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,720
okay

00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,769
my own page

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,889
check out the plugin meals is it really

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,480
super

00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:34,000
and I'll get through them and there's no

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,769
candy very complex but you'll see if I

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,769
spot for the Google code

00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:44,379
there are questions comments concerns

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,100
