Description: 
	Starting a blog changed my life not once, but twice. That was never my initial intention. It was meant to be a passion project that helped me rekindle that long lost love of writing.
I share the ups and downs of my blogging journey, the many mistakes I’ve made, what I’ve learned and where I am now (running a consulting business, an instructor at Sheridan College).
I’m a huge believer in sharing your story because you never know who is reading, who is watching and who is listening.
