Title: Karen Swyszcz: How Starting a Blog Changed My Life
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	Starting a blog changed my life not once, but twice. That was never my initial intention. It was meant to be a passion project that helped me rekindle that long lost love of writing.
I share the ups and downs of my blogging journey, the many mistakes I’ve made, what I’ve learned and where I am now (running a consulting business, an instructor at Sheridan College).
I’m a huge believer in sharing your story because you never know who is reading, who is watching and who is listening.

thank you

00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,069
[Applause]

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,380
good morning everyone can everyone hear

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,330
me okay just want to make sure cuz I

00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,480
actually have a soft-spoken voice but I

00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,070
will try to project so thank you so much

00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,870
for choosing to attend my talk how

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,910
starting a blog changed my life

00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,520
so I know it kind of sounds like a

00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,140
cheesy after-school special but really

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,970
it has changed my life a couple times

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,340
for the better and it may not

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,690
necessarily be what you think so just to

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,130
kind of give you a little bit

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,690
foreshadowing it's very different from

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,880
what you might expect I'm not a

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,410
full-time blogger so I'm not like a

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,320
social media influence or anything like

00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:37,310
that so without further ado let's get

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,380
started so if you haven't searched me

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,180
online you're probably wondering who am

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,800
i who is this person and why is she

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,360
speaking at WordCamp so I like to share

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,960
with you who I was before I started

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,550
blogging so I have a degree in

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,649
biochemistry from the University of

00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:00,080
Waterloo I've gone through multiple jobs

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,979
multiple careers so pretty much anything

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,450
from project management to personal

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,820
training I even did a brief stint

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,950
working in retail I've applied to grad

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,900
school twice at one point I thought I

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,700
wanted to be a physiotherapist and then

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,860
another point I thought I wanted to do a

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,590
master's in food science but I actually

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,380
didn't end up doing either of those

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,570
things so just to let you know I'm not

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,610
even using my degree I consider it to be

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,870
an expensive piece of artwork hanging in

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,970
my parents living room so I've been

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,330
unemployed several times brother then

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,060
you know having a job set up for for the

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,709
next little bit I usually spent the time

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,420
being unemployed to trying to figure out

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,620
what I wanted to do with my life so

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,480
during that time which spanned over

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,030
almost ten years I was very confused

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,980
frustrated and lost I didn't know what I

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,170
was doing and it felt like everyone

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,000
around me my peers my friends and family

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,190
they were kind of on this upward

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,570
trajectory so their lives were getting

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,510
into place they were getting promoted

00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,489
and their jobs whereas I felt nothing

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,489
that I did was working out according to

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,919
plan so I felt I had started over

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,180
several times and I always like to tell

00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,270
people that instead of climbing the

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,620
corporate ladder I feel that my

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,290
career is more like a rock climbing wall

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,420
so if anybody has actually tried for 30

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,600
years and collected their pension and

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,970
it's all good and so initially I thought

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,540
it was good but I eventually fell back

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:34,330
into the same pattern of being lost

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:36,250
frustrated and confused so why I

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,590
actually started blogging was because I

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,510
was looking for ways to help fund my

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,720
wedding like so I was searching on how

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,340
to make money and starting a blog was

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
actually one of the results so it really

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,380
wasn't actually to start writing which

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,740
is more like how can I make some money

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,900
however so I started a personal finance

00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,550
blog called making the bacon and a lot

00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,260
of the times I get asked well how did

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,850
you come up with that name and to be

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,950
honest I have no idea I don't I don't

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,290
even remember but all I knew was that I

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:11,110
liked the name it's tucked and was fun

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,520
and yeah so I started it in 2012 and I

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,650
felt that there was a need for more

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,180
people to discuss the importance of

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,910
creating multiple streams of income

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,200
saving for a rainy day because a lot of

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,300
the conversations I was having with

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,830
people was that they seemed either very

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,930
afraid of money they didn't want to talk

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,760
about money or they seed or excuse me

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,220
they saw money as being a bad thing

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,080
which in fact we know it's not it can be

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,730
used as a tool and help can help provide

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,500
freedom and flexibility so what actually

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,010
ended up happening with that I didn't

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,690
make money right away but it ended up

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,830
being a really fun hobby so I really

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:52,540
enjoyed vlogging and I found that I was

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:54,070
able to develop some new skills and it

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,320
became a creative outlet to help

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,650
tolerate a job that was very boring and

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,650
repetitive

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:10,120
so I had a creative childhood growing up

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,670
I was very creative I wrote a lot of

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,590
poems and stories did all those things

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,000
like to doodle and draw and do lettering

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:24,640
however I was never encouraged to take

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,990
these things seriously I also did well

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,310
in English class and then my OSC English

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,110
teacher assumed that I was going to

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:37,180
pursue a degree in writing or something

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,250
related however I was led to believe

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,170
that pursuing a degree in science

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,620
engineering medicine would provide

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:47,080
better career opportunities so I was on

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,780
that path where you know go to get good

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,710
grades go to a school get a good job and

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,620
and you're set for life

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,580
so even though I mentioned I have a

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,520
biochemistry degree actually enrolled in

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,350
engineering first so I didn't do so well

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,870
in engineering and it was basically a

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,760
combination of being away from home for

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,510
the first time not getting along with my

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,810
roommate

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,340
having a crazy workload and having

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,000
trouble making friends so it's just kind

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,070
of this really massive big stress ball

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,420
and then so after not doing so well in

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,790
engineering I kind of felt like in a

00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,980
panic and to add more fuel to the fire

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,780
my parents were panicking for me so I

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,800
distinctly remember my mom saying like

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,630
what are you gonna do what are you gonna

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,710
do and then I'm like I don't know it's

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,390
like what are you gonna do and like I

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,030
don't know I'll go into science so

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,070
really it was just kind of a panic going

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,470
into science and in hindsight when I

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,730
think about it I probably should have

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,350
you know just taken some time off of

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,540
school or even earlier than that

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,550
probably have taken a gap year between

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,500
high school and engineering because I

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,300
feel at such a young age it's really

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,040
hard to figure out what you want to do

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,680
right we know especially in university

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,450
it's a lot about the theory I mean even

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,130
though I did a co-op program you know I

00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,630
had some experience working in the lab I

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,760
still felt it wasn't the same and it

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,650
wasn't until I was actually in the real

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,810
world you know going through several

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,320
jobs that I realized what I wanted to do

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,090
and then what I didn't want to do so all

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,270
I knew was that I didn't want to do any

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,270
research

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,690
so the blog brought back creativity into

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,850
my life so as I had mentioned earlier as

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,610
a kid I like to write poems and stories

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,300
and I found that blog rekindling my love

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,130
for writing and so many years had passed

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,050
where I was not really doing anything

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:38,430
creative and blogging was a way for me

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,889
to express my thoughts and feelings and

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,690
then I'm also an introvert so I feel I'm

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:50,590
better at expressing myself through the

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:52,360
written word versus speaking so blogging

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,790
is not just about the writing I found I

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,919
had developed a lot of skills so I was

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,340
continuously improving my communication

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,290
skills I was using social media to

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,120
network and market my blog and business

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,789
and when anything about your blog can

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,830
eventually become a business for you can

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,650
be presented with business opportunities

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,180
so you're thinking about things such as

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,440
negotiating rates what are the terms of

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,660
how you're going to get paid like

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:23,770
signing contracts so I did a lot of

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,270
networking online learned how to develop

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,090
an online presence how to build the

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,870
brand and as I mentioned it felt like I

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,300
was running a side business I learned

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,469
about creating a managing content and I

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,510
guess one of the most important skills

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,950
since we're at wordcamp was learned how

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,650
to use WordPress and it was quite

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,870
interesting back in 2012 so I just threw

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,400
it out there asked people what can I use

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,160
to blog like how would I start a blog

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,350
and really the unanimous answer was

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,839
WordPress I don't even recall anybody

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,850
mentioning Squarespace or Wix

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,260
at the time maybe they had to be honest

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,459
I'm not sure whether not they existed at

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,400
that time but maybe they weren't as

00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:02,350
popular as they are now so learned a bit

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,940
about WordPress you know how to use it

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,770
as a content management system learned

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,410
about what themes are how to choose a

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,640
theme plug-ins and then what certain

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:18,279
plugins you should use but of course it

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,760
wasn't all sunshine and roses so I made

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,440
a lot lot of mistakes

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,540
so I'd like to share with you some

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,220
things that I did wrong or I didn't do

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,199
right away so I was actually anonymous

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,339
for several years and it was one of

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,320
those things where I was scared because

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,449
I was working for the government but

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,459
even though I wasn't breaking any rules

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:41,440
in their social media policy and what I

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,690
was blogging about personal finance had

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,130
nothing to do with working for the

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,870
government I worked in food inspections

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,630
so as you can see there were two very

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,730
different categories but again I was

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,339
very afraid that people would you know

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,510
be very critical of my opinion and

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,800
they'd be wondering like what is she

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,050
talking about why is she talking about

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
this so even my friends and family they

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,959
didn't know about it except for my

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,820
sister and boyfriend at the time so it

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:08,589
was anonymous for about but I think

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,930
almost four years and I had really

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,550
really ugly stock photos so this was

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,199
before I knew about unsplash and I

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,850
wasn't consistent with posting and I

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,670
want to say when I wasn't consistent I

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,620
mean I was not inconsistent so there

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,079
would be one week where I post one or

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,269
two times and then several months would

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,769
go by and then I would post again and

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,680
though even though I was on social media

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,329
I wasn't even really promoting my

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,579
content that much I had this idea that

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,019
okay I published a post everyone's gonna

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,370
see it they're all they're all going to

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,569
come when we know that is not

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,800
necessarily the case when you're

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:49,269
starting a blog for the first time and

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,980
for another strange reason I thought I

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,170
didn't need any help and I thought I

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,000
could figure everything out on my own

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,519
and we know that's true in a sense you

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,290
know thanks to Google and YouTube but

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,240
again you have to think about what is

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,459
your time worth to you do you want to

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,930
spend hours upon hours googling

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,519
everything or do you want to you know

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,720
get some of those hours back and just

00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,519
ask somebody to help you okay so even

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,260
more things I did wrong and didn't do

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:19,209
right away so I didn't have any kind of

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,130
focus I I claimed to be a personal

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:23,589
finance blog but if you were to go back

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,810
way way back into my archives I actually

00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,730
blogged about pretty much anything and

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,649
everything there was one post where I

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,930
blogged about you know like Costco

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,699
shopping at Costco and then there was

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,230
another one where I blogged about travel

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,850
I blogged about

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,610
you know relationships I blogged about

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,450
careers so it wasn't specifically about

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,920
personal finance as I mentioned wasn't

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,770
that active on social media right away

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,660
and I didn't even do a lot of in-person

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:54,790
networking either which can be very

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:57,100
helpful to if you have a blog and I wish

00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,220
I had a screenshot to show you guys how

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,470
ugly my first site really was so I'm

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,360
sure the theme suburbia is completely

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,150
different now but back when I first

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,230
started it was very ugly this kind of

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,260
reminds me of some like old-school

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:16,390
wallpapers like yellow and just just not

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,010
very pretty so not only that I really

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,170
didn't put in the time and the effort so

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,080
I was more focused on trying to build a

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,000
career at my full-time position which

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,220
kind of makes sense so I felt like I had

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,870
too many things on the go and I really

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,940
wasn't planning on taking the blog

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:36,130
seriously until a few years after

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:38,290
working at my full-time job so it's

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,240
never a priority those want to talk

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,600
about how it actually changed my life

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,270
for the first time so with my government

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,100
job not only it was was it very boring

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,540
and repetitive it was getting to the

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,630
point where I wanted to quit my job

00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:00,010
every day so I'm not sure if anybody you

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,690
know has ever had that feeling when

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,380
they're just basically looking at the

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,930
clock every hour so that was me not only

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:12,820
that I actually started my job every day

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:15,670
at 6:30 a.m. 6:30 a.m. so guess what

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,970
time I woke up at 5:00 a.m. so it's just

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:24,460
basically me and the truck drivers on on

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,740
the road and during my time there I felt

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,730
like I had not gained any new skills I

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,140
was not being challenged my efforts at

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,230
the government agency they were not

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,120
paying off so what I tried to do was I

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,730
joined a like health and safety

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,290
committees I joined a career committee

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,600
for young employees that the government

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,360
I even created and facilitated a

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,190
workshop I had numerous interviews with

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,040
upper management and I did a lot of job

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,759
shadowing to

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,600
throughout what I wanted to do so when I

00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,430
realized nothing was changing despite my

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,120
efforts I decided to make a couple of

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,940
decisions that I would put more effort

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,380
into building the blog so as I mentioned

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,019
you're not being consistent I

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,610
I quit if I could if I had a dollar for

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,279
every time I quit the blog I probably

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,170
would have had you know a good lump sum

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,300
in my bank account now because I had

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,029
actually quit the blog a numerous amount

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,180
of times and then in 2015 I made the

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,230
conscious decision actually kind of

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,180
flipping the switch in deciding I'm

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,800
gonna actually put effort into this I'm

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,720
gonna you know almost treat it as a

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,459
part-time job like schedule time on

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,750
evenings and weekends

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:35,589
even during my lunch break to do

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:40,819
whatever I can to work on on the blog

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:46,550
and then I made another decision to

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:49,490
leave the government agency entirely so

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,440
through WordPress I discovered HTML and

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,470
CSS and then at one point I thought I

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,370
wanted to be a web designer or a web

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,870
developer so I took some workshops and a

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,079
part-time intro to web development

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,389
course and there was even like one point

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,100
where I was actually dropping between 8

00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:09,019
to 10 K for those you know six to

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,250
eight-week developer boot camps and like

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:13,819
okay I'm gonna do this I'm gonna be a

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,819
coder but then I decided that that

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:18,620
wasn't the path for me I still ended up

00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,149
going to startup at tech related

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,829
networking events just because I was

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,550
really fascinated by the culture and I

00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,230
just wanted to be a part of it but I

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,760
found it actually difficult to network

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,500
and maybe it was because I wasn't

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,970
portraying myself as someone you know

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,490
who had started a blog and had all these

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,170
skills but more so as someone who was a

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,470
government worker and telling everybody

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,329
I just want to get out of the government

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,829
so I used those skills that I had gained

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:46,639
from the blog and actually put them onto

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,250
my resume and then applied to startups

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,949
and not necessarily for coding jobs but

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,829
for things that were related to the

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:58,269
startup so such as community management

00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,269
product management and things like that

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:07,020
and then finally after applying for I

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,000
can't remember how many jobs I was

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,230
offered a job as a business analyst at a

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,550
start-up in Toronto and this was such a

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,290
turning point because I still remember

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,510
that specific moment when I called my

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,850
husband and I found out I told him I had

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,430
got the job because for the first time

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,910
in a very long time I was crying but it

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,649
was not out of frustration or depression

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,330
it was actually more tears out of

00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:35,279
happiness and of course I took it

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:40,770
because I was hungry for challenge I was

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,480
hungry for the change I was well aware

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,300
that I was leaving a steady job with

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,459
pension with benefits a lot of vacation

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,930
and of course I was met with a lot of

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,630
criticism from my colleagues

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,420
so people were saying like oh it was too

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,209
risky we were still in a recession but

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,649
again these were people who were risk

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,230
averse and they had been with the

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,810
government for 20-25 years so really for

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,130
them it was Easy Street so they only had

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,780
to work a few more years and then they

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,819
could collect their pension whereas me I

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,130
was in a different boat I still had

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,410
another 25 to 30 years and I couldn't

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,890
even imagine myself staying there for

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,890
another two years

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,089
so not only leaving that steady job I

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,589
took a huge pay cut but eventually I

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:29,100
made significantly more than my

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:30,840
government job so it's interesting to

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:36,330
note that at the government I was one of

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,860
the youngest employees but when I joined

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,640
the startup I was one of the oldest

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,800
employees so the CEO was 24 years old so

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,330
it's just kind of interesting to think

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,550
you know what was I doing with my life

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:53,250
when I was 24 years old definitely not

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:56,640
running a company so at my position I

00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,059
had to learn on the fly I was constantly

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,770
thrown into the fire every day it felt

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,309
like it was something new often a

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,410
challenge and it was insane learning

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,720
curve so this was a business analyst job

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,730
so being on the tech team but and then

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,159
also communicating

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,500
- - the business team as well so I had

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,950
multiple hats in addition to being that

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,720
liaison I was responsible for purchasing

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,639
purchasing servers setting up servers

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,919
maintaining the servers I'm trying to

00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:28,470
you know keep that uptime of a hundred

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,059
percent and it was just crazy to think

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,639
you know having a degree in biochemistry

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,490
and you know no formal tech experience

00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:39,240
no experience working at a start-up and

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,710
you know doing what I did there okay

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:46,679
so the blog actually ended up changing

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:48,269
my life a second time so unfortunately

00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,570
we got acquired by a larger company and

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:52,830
I was let go in the beginning of 2017 so

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,720
there was that brief period of time

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,059
where I looked at nine to five jobs and

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,190
then I saw it oh okay now I'm more

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,840
marketable I have a set of new skills

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,690
why don't I just look for another

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,850
nine-to-five job and you know the

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,230
thought was you know I'll have a steady

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,960
paycheck and I'll just continue to work

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,970
on my blog on the side so instead I

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,570
decided to dedicate the majority of my

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,580
time

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,950
to the blog and use it as an online

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,590
resource so based on the skills learned

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,360
from blogging I decided to create a

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,769
consulting business so while I was

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,179
working the startup I was kind of

00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,460
already in the process of trying to

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,340
figure out how I wanted to create a

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,500
business from it so it's funny because

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,000
instead of telling people that I took

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,070
the leap because you always hear people

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,929
saying you know I I took a leap I lost

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,250
my soul time job me I just like to say

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:44,130
you know I had a bit of a head start so

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:45,840
I was like pushed so as of right now I

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,669
teach and advise small business owners

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,179
on using blogging and social media for

00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,799
their business but of course again not

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,610
all sunshine and roses because we know

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,500
it never is so again I was met with a

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,690
lot of doubt and criticism especially

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,370
from my family because they weren't even

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,470
sure and there was this misconception

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,019
that you know blogging was still a hobby

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,580
it was only meant for Millennials you

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,639
just sit around your pajamas all day

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,679
blogging so all of these crazy ideas and

00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,899
like who uses the blog and I think

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,940
before I explained it to my parents they

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,870
were like what's a blog or what are you

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,279
doing and also for transparency sake you

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,430
know I was not one of those bloggers he

00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,320
was making

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,280
a full-time income or anywhere close to

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,620
that and another thing - not having a

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,660
business background I quickly learned

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,510
how different and how much more

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:44,230
difficult it is to run a business versus

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:46,480
using your skills and then even as I

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,100
started to network and tell people about

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,710
my consulting business there were a lot

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,480
of naysayers out there who didn't

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,800
believe that having an online presence

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,460
was necessary in this day and age that

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,290
you should only network in person and I

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,820
believe you know that doesn't make any

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,680
sense because the two can work together

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,810
because when you think about it the

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,400
people you meet say for instance here

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,880
you can stay connected with them on

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,530
Twitter or on LinkedIn or vice versa you

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,420
can ask on Twitter who's attending

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,490
WordCamp you know using that hashtag and

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,320
then if people answer you can start a

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,390
conversation with them prior and then

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,060
eventually you know meet up at the event

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,010
so a lot of people didn't believe you

00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,200
know again similar to what my parents

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,670
said Oh like you know social media it's

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,990
only for the Millennials it can't help

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,700
my business it doesn't work and then I

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,250
also noticed that many people were

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,370
charging significantly less to to write

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,190
posts hence devaluing the work and which

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:46,270
is why I decide to focus more on

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:47,950
teaching people how to blog instead and

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,280
then also with the growing popularity of

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,720
video people think that blogging is dead

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,100
which doesn't make sense because when

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,830
you think about it people consume

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,110
content in different ways they'll listen

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,000
to podcasts they'll watch videos and

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,280
then when people people as far as I know

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,260
people still read so they would look at

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
you know articles on the Internet

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,740
and I think it really depends on what

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,540
type of information you're portraying

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,400
because some things can be better

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,530
displayed as a video where some things

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,450
are probably better displayed as a blog

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:21,790
post okay so what happened after that as

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,330
mentioned in the brief introduction by

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,800
Kathy I am an instructor shared in

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,510
college for their blogging and social

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,040
media course and so I also teach

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,900
blogging workshops within the Greater

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,440
Toronto Area so I've taught them in

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,630
Oakville and

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,880
and in Burlington I've been a keynote

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:48,560
speaker workshop facilitator and panel

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,390
moderator at a conference I'm going to

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,340
be the co-author on two books that are

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:57,050
publishing in 2020 and then more

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,730
recently I signed on to be the lead

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:05,930
author on a book project that it would

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:08,150
be publishing around late 20 20 20 21 so

00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:13,370
I've talked about my story on a couple

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:15,320
of podcasts and I'll should be launching

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,670
a podcast too just to share with you

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,710
guys next month hopefully next month

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:22,670
it's called the bacon bits and bytes

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,610
podcast and of course now I am a speaker

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,320
at WordCamp Hamilton and where I

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,050
continue to share my story with all of

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,120
you so I had attended word camp Hamilton

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,860
about three years ago as an attendee and

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,100
I have never imagined I would be

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,840
speaking at one three years later and in

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,220
all honesty based on everything that

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,760
I've share with you guys I never

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,660
expected I'd be where I am today I

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,450
honestly thought when I was in the

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:52,540
government I'd be working there for

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:55,670
25-30 years and this is kind of based on

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,410
why I believe that you need to create

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:03,350
content or you should look into creating

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:05,180
content and sharing it so what are the

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,130
benefits of creating content and when

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,010
you think about it people are constantly

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,320
consuming content we crave content so

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm sure pretty much everyone here has a

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,420
smartphone and you know they're either

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,040
looking at it now or they they look at

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,480
it during their commute on your lunch

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,190
break you're just looking through your

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,440
social media feeds just scrolling

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:29,150
reading reading things while waiting at

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,460
the dentist at the airport and you never

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,540
know who is reading watching or

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,130
listening to your content and when you

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,510
think about it they may be waiting for

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:43,220
the right time to reach out to you it

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,950
can start a conversation and lead to

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,900
connections or opportunities so say if

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,490
you post something online it can catch

00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,360
the attention of someone they can start

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,010
following you

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,740
maybe it can lead to an online

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,350
connection maybe then even eventually a

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:03,409
video call a phone call a meeting in

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:05,330
person or maybe then a project so if you

00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:08,450
forget everything else that I mentioned

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:13,730
today I want you to think about starting

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:18,470
that passion project and find something

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,120
you're passionate about and I know maybe

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,559
some of you might be thinking like okay

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,330
well that's easier said than done how do

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:25,990
I find something like I don't know what

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,990
I'm passionate about

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,110
so here are some questions that I think

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:38,269
would be good to ask yourself what do

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,500
you enjoy doing in your spare time what

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:43,850
did you enjoy doing when you were

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,779
growing up and what have you always

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,779
wanted to try

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,450
why not learn a new skill so again

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,910
thanks to the internet we can also look

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,980
into taking courses webinars workshops

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:05,000
online if you can't make the commitment

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:11,000
to attend an in-person workshop take up

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,860
a hobby attend conferences meetups you

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,780
know don't be afraid to make new

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,820
connections and go for coffee dates so a

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,820
couple of apps that I use on my phone

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,040
for networking is the shaper app which I

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,780
consider it to be like tinder for for

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,630
business so you know you're basically

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,790
just swiping right the people who you'd

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,100
like to have a coffee with and then also

00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,020
there's another one called bumble biz so

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,760
I feel like made a few decent

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,040
connections through the shaper app but

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,300
I've yet to connect with somebody

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,300
through through bumble biz

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:46,540
so think about also tapping into your

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:54,410
network use your LinkedIn connections

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:57,880
and ask questions seek answers so how

00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:02,960
else can you discover your passion

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,730
reading books reading blogs what about

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,010
Bert bullet journaling you know writing

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,790
down ideas just jotting down things what

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:13,820
are your goals listening to podcasts

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:17,030
audiobooks or if you prefer to watch

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,450
things why not check out some TED talks

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:25,040
or YouTube videos so I'd like to share a

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:27,320
few of my recommendations so some books

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,290
I've enjoyed reading of the one thing by

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,690
Gary Keller and Jay papasan tools of

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,210
Titan's by Tim Ferriss there's a lot of

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,210
great interviews with famous people high

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:41,360
achievers blogs such as problogger

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,040
siegel work there those first two blogs

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,730
are mainly like blogs about blogging

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,670
digital marketing online online income

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,190
and the last one give me back my five

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,720
bucks was actually the first blog I came

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,740
across when I was searching how to make

00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,560
money online at the time so yeah she's a

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,990
blogger based in Vancouver where she

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,570
just blogs shares about like her income

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,310
and

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,310
besting advice and and things like that

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:16,590
the the personal finance one oh yeah

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,500
give me back my five bucks yeah it's one

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,960
of my favorites it's not too it's not

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,580
like um you know has a lot of heavy

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,270
jargon with investing it's just very you

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,950
know down-to-earth

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,380
easy stuff you know what you can do to

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,380
save money basic steps if you want to

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,720
start investing on your own so going

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,160
back to writing if you're interested in

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,500
bullet journaling and I just recently

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,410
started bullet journaling because I

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,110
found I had I had too many notebooks I

00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,060
had like an actual notebook for notes on

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,590
books so it was kind of like getting to

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,810
the point where I couldn't remember

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,630
which book I had that note but having it

00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,460
in one master book it definitely helps

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,060
so if you're interested in that trying

00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,460
the bullet journal by Rider Carroll

00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,950
productivity planner and then some

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,410
podcasts as well so the first one has to

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,480
do with more money mindset the second

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,900
one has to do with where the Reed

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,160
Hoffman the founder of LinkedIn he

00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,840
interviews people who have successfully

00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,600
scaled their business so the interview

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,720
with the founder of the Airbnb Marcus

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,520
Zuckerberg of Facebook and then if you

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,960
like TED talks to be honest I don't

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,180
really watch TED Talks this was the only

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,860
one but this was an interesting one why

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,760
some of us don't have one true calling

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,910
this is the speaker she talks about

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,440
multipotentialites

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,770
so it's basically how a lot of people

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,270
don't have just one thing they don't do

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,770
one thing for the rest of your lives but

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,470
how they combine several interests

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,660
together so want to talk about the

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,150
benefits of being creative it gives you

00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,470
time and space to think helps to

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:52,110
de-stress and reduce anxiety so a quote

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:55,020
I news creativity is not benign and

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,300
Metis Assizes it turns into grief rage

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,940
judgment sorrow and shame we are

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,840
creative beings we are by nature are

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,240
creative and so why creativity is

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,800
necessary and here are some facts that I

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,250
found I'll do some research it's the

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,810
single most important skill in the world

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,690
it's a it's a number one factor for

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:18,030
future success and it's related to nine

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:22,500
of the top 10 skills the global luck did

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,450
say is essential for 2020 and beyond so

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,630
create something and share it just write

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:29,310
something and share it online or if you

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,270
want to create something take a picture

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,560
of it and share it and of course thanks

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,440
to the Internet you can reach a wider

00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,180
amount of people online so don't be

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,250
afraid to share your creation with the

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,470
world so it's okay if it's not perfect

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,210
done is better than perfect so putting

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,550
out the first version it may not be the

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,770
best but you know if you keep on doing

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,940
it you will get better because also when

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,840
you think about it if you don't share

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,490
anything how will people know it exists

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,970
so where you can share obviously on

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,500
social media they Hance is an online

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:05,820
platform where you can showcase and

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:09,410
discover work so if you like to write

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,000
medium or a LinkedIn publishing platform

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,340
hit record so this platform was actually

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,630
founded by Joseph gordon-levitt if

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,750
anybody's familiar from third Rock from

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,040
the Sun I think it's also in Inception

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,040
it's so it's an online community where

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,110
basically you can post projects that you

00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,810
have and find people to collaborate on

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,160
arts and media projects together so the

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,540
focus isn't necessarily just like

00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,150
promote your own work but it's really

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,380
more to like find people to work with so

00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,130
say if you're looking for somebody I

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,980
need help publishing a book I need help

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:43,650
creating a film so we share thoughts and

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,630
ideas and we think about it we are a

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,810
sharing economy so people will share

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,370
things that they find to be useful and

00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:53,750
then they also share things that they

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,750
think will be useful to other people

00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,300
what's this one sorry okay so we're

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,300
sharing economy we've all known like

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:08,060
uber Airbnb and then crowdfunding

00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,060
co-working spaces TaskRabbit

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,630
only think about it that passion project

00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,980
could eventually be a source of income

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:20,910
and then it can lead to multiple sources

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,100
of income so ads on site isn't the only

00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,690
way connecting with other people through

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,780
your content and again as I mentioned

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,250
before it can lead to partnerships and

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,440
collaborations so think about your

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,100
online income stream is creating a store

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,570
Reese

00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,130
sources courses affiliate marketing or

00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,600
you have a skill you want to teach this

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,080
is what I'm what I've been doing is

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,250
consulting services creating workshops

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,390
pitching yourself to have paid speaking

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,770
opportunities

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,770
so the thought possibilities are endless

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,210
so it actually is possible to do

00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:02,610
something you love and get paid for it

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,620
so I'm not gonna sugarcoat it it does

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:08,370
take a significant amount of persistence

00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:11,220
time and effort but eventually it

00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,020
becomes worth it and of course don't

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,150
believe the overnight success hype you

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,400
see on social media so don't compare

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:24,059
your chapter one to somebody is chapter

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:27,750
21 so some key takeaways try and figure

00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:29,990
out what you're passionate about ask

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:38,900
questions stay curious

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:40,770
and start that passion project share it

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,480
because you never know what

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:55,490
opportunities are people it could lead

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:55,490
you to thank you are there any questions

00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:01,610
yes hi well thank you

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,020
valuator blogging

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,460
sure yeah so the question is if you know

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,600
what are some tips and tricks for

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,820
dressing like maintaining the workflow

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,830
and creating consistency so I can

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,030
totally understand because as I

00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,890
mentioned I was working for the

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,480
government and vlogging and then I was

00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,820
actually also teaching group fitness

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,560
classes while I was doing that so it

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,140
felt like I was having three jobs so

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,210
what I found is that actually physically

00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,990
scheduling it whether it was in my

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,940
Google Calendar or in my agenda just

00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,670
writing down what I wanted to do and I

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,260
think even breaking down because it can

00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,910
sound daunting like oh I have to write

00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,170
this blog post but I think even just

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,240
breaking it down into little steps

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,610
saying like oh I'm Monday I'm gonna

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,800
brainstorm ideas for the blog maybe

00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,410
later on in the week another step I'm

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,740
going to start a draft for the blog

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,140
another step could be okay the follow

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,390
week I'm gonna look for some images for

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,680
the blog so I feel again it's it's like

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,990
that's staying like how do you eat an

00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,570
elephant just taking it one bite at a

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,710
time and I think to also don't be so

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,780
hard on yourself because there actually

00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,490
is a thing called blogger burnout where

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,440
people they feel the need oh I have to

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,880
blog five times a week but when you

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,830
think about it you you're probably

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,720
overwhelming your reader too and said oh

00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:43,200
she's published five articles I'm so

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,520
behind so I think giving yourself some

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,040
time and space and just being realistic

00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,350
so if you can only get out one blog post

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,120
a week that's fine one every every two

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,800
weeks whatever works best for you so

00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,930
consistency can be really different for

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,430
everybody just don't be like me and you

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,310
know like wait three months and then

00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:02,090
start blogging again any other questions

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,090
yes

00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:17,330
in the financial world that's a good

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,770
question so the question was where are

00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,770
you seeing your income so when I first

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:23,630
started blogging in personal finance it

00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,490
was more so from the blog so I did a lot

00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,710
of sponsor posts and had brand

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,330
partnerships but then when I pivoted and

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,770
decided my niche was going to be more

00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:33,140
about blogging and social media I

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,030
decided that my blog would kind of be

00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,160
more of an educational platform so

00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,590
people would read and then eventually

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,690
decide you know if they wanted to work

00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,310
with me or if they wanted to do an audit

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,050
or if they wanted to do workshops so as

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,180
of right now I have kind of steered away

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,060
from doing sponsored posts and things

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,710
like that

00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,710
anybody else yes

00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,020
[Music]

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,920
I sort of feel like like it once I

00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,130
started I worried that I'll get two

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,130
wrong

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,050
okay so the question is I guess

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,840
maintaining blah blah glice balance

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:33,119
which is who's a good thing you know

00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,580
it's interesting this is just more so my

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,960
opinion I I don't think I can really you

00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,210
know give you as a black and white

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,830
answer because when I first started I

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,020
think because I was so obsessed with the

00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,990
concept in writing it became my life and

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,970
I really enjoyed it but at the same time

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,340
too I think it the moment you start to

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,770
feel burnout it's probably a sign where

00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,119
you need to take a step back because the

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,100
best way like when you think about it

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,990
you can't force creativity like if it's

00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,290
not coming out it's not coming out so

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,240
perhaps you need to like take some time

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,640
away from it and then you know you'll

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,100
come back feeling feeling refreshed so I

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,810
think you can balance the two but again

00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,280
it's just one of those things how much

00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,250
effort do you want to put into it

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,290
because unlike some of my colleagues

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,380
they have been blogging and also working

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,390
full time for like six years and now

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,470
they're making full time they really put

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,990
in the effort as if they were working

00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,880
two full-time jobs but I decided you

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,410
know I wanted to focus on my career and

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,840
just kind of leave it as a part-time job

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,190
so I don't think there's anything wrong

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,390
with you know staying if you just kind

00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,800
of want to dip your toe into the water

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,800
and start off slowly and go from there

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,800
yes

00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:48,999
yes

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,119
[Music]

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,460
yeah that's a really good point so the

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,360
question if I'm rewording and properly

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:16,070
is to look into it would it be better to

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,040
look into actually creating the quality

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,680
content first versus monetizing yes yes

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,260
and yes again cuz I think a lot of the

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,810
times now I'm sure if you look on

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,340
Pinterest you'll see a ton of blogs

00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,020
posting you know how to make money

00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,820
online how I made five thousand dollars

00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,260
and am I was like what I did this how I

00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,570
how to make money how to make money

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,340
which is great because I know for a lot

00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,990
of people eventually that's the goal but

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,230
when you think about it you need to

00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:44,540
focus on the quality first and building

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,060
the the community because there is a lot

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,800
of bad content out there but at the same

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,360
time there's also a lot of good and I

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,950
think you know as a blogger if you're

00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,740
starting a blog you owe it to yourself

00:39:51,950 --> 00:40:00,550
and the community to provide decent

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,550
content yes

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:16,750
so what I did mainly to be honest I

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,520
didn't know sorry the question was how

00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,490
businesses they end up using blogging

00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,370
now to drive traffic to their site and

00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:26,560
how I use SEO to help drive traffic so

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,840
for the most part to be honest when I

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,370
first started a few years ago I didn't

00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,510
really know anything about SEO I was

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,520
very scared I'm like what is this

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,890
acronym this sounds very scary I'm gonna

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,520
hold off on it for now so really how I

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:42,790
built my traffic was mainly through you

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,560
know building community social media and

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,870
then also doing a lot of guest posting

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,250
as well because then when you think

00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,110
about it if you're posting on somebody

00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,820
else's site you're creating a link and

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,380
then exposing yourself to new audience

00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,260
and hopefully in turn they will also

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,870
promote it to their website so I do a

00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,940
little bit of basic on page SEO nothing

00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,290
too crazy technical I don't know people

00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,030
stress the importance of keywords

00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:06,570
keywords but then when you also think

00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:10,060
about it too you have to look at writing

00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,470
quality content as well so really at the

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:17,070
end of the day I think it's the quality

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:17,070
content that's what gets shared yes

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:55,039
uh-huh

00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:55,039
[Music]

00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,760
yeah definitely so this is more of a

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,340
great comment by the way I'm just

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,350
talking about how the Google algorithm

00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:19,910
now focuses on providing readers with a

00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:19,910
better quality content yes

00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,580
oh okay so just going back into that so

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,110
the question is how you transition into

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,990
paid speaking I've only actually had one

00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:35,390
paid speaking opportunity but I think

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,280
doing things such as this you know

00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,290
applying to speak at conferences making

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,230
sure that you can get either photos or

00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,730
video and then post it on your website

00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:46,550
and another great way like I have it on

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:49,220
my site where I have a page so basically

00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,020
saying what I can speak about where I've

00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,450
spoken type thing and then inviting

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,070
people to schedule a call with me if

00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,930
they're interested in having me as their

00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,030
speaker so just putting it out there too

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,130
and I think showing some proof if you

00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,440
have it and it's not dead getting the

00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,120
proof so I think that's all we have for

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,160
now okay so thank you so much for your

00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,510
questions of course I'll I'll be around

00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,100
then during lunch time you have any

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,320
questions feel free to reach out thank

00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,689
you

00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,689
