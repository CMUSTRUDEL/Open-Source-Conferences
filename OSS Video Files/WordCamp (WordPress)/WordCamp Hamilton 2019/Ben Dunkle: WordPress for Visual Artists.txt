Title: Ben Dunkle: WordPress for Visual Artists
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	WordPress is a great place for visual artists to share their work, but getting things set up can be challenging. In this talk, I’ll cover everything from preparing imagery of artwork for the web, useful built-in WordPress functions, recommended plugins, and improving the user’s viewing experience. I will also demonstrate my free WordPress theme, optimized for artists.

all right so Mike talk is called

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,990
WordPress for artists and I have a link

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,710
to the slides here it should be at the

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,390
end of the podcast as well just a couple

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,300
notes about this presentation I have

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,130
given it before and I'm trying to make

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
it better every time I do it so if

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,060
you've seen it on work camp TV or you've

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,610
watched me do this before hopefully

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,870
there'll be some new content in here and

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,899
maybe since you've last seen it you have

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,579
questions also at any time during the

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,710
presentation if you have a question feel

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,020
free to raise your hand I don't need to

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,390
finish my presentation before questions

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,239
can be fielded so absolutely raise your

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,750
hand if you have any questions so a

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,020
little bit about myself these

00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:05,760
presentation mode gotcha okay I tried

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:08,570
that before a presenter view I tried it

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,570
this before

00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:15,850
just do that yeah okay and then I can't

00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,109
see my notes though oh well now I you

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,119
know I don't need my notes I don't need

00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,659
notes I can just make it up as I go yeah

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,240
that's right

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,189
all right I've done this many times okay

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,140
so about me yeah I do a lot with

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:30,310
WordPress I've been involved with

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,740
WordPress since the 2000s 2007 2008 I

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,569
started working on the core design of

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,079
WordPress essentially the iconography

00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:41,860
and still do that stuff I also use

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,610
WordPress for my own work for client

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,329
work

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:49,810
I teach wordpress classes and workshops

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,939
and I do other stuff too

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,420
I play chess if anybody likes chess I

00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:59,469
I'm a real chess freak I teach college

00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:02,289
and I make art on the side if I have

00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,899
time I paint draw I am my backgrounds in

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,289
printmaking but there's really no jobs

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,090
as print maker in the world I do make

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,040
fonts yeah I haven't fine if you go to

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,769
dafont.com you can see some of my fonts

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,500
they're like oh you know in the Wild

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:20,709
West out right out there but I just like

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,799
making stuff sort of I'm making I when I

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,450
like cars and I have a cool car and I

00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:30,370
have a little scooter and skateboard and

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,680
so forth so why should we as artists and

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,329
at essentially visual artists it's

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,919
another key component here there's lots

00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,750
of different kinds of artists but you

00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,609
want to put your imagery if you make

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,250
images as an artist if you make things

00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:44,470
that people look at why would WordPress

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,700
be a good choice you have a lot of

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,040
choices as an artist

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,160
there's Squarespace there is Wix there's

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Weebly you can also post your work on

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,510
social media Instagram Twitter and so on

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,590
so there's lots of ways to get your

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,230
images out into the world

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,250
and well what is it about WordPress that

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,720
as an artist you should be drawn to and

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,099
that's what this talk is going to be

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,650
about so I kind of narrow it down to

00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,319
three things that WordPress offers that

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,750
other spaces don't

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,120
the first being authenticity

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,250
the second is ubiquity and then the

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,950
third is aesthetics so let's talk about

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,500
authenticity we think authenticity we

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,780
think about things that feel like

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,970
they're real that they have an origin

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,280
somewhere that we can identify we know

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,590
where they came from we have a an image

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,390
in our heads of what that time period

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,940
was who were the people that used the

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,950
image or use the thing if we can say

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,910
something's authentic we have a sense

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,530
that it is real and original and for an

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,780
artist this is an important thing when

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,510
we make work we want to be identified

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,940
with that work as the contents owner or

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,010
creator and so there forth into these

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,390
the authenticity is very important for

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,890
artists this is a kind of a revision of

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,430
a previous slide that I have I think the

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:10,310
idea is the same when we make an image

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,110
so we own it oh when we first see an

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,970
image where does an image begin it

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,980
begins in our mind so if I'm in the

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,320
middle of a forest and I see a beautiful

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,669
new bird nobody's ever seen before

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,400
I own the image of that bird it's in

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,370
terms of ownership it's in my head so

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,370
it's mine image I could spell that one

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,010
but now what happens to that image well

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,169
okay so it goes and starts to become

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,780
everyone's image once it leaves my mind

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,690
let's say I take a picture of it with my

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,729
phone okay well now it's in my phone but

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,530
it's still mine but what if my phone is

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,120
uploading this to the cloud without my

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,740
knowing it well now it's in the cloud

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,540
somewhere so maybe there's somebody else

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,979
in the world that might see it too so

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,810
that other person might say you know I

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,910
saw this great new bird and it's you

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,970
know I'm gonna get all famous for

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,860
discovering the bird and then as we keep

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,800
going up this this pathway here of

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,290
sharing our image with the world slowly

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,440
your image changes from being yours to

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,570
being everybody's now somewhere at the

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,200
end of this path it's on social media

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,030
it's on Instagram Facebook Twitter

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,169
Pinterest wherever and at that point

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,300
it's very very much

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,630
everyone's image but somewhere in

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,780
between there's WordPress and that's why

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,669
WordPress is a great tool to retain as

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,039
much authenticity as you can over your

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:34,520
images another way to look at this chart

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,090
is to say about an image is the image

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,639
real what makes them

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:43,110
image real well the image is real when I

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,620
see it I know that it's a real thing but

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,850
as it slowly goes towards the public and

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,740
on social media

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,510
it starts to become a fake image people

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,030
can say all that image is fake that's

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,949
not that that's not a real bird there's

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,419
no such thing as a purple bird with

00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,740
green spots because somebody could just

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,600
Photoshop that so the the other side of

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,910
the thing with authenticity is that we

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,820
can say that an image is real the closer

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,080
it is to the first impression now if

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,340
you're an artist the first impression

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
might be a painting he just made nobody

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,340
else in the world has ever seen it

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,260
except for you but when the artist gets

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,479
to the when that painting gets on social

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,000
media it becomes a you know a

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,600
potentially a fake image but I didn't

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,050
really make it so we're gonna say talk

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,320
about why this with this wordpress on

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,080
your having WordPress enables you to

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,810
share your work with the world as well

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,669
as retain ownership of a domain so if

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,060
you have a domain where your images are

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,740
being hosted and being seen on there's a

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,930
very strong connection a very close

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,639
level of ownership between you and those

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,470
images you are that is your space if the

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,830
owner of the space that the image is

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,930
hosted on is facebook.com or Instagram

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,330
com if that's where the end result of

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,770
the image is that that should be obvious

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,320
that that's not your domain that's

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,270
somebody else's ownership so Mark

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,000
Zuckerberg might claim own for ownership

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,220
of the purple green spot at birth so

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
that's essentially what I'm saying here

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,900
about authenticity is that WordPress

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,700
gives you the ability to run and

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,500
distribute your web hit your imagery in

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,610
your own space and on your own terms

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,020
next reason why an artist should be

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:31,590
drawn to WordPress is ubiquity WordPress

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:35,639
is everywhere it runs over 30% of all of

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,770
our web sites and over 60% of content

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,530
management systems that are running our

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,020
running WordPress and this all comes

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,760
down to having the largest pool of

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,130
resources if your website is in

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,569
WordPress you have the most amount of

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,180
support that you're going to get you

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,410
lots and lots of plugins you have lots

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,020
and lots of themes that you can pick

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,729
from so by having a ubiquitous platform

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,039
that you're putting your work on and

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,470
distributing your work on you're taking

00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:07,479
advantage of this ubiquitous platform

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:09,819
with lots and lots of support the last

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,990
reason why I like I think WordPress is

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,110
important is because of the core

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,810
aesthetics of the software artists are

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,400
very in tune with the tools they use if

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,840
you're a painter you might be very

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,599
particular about a certain kind of brush

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,130
or you might be drawn to a kind of paint

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,690
that you want to use you might like

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,970
certain pencils over others you might

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,159
like pens and so on and if your

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,169
photographer you might like Canon or you

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,779
might like Nikon or you might like DSLRs

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,089
and who knows but you have a very strong

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,190
connection to the tools and I think that

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,839
the word press tools embody aesthetics

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,839
in a way that other tools that do the

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,830
same kind of thing do not WordPress is

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,870
designed from a standpoint of solid

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:53,529
typography and design graphic design

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,130
tenants it was made with the idea that

00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:00,790
the tools that you use should be as as

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:03,070
beautiful as the work that you're

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,220
displaying and I think this gets to the

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,760
point that WordPress has this idea that

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,130
and good software treats user interface

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,550
in the user experience as an artistic

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:19,320
medium in itself that the every aspect

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,970
of using a piece of tool should have a

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,899
maximum appeal in terms of its artistic

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,970
merit and if you just consider the words

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:31,060
in the name of the press off where word

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:35,709
press a word is something that's very

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:38,529
very real and and organic it's a it has

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,420
a tangible quality to it and a press is

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,130
something that we've throughout history

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,050
used to distribute and communicate ideas

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:51,010
so right from the beginning a press was

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:53,920
a way of communicating so just the idea

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,079
of connecting with that historical press

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,940
always appeal to me right from the start

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,279
when when I would start first getting

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,130
into trying to do dynamic websites and

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,380
not just coding flat pages for each

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,820
the different parts of the website I was

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,210
playing around with lots of the

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,620
different tools at the time there was a

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,910
Joomla and Ubuntu Drupal and there was

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,230
only one that was I was really curious

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,950
about which was called movable type

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,750
sounds very similar to for WordPress so

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,130
movable type kind of just faded out but

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,990
WordPress really really grew and

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,670
extended and I'm glad I right from the

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,560
beginning was drawn to it but maybe the

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,450
reason why was was because of this

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,300
aesthetic feel that had that none of the

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,770
other ones seemed to have as well my

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,770
background as I said is in printmaking

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,270
so I'm really you know and even the fact

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,770
that Gutenberg is just a great example

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:46,990
as well it's this recollection of of

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:52,390
historical communication methods and

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:55,920
people that were involved with that okay

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,450
so hold on one second

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,400
functionality so let's talk about about

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:05,860
the the kind of functionality that a an

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,440
artist website needs to have and I'm

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,020
just going to list a few things here

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,380
what primary functions are artists

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,970
looking for in their WordPress in their

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,280
websites essentially not necessarily

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,320
even WordPress well artists want to be

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,140
able to manage images and present images

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,960
and manage them artists often have

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,510
events and shows exhibitions and and and

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,070
this is an important part of their that

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,610
their website that they need to be able

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,350
to take care of their resume should be

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,120
on their website so an artist wants to

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,410
display a CV or a resume being able to

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
integrate their website with social

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,020
media artists are very active on social

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,030
media we post pictures and we don't

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,770
always do that on our website so we want

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,380
to integrate our social media with our

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,980
website artists are concerned with

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,470
copyright or how can I help or protect

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,420
my images from being either stolen or

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,890
taken credit for and so on often artists

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,280
want to sell work on their website so

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,170
there's an e-commerce function and then

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,570
finally a blog many artists want to as

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,819
well as post work also write blog posts

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,470
and this is a unique set of functions

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,739
you artists and I don't feel like is one

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,319
that is been fulfilled I think artists

00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:27,079
are space that there doesn't exist a

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:30,529
good solution for in WordPress or in the

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,869
web at all so what I'm trying to look

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:36,109
for here is how do we construct this how

00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:39,259
do we make the perfect theme with the

00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:43,429
perfect functionality that would be the

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,809
most appealing first artists well of

00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,369
course let's look at the problems and

00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,499
then talk about the solutions to those

00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:52,220
problems if there are any that are

00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:53,839
unique to artists one of the big

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,209
problems in our artists website has is

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,649
site speed there's lots and lots of

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,350
images on your website if you're an

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:03,829
artist and you want to keep your images

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,600
very low in size however when you take a

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,249
picture with your camera your image is

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,009
gonna be megabytes and megabytes rather

00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:11,899
than I would say 200k or less is what

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,419
you would probably want to optimally be

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:18,679
at so that's a big problem for artists

00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:21,549
and well what's the solution well here's

00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,139
some plugins that can help with that

00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:26,089
compressing images that you upload to

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,909
your website with a plug-in called

00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,169
smoosh it there's probably other plugins

00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,979
as well but this is one that I've used

00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:36,019
in the past lazy loading images

00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,699
especially for people that are on mobile

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,489
phones when somebody comes to your

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:42,409
website and you have a hundred images on

00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:45,529
it a phone is only going to be able to

00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:48,439
display one or two but with lazy loading

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,869
plugins you can have the only the

00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:54,169
pictures that are on display in the

00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:56,419
phone be loaded and then as soon as

00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:58,639
somebody starts to swipe down the other

00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:02,989
images get loaded so that will vastly

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,299
increase your site speed a third problem

00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:06,919
that you know with a artists website is

00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:09,199
that as we're uploading images we're

00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,249
adding images to our site it could take

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,609
a long time

00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:17,389
well software plug-in like insanity will

00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:20,089
block the original 20 megabyte image off

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:22,789
of your DSLR from having to be uploaded

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,319
and it will only upload a smaller

00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:28,489
version of whatever our version that you

00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:29,670
might need similarly to the problem of

00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:33,120
site speed

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,190
is site bloat this is actual screenshots

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,110
and there's probably 20 more that looked

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:41,640
just like this of an artist website that

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,800
I looked at recently well 2016 I guess

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,020
am and as you can see that there's just

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,870
dozens and dozens and dozens of files

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,760
that get created when artists and our

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,710
active artist web site where somebody's

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,500
constantly uploading images this is

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,630
because WordPress generates additional

00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,060
images from each one of the images that

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,710
gets uploaded so you have a thumbnail

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,730
size and you have a medium size and a

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,530
large size and you have the original

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,600
size and then maybe an even additional

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,840
sizes depending on some other plugins

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,760
that might be running so solutions to

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,320
this again insanity because we're

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,210
preventing the original image from

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,040
uploading that's going to save some of

00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:22,710
that bloat there's another plugin called

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,890
media cleaner which will look at your

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,320
website analyze where what images are

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,960
actually being displayed in your site

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,870
and then just removing all those other

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,560
images from your website from your

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,150
remote website which is great in terms

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,490
of being able to organize your images

00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,710
and not having a gigantic WordPress

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,510
folder living on a server somewhere not

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,070
necessarily I mean this isn't a problem

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,870
for you I wouldn't recommend it but if

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,540
it is a problem and you're moving sites

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:57,780
around me you know doing that might be

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:59,610
helpful did you have a question I do not

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,750
know that that's a good question I'm not

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,750
sure yes

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,380
mm-hm

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:52,140
okay yeah okay so the question is is

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,630
there a way for you to be able to see in

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,029
your media library if you have several

00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,560
images that are of the same image that

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,510
you may have uploaded at different times

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,940
which is the one that's actually being

00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:05,939
used on your website and being able to

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,949
then delete the other images and again

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm sorry but I don't know the answer to

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:22,490
that yeah yeah personally I think that

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,069
the media library should not be your

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,380
method for organizing your image your

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:31,140
image management should happen on your

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,580
own computer with your own backups your

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,990
website should really just be a delivery

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,620
mechanism for your images to the public

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,570
so but that just another point about I'm

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,630
gonna be saying mentioning plugins quite

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,059
a bit in this talk I am NOT vouching for

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,950
these plugins in any way I have used

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:53,220
them and they've been effective for me

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,290
however plugins can be problematic they

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,300
can conflict with each other and they

00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,610
can be a security issue I'm a big

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:03,210
proponent of not having plugins that you

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,679
don't need running on your website so if

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,740
you were to trick say use one of these

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,740
plugins and it blows your website up

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,750
don't call me no no you actually can't

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,940
call me and I'll try and help the other

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,340
thing is WordPress under settings has an

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,700
option for organizing your uploads into

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,670
month and year base folders most of the

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,710
time this is unnecessary I think for for

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,120
artists imagery it could be helpful I

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,610
mean it is a nice way to tag with an

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,920
original with the date information but

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,270
if it's becoming an issue where you're

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,090
trying to look through your folders and

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,450
see what your images are it can get very

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,669
very very very crowded in that WP

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,040
uploads folder which is where all of

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,870
your images go so that's just an option

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,779
you might want to take a look at

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,940
another option problem we have is artist

00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:54,549
is having these multiple platforms that

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,649
are all of our images are existing on

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,539
you know you're an artist or your

00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,799
photographer your images are everywhere

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,309
they're on Facebook they're on Instagram

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,600
they're on Twitter they're on Pinterest

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,010
they're on your WordPress website

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,250
they're all over the place

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:12,370
and it's a giant jumble a storm of all

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,860
kinds of images and where they are and a

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,440
solution would be to integrate those

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,450
better and take your WordPress and

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,090
consider your WordPress website as your

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,419
hub this is where your images either

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,520
originate or come in from so you can

00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,799
send you post an image on your WordPress

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,309
website you send it out to your social

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,559
media with a plug-in like jetpack or

00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:38,049
next script social networks Auto poster

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,000
when you post an image on your Instagram

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,880
you make it come to your website through

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,919
plugins like WP Instagram widget this

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,100
and same with Facebook and Twitter so I

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,159
just have a few links to plugins that

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,510
through I've either used or done a

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,659
little bit of research on to find which

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,340
ones are considered the best now there's

00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,710
lots and lots of plugins that do lots of

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,720
the same thing so I would recommend not

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,159
just going with my word here but doing

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,380
some research yourself just know that

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,590
using your WordPress website as your hub

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,929
is a good idea as an artist and that

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:13,840
that way you have further control and

00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:18,070
ownership of the images that appear on

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,039
the web in public ok another problem we

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:25,600
face as artists is with piracy and

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,820
content theft copyright issues there's a

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,010
saying that if you can see it I can copy

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,830
it if I can hear it I can copy it and

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:36,010
this is why nobody will ever be able to

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:39,490
stop people from stealing images movies

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:43,210
music it's just impossible our sense is

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:46,330
11 sensing something and copying it are

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:50,080
just so seamless we can instantly copy

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:52,659
anything we see or hear people talk

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,669
about watermarks as a way well watermark

00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,710
stink I don't want a watermark on my

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:58,960
image I want my image I don't want to

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,149
see some extra thing there that's

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,659
not really there and they can also be

00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:07,980
removed there's a link in here on how

00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:11,110
some scientists figured out a way to

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,570
strip out watermarks almost the point of

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,539
being indecipherable from the image and

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,460
I think even so that that that well you

00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,850
couldn't tell so they're not really even

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,309
effective so the solution for this is

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,520
you know do what you can and accept what

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,899
you can't do anything about you know

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,309
there's gonna be a point where if

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,049
somebody really really wants your image

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,570
they're going to get it and you can just

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,360
live with that but if you must watermark

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:40,929
your image here's a couple of links for

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,549
watermarking imagery there's also people

00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,500
talk about the disabling of the

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,779
right-click I don't know about you but

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,549
when I see I right-click on a website

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,500
and I nothing comes up and you know the

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,409
right-click is where you mouse click or

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,710
you control click with your keyboard and

00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:59,350
a little menu comes down save image copy

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,669
image or so on well if you ever gone to

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,159
a website and tried to do that and

00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,200
nothing comes on there's some disabling

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,330
of your light click functionality going

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,919
on and I know that that makes a lot of

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,260
people mad I don't want you to change

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,720
the way my computer works let me right

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,100
click so if you really must disable

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,659
right click and a lot of people do

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,080
because I think this plug-in has over a

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:23,860
hundred thousand installs you can use WP

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:27,250
content copy protector when I first gave

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,799
this talk I had someone mentioned a

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,230
technique called shrink wrapping images

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,029
and I thought it was really really cool

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,330
sort of an innovative way to trick

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:39,730
people who try to steal your images so I

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,919
always wanted to write a plug-in so I

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,470
did I took the idea and turned it into a

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,270
plug-in so you can check out shrink wrap

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,460
images and try that on your website and

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,610
see how it works it's a plug-in I wrote

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,380
and it has 50 installs right now so

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,320
we're getting bigger last time I'd even

00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:00,159
tuck it was 30 so it has three star five

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,960
star ratings though okay I'm sorry yeah

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
what it does is it takes that the

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,809
question is what does the shrink wrap

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:10,360
images do it puts up a one tiny pixel

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,150
image on top of all of your images so

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,030
that when somebody right clicks the

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:18,540
image they only get the invisible image

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:21,300
now I want them to I want to put like

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,860
images like stop stealing my artwork

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,870
when they download it they open it up

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,990
and they're like mm-hmm so I'm that's

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,300
like my next version 2.0 but for now it

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,270
just gives them invisible image so

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:38,490
that's uh I think it's kind of fun

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:40,680
invisible image yeah that's I can name

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,610
it that's an easy fix I'm gonna do that

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,710
yeah yeah hands off buddy yeah

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,710
[Music]

00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,760
that's a good question so like they

00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,830
would okay so the question is is there a

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,840
way to prevent somebody from copying

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,549
your text and putting it on our web

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:12,529
their own website or something

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:15,899
I don't know disabled right click cuz or

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:18,809
but you could control C or you can

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,130
choose the menu edit copy you know

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,990
you're all they need to do is highlight

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,870
your text it would have to be like

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,100
prevent highlighting yeah I bet you

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,600
could do that you know what I could do

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,090
is I could do my shrink guys image on

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,450
your entire website so that nothing can

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:40,830
be clicked that's actually a good idea

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:43,289
yeah that's the bottom line if you don't

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,970
want okay the question here is that if

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,500
you don't want anybody to take it you

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,330
don't want to even put it on the website

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,220
in the first place I mean it doesn't and

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,710
that's that that's just the nature of it

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,019
it's in the public and somebody anybody

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,299
who sees it or hears it or wants it they

00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,250
can get it and you have to like live

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,450
with that to some level you can fight it

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,929
but you have to live with it to some

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,929
level yes

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:31,429
true that's a good point that's it

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,429
exactly

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,650
yeah that's a great point yeah that

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,809
really you wouldn't want images on your

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,250
website that somebody could actually

00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:59,460
print because it would be website would

00:25:47,250 --> 00:26:00,840
go so slow that's right yeah that's

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,080
actually a good point yeah you can do

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,780
that another problem we face as artists

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,460
is our images when we when we look at

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,350
them on our computers or on our cameras

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,049
they look great by the time they end up

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,080
on our website they look like this or

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:18,000
this there's bars or this there's bars

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,490
on the side and that and that's a

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,610
problem it requires us to become a

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,100
little bit more savvy about the context

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,770
of the image that the images don't

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,230
always appear the way we see them once

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,090
they get into the context for example if

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,610
this image of the bird was going to be

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,289
used as my website's banner I would want

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,809
to make sure that the correct correct

00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:42,720
portion of the bird was going to show up

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:45,120
and what I can do in that is to use say

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,520
Photoshop if you have a lot of money and

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,900
you want to buy Photoshop or lots of

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,360
programs will allow you to crop your

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,610
image before hand so cropping your image

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,890
to the wage you know that it's going to

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,380
be output is the best way to deal with

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,720
this problem there are other ways you

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,220
can deal with it in terms of tweaking

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,960
some of your media settings for example

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,929
cropping your thumbnail to exact

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,919
dimensions will allow the entire image

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,470
to be retained in the thumbnail size

00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,179
however unchecking that button will crop

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,490
off parts of your image so if you could

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,470
imagine say one of your photographs has

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,159
a focal point maybe in the top left

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,310
corner and that cropped thumbnail crops

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,930
it out

00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,880
that might be an issue for you where you

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:34,650
would want to uncheck that button when

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,650
you're creating uploading your image

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,150
problem I slackers huh yeah this is a

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,000
sliders okay so sliders are a giant

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,960
giant issue and people say no you don't

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,210
use sliders

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,970
there's the bane of the Internet and I

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,070
would agree with them and most cases

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,810
because people don't care about your

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,370
slider when they're coming to find out

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,780
what your phone number is but when

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,820
you're coming which is what most people

00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,710
go to websites for when you go into an

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,890
artist website you're going there to see

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,510
images so why not use a slider it makes

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,910
perfect sense to give somebody a nice

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,800
large image for them to get a first

00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,240
impression of your work and then allow

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,430
them to navigate through it

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,890
it's a great I mean I think sliders are

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,720
great for this problem is that not only

00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,120
that there's not very good slider

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,720
options there's a lot of slider plugins

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,980
every one I've ever used jacks up my WP

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
admin to the point where I don't know

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,020
where my stuff went I always see as ads

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,000
for going pro or upselling me to a

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:35,560
premium so what do we do about that I

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,260
prefer to use custom post types for

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,360
slides and building it myself being able

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,880
to manage your custom post types with a

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,250
plugin like post types order so that I

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,080
can say this slide should be first this

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,200
should should be second and then build

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,650
it on a lightweight slider plug-in

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,780
JavaScript library like cycle two now if

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,000
you must use a plug-in I'm curious about

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,690
this simplest gallery I just did some

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,040
research on with a jQuery cycle add on

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,420
to it so it's a plug-in with an

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,080
additional plugin you'd have to install

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:10,480
both and then see if that works for you

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,130
because as far as I can tell this would

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
be the closest thing to building it

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,990
yourself without all that extra freemium

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,120
pro upselling that you'll get with likes

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,060
a revolution slider which is maybe the

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,190
most popular slider plug-in I am trying

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,660
to write a slider plug-in I'm actually

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,520
for all these problems I'm trying to

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,970
write plugins that will solve the

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,040
problems without any freemium add-ons

00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:38,010
and ensue per light weight with the

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,010
bare-bones minimal code base

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,140
okay

00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:07,840
flex slider from JavaScript okay okay

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,100
okay

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,369
looks good to know so this leads me to

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,139
where I want to be with the perfect

00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:19,809
theme what is the perfect theme for an

00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:21,309
artist how do we envision this and then

00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:23,830
I'm actually trying to write it I've

00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,429
written in most of it but give me a

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,279
little while

00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,679
I want simplicity in everything I built

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,419
so I want the theme to be bare-bones I

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,739
want the plugins to be bare-bones I want

00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:36,580
the fewest amount of plugins that I can

00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:37,899
possibly have well what I suggest for an

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,730
artist you know the perfect artist

00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,739
website would be a home page that would

00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,619
feature a full width slider built on

00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:48,159
whatever simple slide plug-in that you

00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:50,320
might use or handmade and a brief artist

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,929
statement now WordPress when you go to

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,330
your users settings there's a place to

00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,759
type in a bio that's a perfect place to

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,639
put your artist statement if you have

00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,559
you know 15 20 30 40 where it's kind of

00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:05,440
like an elevator pitch this is who I am

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,019
this is the kind of art I make and then

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,779
maybe two or three feet samples of

00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:13,029
recent or featured work a great theme

00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,789
would allow you to put a toe tag or a

00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,139
category on your featured posts on your

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:19,090
on your post that you want to feature on

00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:22,299
the homepage and have them automatically

00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,100
display right there the perfect theme

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,070
would have a portfolio that would be

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,889
very lightweight and easy to manage we

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,960
simply create a post we'd add an image

00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,840
or a gallery to that post

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,690
we'd make sure that the images link to

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,320
the media file in some cases it will

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,529
link to the posts page which we don't

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,590
want the images actual URL which is not

00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:49,539
what you want you want the media file we

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,570
would be able to assign a category of a

00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:55,929
portfolio to that post and then we would

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:58,929
add it to the primary menu of our theme

00:31:55,929 --> 00:32:00,519
so that's what how a portfolio could be

00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,669
constructed in my idea of the perfect

00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,730
theme a plug-in is very helpful in this

00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:08,740
in this instance being that being the

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,830
responsive lightbox plug-in when I use

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,840
quite a bit

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,029
when we have images that are being

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,429
displayed on phones computers laptops

00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:19,549
etc in different contexts having a

00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:22,730
responsive lightbox that will take into

00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:25,190
account the dimensions and also the

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:29,299
aspect ratio of the device is important

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,309
so responsive lightbox artists you know

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,889
we mentioned we want to have events so

00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:35,090
keeping this as simple as possible

00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:37,429
letting people know where your events

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,489
are when they're happening and what

00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:44,179
they're about a lot of people ask do I

00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:46,039
need a calendar I don't think people 99%

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,460
of the time need calendar is it a

00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,600
calendar is just another complicated

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,159
thing in the list of complicated

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,309
interfaces that people are looking at

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,659
just a simple list very simple events

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,369
list as a plugin I've used it in the

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:02,989
past for this and it works really really

00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:05,090
well having a CV on your website how do

00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:07,759
we treat this well and in the plugin

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,039
that I'm writing your CV will be broken

00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:13,159
up into sections each section being a

00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:19,249
post and then it within the section a

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:20,929
repeater of actual unique events I've

00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:23,919
built this in the past using advanced

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:26,539
custom fields with the repeater and

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,220
using custom post types but I want to

00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,299
make a plugin that makes this much

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,100
easier creating a page called blog as an

00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:35,869
artist if you have a blog it helps you

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,789
promote yourself it helps you to your

00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:39,409
horn it helps your SEO I think you

00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:42,169
should always blog as an artist

00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:43,549
so create a page called blog go to your

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:48,080
settings your reading settings and

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:50,929
change your Post's Page to blog and then

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,480
best by doing that you'll be able to

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:55,519
have a page that shows all of your blog

00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,489
posts and then add it to your primary

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:03,799
menu in your opinion your menu manager a

00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:05,840
simple contact form you don't need it

00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,730
most of the time just that an email

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,760
address or a phone number however if you

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,040
want to call it does set have a tendency

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,190
to encourage more connections also for a

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,609
mailing list and so on I've used contact

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:22,369
form 7 and contact form 7 honeypot as a

00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:22,879
way to do this in the most simple manner

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,950
as

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,329
ever the plugins I am putting up here I

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,339
know there are other plugins people use

00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:31,759
they mentioned gravity forms I'm trying

00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:34,730
to post plugins that our core level free

00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:37,399
simplest way to get in and maybe not the

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:41,359
easiest but it's going to not have that

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:44,720
upsell that freemium idea that you see a

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,599
lot I know we're running short on time

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,940
so I can get into the last part of this

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,950
presentation talks a little bit about

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,539
just some basics for getting better at

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,909
displaying your images right off the

00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:57,259
start so I'll do that and I just want to

00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,940
leave some time for some questions but

00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:01,430
some imaging workflows that we should

00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,460
all be comfortable with as artists well

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,990
if your 2d artists get a scanner you

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,049
shouldn't be taking photographs of your

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,670
work with your camera okay now at the

00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:12,200
very least get a decent camera and take

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,049
pictures but if you have a scanner

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,150
scanners are so good at picking up all

00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,910
the details in your imagery capturing

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,599
all the colors the level of sensitivity

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,880
in a scanner blows any camera away

00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,559
mainly because with a camera a you have

00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,309
the shakiness of your hands you could

00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:33,650
use a tripod however you also have a

00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,869
distance between the image and the

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,250
camera lens with a scanner it is exactly

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,069
right there so you get much better

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,349
quality even if you have a say a scanner

00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:46,849
that's like letter size and your

00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:49,849
paintings are mostly you know 22 by 18

00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:52,339
by 24 you can scan sections and then

00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,900
kind of stitch them together using just

00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:56,059
learning a little bit about Photoshop or

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,220
an image editing program even if you

00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,559
make jewelry jewelry scans great if it's

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,410
somewhat flat like let's say you are you

00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,940
make necklaces try laying your necklace

00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,829
down on the scanner putting a piece of

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,990
velvet on the other side of a black

00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:13,220
cloth or something and try scanning that

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:15,109
I have an Epson V 39 it's almost 60

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,940
bucks it plugs right into my computer I

00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:20,480
don't have to plug it in and it's

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,440
awesome it takes great scans if you do a

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,049
3d art get a a box like this a shadow

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,589
box to place your your designs in or

00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:33,730
your artwork in and get a mini tripod so

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:36,470
that you can take great shots of it

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:39,259
don't just post your images right off of

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,180
the kit off the bat open up the the

00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:44,359
image in an image editing program here

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,890
I'm using Photoshop now I know everybody

00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,380
doesn't have Photoshop it's expensive

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,700
but if you do most other image editing

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,339
programs allow you to do a very similar

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,109
thing the levels are really important

00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,630
when you open up an image often you have

00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:58,279
a gap on either the left side of the

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,519
levels or the right side of the levels

00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:04,309
or both if you come drag these little

00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,710
triangles in so that they are closing

00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:08,450
that gap off you're gonna get much

00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,000
better range of contrast you're gonna

00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,279
have dark darks and bright whites rather

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,029
than having kind of grays and pale

00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:20,210
White's curves work very similarly to

00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:23,839
levels I like this general subtle

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:26,329
s-curve it almost always works to make

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,329
an image look better and using an

00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:32,089
unsharp mask filter just a slight 50%

00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:35,960
one radius always makes images seem to

00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:38,000
punch more a quite a lot of artists need

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,410
to be familiar with file formats so

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,380
understanding the difference between a

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,289
JPEG and a PNG and an SVG what is the

00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,390
difference well a JPEG is a great image

00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,109
file format because it compresses really

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,549
really well

00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:50,960
we can take one of those 20 megabyte

00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:53,630
images that are off of our phone and

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,000
turned it into a 200 K image well maybe

00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,069
not that much but we can turn it into a

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,390
2 megabyte image pretty easily I would

00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:03,289
say about 10 percent is very achievable

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:05,660
with a JPEG a PNG is more of about 50 to

00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,809
60 percent reduction and PNG does not

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,430
compress in the same way as a JPEG

00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:14,180
however what a PNG does allow us to do

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:17,210
is hide backgrounds a PNG allows for an

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,150
extra level of transparency that we

00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,369
cannot achieve in a JPEG and finally an

00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,079
SVG is a great file format as long as

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,140
your images are very graphic in nature

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,140
and don't contain shadows and colors and

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,119
tones and and those kinds of things I

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,289
know this is going super quick because

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,730
there's tons and tons more to learn

00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,769
about these file formats but those are

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,390
the three you should be familiar with

00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:40,640
and then finally I put some of the links

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,680
that appear throughout the presentation

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,029
on the last slide but I do need to

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,070
update this slide with some new ones

00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:48,990
that I posted just today

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,660
okay so that's pretty much it for my

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,790
presentation and I'm open for some

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:59,000
questions if anyone has any we can do

00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:59,000
that for a bit yes

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,130
I was I would recommend okay so Mike

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:17,720
what the question as I understand it is

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:19,490
are we allowed to or image galleries how

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:33,920
do we create what can you repeat it cuz

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:36,890
I don't sort of fly I think okay so

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,130
should we should we create image

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,500
galleries as separate maybe separate

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:46,940
entities of themselves or should we have

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,190
all of them together in one gallery yeah

00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,170
well let me just maybe there's a general

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,000
answer my feeling about image galleries

00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,490
is that they are underused and a very

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,950
very good feature in the core WordPress

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,110
functionality where press Howard E has

00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,660
image galleries but we always tend to

00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,840
drift towards plugins that do image

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,780
galleries all over again so I recommend

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:12,230
using image galleries as a post so you

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:15,290
make a new post and you call it my work

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,640
the MoMA show and you post all the

00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:21,020
images that were in your mo Michelle as

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,230
a gallery in that post and that to me is

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,430
the best way to manage a group of images

00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:32,030
that relate to each other

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:36,380
I know I don't agree I don't believe so

00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:39,830
I actually sure let me just run back to

00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,510
the portfolio here in this example this

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,270
would be let's say I had a show called

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,930
city lights and I have a bunch of images

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:50,210
that appear in my city lights show this

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,030
would just be a new post called city

00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,710
lights in my WordPress admin and then I

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,060
would add a new gallery and add all the

00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,330
images that went into the city lights

00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:01,460
show then my portfolio and I would get a

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:05,150
category I would put a category of that

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,760
as portfolio then my portfolio page

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,100
would automatically show the city lights

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,240
post along with the images that appeared

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:16,010
in that post in that gallery I would

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,650
demonstrate this if I have more time but

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,970
I hope we can at least some

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,890
you can kind of picture that how that

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,960
process would work it would mean making

00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:28,160
a post putting a gallery of portfolio

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,080
and then having a page not a page having

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:48,250
a category of portfolio be part of your

00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:48,250
website's navigation bar yeah right

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,790
let me let me see if I can demonstrate

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,610
this I think we have a little bit of

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:58,700
time I have a look I have a program

00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:02,630
called local which allows me to run

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:08,510
WordPress on my local machine yes

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:14,030
oh they do okay so they've took well let

00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:16,060
me just um he showed local local right

00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:20,150
right okay

00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:23,210
so let me just open up my local work

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,580
press admin artist site and show you how

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,770
I I would imagine the optimal way to do

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,330
the portfolio would be as long as we

00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,580
have a little bit of time and there's no

00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,020
more questions in the meantime as you

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,670
saw a mix if you went to it's gonna take

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,670
a long time for local to start

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,640
that's right yeah that's a great

00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:54,609
question it's not a post-its it's a

00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,849
collection of posts so I think this will

00:42:54,609 --> 00:43:00,880
be really hopefully explain my Maya idea

00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:03,730
here once I get past that okay so this

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,670
is my wordpress admin and let's say I

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:09,190
just had a show at the MoMA or well it

00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,549
can be what's a local gallery around

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,920
here the gallery of Hamilton okay so I'm

00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:20,009
going to go to posts and I'm gonna

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:28,329
choose add new and I'm gonna call this

00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:30,069
show at H E H okay and now I'm gonna hit

00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:33,369
the plus or I can go right over to the

00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:34,960
gallery head gallery and I'll go to my

00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,329
media library and I've already got a

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,839
bunch of things and so I'll just pick a

00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:44,440
few images that were in my show I'll hit

00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:48,279
create new gallery I'll insert the

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,400
gallery now here's the key up in the

00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:52,630
document tab on the top right I want to

00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,789
have a category I've created this

00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,039
category already if I haven't created it

00:43:54,789 --> 00:44:01,150
I would add a new category and call it

00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:06,430
portfolio okay now I'm gonna publish the

00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:11,079
post now let's take a look at my menu

00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:12,970
over here in appearance and menus I have

00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,759
a link in my menu structure called

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,670
portfolio now this is a category it's

00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:21,670
not a page you can add categories under

00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:24,309
the category menu add menu items any

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,460
category you like you can have recipes

00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:30,489
design I chose portfolio and I added it

00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:33,579
to the menu and then it appears in my

00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:37,450
menu bar I changed the name to have a

00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:40,450
capital P instead of a lowercase P and I

00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:43,839
just saved the menu so now when I look

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,269
at the website and now there's two but

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,839
this is the link to my portfolio

00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:53,130
and here's my latest show show at H eh

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,720
along with the images from the show

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,460
don't judge this this is just a

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,850
playground site it looks like garbage

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,350
but the idea should be there

00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,850
and once a my once my team is really

00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:05,440
really done it's going to look a lot

00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:07,450
better but right now I'm just sort of

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,700
making all the functionality right so

00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,380
does that help clear that up okay I

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,510
think that that's a great way to manage

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,850
your portfolios this use treated as

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,170
posts and it doesn't even have to be a

00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,990
gallery you could just post a single

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,910
image it would just be listed out in

00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:28,480
your portfolio page and so it's not

00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:30,930
really a page it's a category no

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,930
question

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,900
so yeah so the question is is there any

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:48,660
good way to organize your images on your

00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:51,090
own computer and not use your website as

00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:54,630
your image management and cataloging

00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:57,570
tool and my answer is I haven't found

00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,910
the best one yet I think Adobe Lightroom

00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,500
is supposed to be pretty good does

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,630
anybody have any suggestions for photo

00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,630
management on your own computer yep

00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,170
that's right yeah

00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:37,940
and it stings something with it and then

00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,940
not knowing

00:46:44,920 --> 00:47:04,160
that's a good point

00:46:46,930 --> 00:47:06,670
yes directly called process and process

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,670
is where

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:15,880
or someone

00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:22,640
and didn't see the process directly

00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:24,290
and you may find my values sectarian

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,900
stuff like that

00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:31,280
pushed out by Photoshop but if you want

00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,280
to find your region it's back there

00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,360
that's good

00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,180
mmm-hmm make sense yes

00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:58,640
you have made them appropriately - lets

00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:02,290
see Puckett's inside Gordon you might

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,290
have trouble understanding which

00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:21,249
yeah how do you okay so the question is

00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:28,400
so that's a suggestion to be even before

00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:29,989
you upload your images you should name

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,269
them appropriately named them

00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:33,470
semantically with not when you come off

00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:35,930
the camera they have got a billion

00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:40,059
numbers and letters and you should

00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:49,160
always tag rename them appropriately

00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:51,470
yeah okay oh there are more questions if

00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,039
not then I think we can return thank you

00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,039
so much everybody

00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,519
