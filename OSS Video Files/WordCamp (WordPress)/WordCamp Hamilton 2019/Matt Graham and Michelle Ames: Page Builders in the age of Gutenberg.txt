Title: Matt Graham and Michelle Ames: Page Builders in the age of Gutenberg
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Hamilton 2019
Description: 
	From the brains of @themattyg comes a panel discussion on the use of page builders now that Gutenberg is in core. Joining us will be @MichelleAmes and guests yet to be announced!
Questions that could be touched on:
What does Gutenberg solve that Page Builders donâ€™t? Vice Versa?Should page builders continue to be their own interface or adapt and integrate into Gutenberg as a collection of blocks?Why would a user want to use both a page builder and Gutenberg on the same site? Would they want to?Should developers focus on developing for page builders, Gutenberg or neither?How are you using Gutenberg today? How are you using page builders today?How do we change our approach to building sites for clients, when they have this new level of control?When starting a new WordPress site, what considerations would you take when choosing between a page builder, Gutenberg or the classic editor? Which one would you choose?If you already use a page builder on your site, would you consider switching to Gutenberg?

welcome everybody

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:15,800
today we're gonna be talking about page

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:18,210
builders in the age of whose burg so

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,260
paid builders but I think would think oh

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,359
there's that talk about the stuff that

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:30,570
was around before Gutenberg like do you

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:33,300
builder Oh bridge mentor Debbie thank

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,500
you Origen said see there's a lot of

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:50,160
them so what we want to discuss is their

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:54,329
place so we're gonna talk about what

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,980
what the what the place of page builders

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:03,270
are and now that Gutenberg is

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:05,729
essentially a page Rover so I'll

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,890
introduce myself then I'll let the

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:24,509
panelists introduce themselves and we'll

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:26,299
go over a little bit of ground rules for

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,229
a little bit of background and to be use

00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,320
beaver bill there don't hold that

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:35,820
against me for a lot of my work although

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,810
I do do a lot of very heavy

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,990
customization even beyond what

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,930
so kind of just speeds along development

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,650
anyway I've been working with wordpress

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,990
for six years as a developer and I've

00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,200
been using it as a platform for Goten

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,930
alright

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm the capital time the CIO at WP pops

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,690
where WordPress maintenance and support

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:07,790
company and I've been using WordPress

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,880
since 2009 and yeah use page builders

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:14,660
starting with a visual composer and then

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:21,489
moved on to beaver builder and I've used

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:25,370
all the other ones including birth and I

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:27,920
wish I had a customer success for

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,069
impressed org which is you might know

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,019
give WP that's us so we deal with our

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,330
customer issues and one of those is how

00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,060
to implement our plug-in using

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,769
Guttenberg and other page builders my

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,510
background is and you can hold it

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,670
against me if you watch Kindle because I

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,290
know beautiful sites but I am my

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,930
background is in Timmy so I used to be

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,040
almost exclusively but I have these the

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,239
others - the other one I don't think

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
I've ever used his favorite builder

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:01,670
McDowell and the community evangelist

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,560
for Vulcan which we make much wordpress

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,920
plugins and we're probably most known

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,140
for our page builder and our WordPress

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,690
onboarding experience and I like

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,760
everyone that has to like you know is

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,980
adding classifications will I use page

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,000
builders but but i customized it so it's

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,459
okay it's not a you know it's just tools

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,350
are tools exactly that's right

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,950
all right so a little bit of ground

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:30,290
rules I have a bunch of questions that I

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,730
took that basically pulled some people

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,130
on the WordPress Canada slack so we

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,570
pulled a bunch of the questions together

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,829
I'm not sure how long those are going to

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,430
take I think there's seven or eight of

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,590
them but there is a link up there if you

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,730
go on there and you think of a question

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,980
it doesn't have to do with anything

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,709
we've talked about already it can it

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:57,519
doesn't have to put your questions I

00:03:51,709 --> 00:04:03,800
will oh okay I never seen it work before

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,180
right so yeah all right and so and if we

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,129
get to a point where there's no more

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,140
questions on the screen I will ask if

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:13,459
you want to talk and ask your question

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:16,970
mark cool good you good

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,130
all right let's start first question is

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,780
if you if you already use a page builder

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,380
on your site would you consider

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,780
switching to Gutenberg as of right now

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,380
that's mostly doesn't know and that's

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,349
only because of the ease of use right

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,680
now I think that who Burke has a ways to

00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:39,260
go with a user interface and so once

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,180
they get there I think it has definitely

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,330
some potential however for a site that

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,890
maybe doesn't need a full image builder

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:52,180
with you know multi columns and you know

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:55,930
drag and drop I think yeah I went for a

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,300
page that doesn't fit yeah I wouldn't

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,690
convert anything that's currently in a

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:06,390
page builder because that's just

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,390
everything from one kind of builder to I

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,649
[Music]

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
know

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,560
but hear me out because that's how I

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,300
look at Bluebird because they had a

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
plugin called the legacy plugin which

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,790
meant older plugins that were meant for

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,560
the Juba 1.5 series woodwork engine

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,450
which is 0.5 so all these bucket

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,920
developers we're like oh we worked with

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,030
the legacy clunky that stuff works with

00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,080
the late C Plunkett there was always

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,850
this big battle

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,730
I even converted to the new framework

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,290
for not and you know who used the legacy

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,270
plugin people that were in the Drupal

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,160
community at a time nobody never use the

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,870
legacy plugin newly users to the

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,180
community because if you're a new user

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,070
and you're looking at a theme and you're

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,960
looking at one that is compatible with

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,720
you stuff and not why would you pick the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,990
not stuff if you just come in and guess

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,490
the block editor is new but it's the

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,230
future we might not agree with the

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,450
future but it's what the product is said

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,160
we're going so I would always encourage

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,110
new people to learn to the universe

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,030
standard and what's nice is page

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:02,070
builders can work inside of those

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,070
editors in different ways depending on

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,350
but sorry newer Michelle you already

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,670
touched on this but over again when the

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,010
starting new WordPress site what

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,260
considerations would you take when

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,260
choosing between a page builder Newport

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,260
or the classic editor alone which one

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,940
would you choose

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,580
so really I looked at at that for my

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,210
content architecture standpoint if all

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,010
day are wanting is just like a page with

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,650
just basic basic parts on it that are

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,090
too complicated of a layout or they

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,920
don't want a whole lot of content in

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,990
general I would go right with Gutenberg

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,180
you know starting a new site that would

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,860
be an install of Age builder it's as

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,930
soon as they want something where they

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,900
can really customize it you know like

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,650
specific design situations that they

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,360
need to meet that's when I would install

00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:06,940
virtually beaver builder but the other

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:08,800
ones are all that it might answer two

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,550
things usually is it depends and it

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
depends on what the site needs

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,660
what the user needs are sometimes it

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,090
depends on the plugins and whether the

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,680
plugins are compatible with which

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,139
builder you're looking at whether

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,550
they're only compatible in classic which

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,110
Muslims shouldn't be that way because

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,259
we've moved so far forward with

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,639
WordPress but also how they interacted

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:40,909
publish things work so I guess it really

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:46,370
does have kind of basically it is

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:48,020
dependent on what the goal decided is I

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,700
mean I think the biggest issue with any

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,140
CMS whatever is that people are truly

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,829
lion apps

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,300
phones have ruined the website the CMS

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,700
experiences where's Polly installing

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,560
plugins for everything and people forget

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,899
what the core does the word Mouskouri

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,279
does a heck of a lot and I think you

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,230
don't know half the stuff it does

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,730
because they're always going to their

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,339
favorite plug-in and that is security

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,200
risk weight and overhead if you don't

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:20,959
need a plug-in and you know plug-in

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,320
don't use one now it gives you

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,210
efficiencies

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,280
taking less time well that's the reason

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,990
to use it but the court has a lot of

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,330
power and I think we forget what the

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,770
poor habits itself oh it's probable to

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,020
see what the purpose of the site is

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,120
amenity decisions from America's it's

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,460
never one-size-fits-all like when I hate

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,900
it one of those themes of you by

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,720
reinstalling what do you recommend it

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,520
plugins like I was reviewing for a

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,190
newspaper that's with regular write up

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,150
like this business consultant and akima

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,110
folk who Commerce and it had no theme

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,610
and didn't have any folks in the

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,950
Congress although it was just part of

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,320
the package and it was like why doesn't

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,320
mean either so be as lean as possible

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,650
right actually it's what there's one

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,040
question here that seems to kind of stem

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:23,630
a little bit so what would preamble and

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,210
in my experiences from my experience

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,010
it's a tough it's great bending over and

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,110
then reverting back to the Dibby editor

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:44,860
just spacing and overall user experience

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:47,600
issues I want to start using however

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,640
which took page builder would you

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,640
recommend using in conjunction with uber

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,640
service

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
that's our other ones out there here's

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,390
my Stanhope it is bull big head box

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,070
before they were cool no we have over a

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,220
half a million block designs we've had

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,640
them for two and a half years and with -

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,670
about us is you can easily flip between

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:24,220
the boots which that's the shorthand for

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:26,350
our babies boots the Volt bit which

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,330
ladies on top of that or the collapse

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:34,510
again there and you can make a default

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:45,670
for posts or pages or ad hoc so the page

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:47,560
builders also have but no no seriously

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,120
this is true for anything perilous with

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,100
what plugin you use but we've got on

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,410
with sweet demo servers that you can

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,940
install anything off and spin it up in

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,190
less than five seconds they may need to

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,840
make an account so if you want everyone

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,310
if they want to test a theme or plugin

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,750
on the ability to just literally click

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,670
the plug you know the theme and positive

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,990
songs so you want to just test all the

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,520
page builders and you don't wanna deal

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,200
with local environment so you don't want

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,900
to spin up state dudes I'm your host

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,680
just don't throw away accounts that that

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,680
you don't care about

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:46,350
I think most of the ones like to be how

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:48,060
they interact so it depends what you

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,620
need to do and what that particular page

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,330
needs to do because there really isn't

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,520
any reason that you can't use both of

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,520
them on the same site depending on

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,170
so like this Gutenberg solve that page

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:18,360
builders and don'ts or vice versa let's

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:24,600
start later but I would say if you don't

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:26,100
have to if you don't need to use a page

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,740
builder then you have less boat so

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,829
there's less to worry about working in

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,449
less that can misfire and one less

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,480
plugin has to be updated that can break

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:38,009
your site etc etc so it kind of solves

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,129
that problem without having to without

00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,980
needing to do that I haven't played with

00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,839
it enough to know if after comparison

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,449
tip if I can get the exact same layout

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,970
to the food then I could with the Divi

00:13:48,449 --> 00:14:06,600
so I really connect in here that way but

00:13:50,970 --> 00:14:09,139
I would say so I will say that the one

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,360
thing it does solve is it brings

00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:15,170
hardcore JavaScript developers into the

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,990
WordPress space in a more familiar way

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,559
whereas a lot of page builders were very

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:26,730
dependent on HP still and they

00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:30,839
definitely integrate JavaScript but but

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:34,680
Gutenberg was built on you know I'm the

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,250
kind of cutting-edge JavaScript library

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,839
so that like you're really there and

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,759
there's something to offer her for her

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,529
JavaScript developers who may not have

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,519
known WordPress but as I was continuing

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,410
to take over the web

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,790
they said this

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:52,250
my chance to get into it this is my

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:53,029
chance to start over to me it is the end

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,069
of shortcodes

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,829
and that's the vision right and that's

00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:01,190
as a plugin developer that's that's

00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:04,939
that's my clean because short coats are

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,620
evil nobody really think about it like

00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:09,290
how many times will be headed in a

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,959
client site and you have 40 work hoes

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,160
and like three paragraphs of content and

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,899
then if you're trying to might get away

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,189
to something else it's a lot of work to

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,540
get away for that short but it's also a

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,220
short code would slow down the sights

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,250
and they have two parts of information

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,899
every single time and it was the short

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,870
codes were a hacky way around the tiny

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,939
MCE limitation to get information inside

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,420
tiny MCE but a florida page load and

00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:34,250
what's nice about the new editor is in

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,660
addition to all the JavaScript that's a

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,300
lot of technical improvements that we

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,189
can just hook into this data through the

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,389
converter box system but you can use it

00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,459
in other ways you don't have to use

00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,399
include a provocative plug-in developer

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,899
and your people you know your clients

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,300
and the users can see visually what

00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:52,880
might mean that spot because short codes

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,769
are confusing for a lot of users it's

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,880
just like yeah don't touch that text

00:15:54,769 --> 00:16:01,339
just trust me and on that and I've seen

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,889
pages with 64 code on it and that's just

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,610
they have a place for certain situations

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,610
but there being a

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,140
because

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:59,950
okay all right so watch the show posted

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,690
once that's what you said what does

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,510
having more JavaScript developers mean

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,809
for the average user hopefully it means

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,350
more options they have better options

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,329
not that

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,660
Noctowl script developers aren't great

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:16,179
but it is I will go on the record to say

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,919
that javascript is the future of where

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,620
crescents the future of the web

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,610
PHP had its time it's still going to be

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,220
used but PHP heavy code is kind of a the

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:30,070
older way and now that we've got things

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,530
like JSON and reacted all this beautiful

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,410
stuff that we can do with JavaScript

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:39,790
we're going to start seeing faster more

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:42,010
cross across device options out there

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,220
and really what it means for everyone is

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,080
that if we have you know people who

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,660
otherwise would have been off doing

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,280
something on Django or something like

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,490
that or saying like oh you know what

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,440
like I want to get into this you know

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,860
they're gonna start creating a really

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,130
awesome blocks and and the code

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,900
standards out there are sometimes better

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,150
not always better than the WordPress

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,610
base but we've also seen the spaghetti

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,220
code of WordPress worth we're seeing

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,929
people with really like strong like

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,820
coming from rigid rigid programs

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,730
software things out there really

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,590
understand software modern software

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,080
architecture

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,080
who are bringing great new things in -

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:55,529
sorry no one got that joke that's

00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:04,409
already been said and that Gordon is

00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:06,539
like the one of the big guys in yeah

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,519
I've always said the word was learn

00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,340
JavaScript easily that was that was the

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,600
big saying not here and that Gordon's

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,950
kind of in yeah I think I've been

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,659
training yeah you're blowing only said

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,029
that like once and that will someone

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,350
just tweeted me when I got viral tell

00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,389
people what because he said like if

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,369
there's one thing to do it's learned how

00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:30,259
deeply yeah and thankfully people caught

00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,259
on to that yes it's true

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,230
you can add more to it as opposed to

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,760
take or our way as far as people and

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,960
creativity you know you can have

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,520
talkative cookies you can have chocolate

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:56,950
chip cookies with nuts with butterscotch

00:19:40,520 --> 00:20:02,710
and everything okay anonymous posted

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,710
since you touched on to touch on devices

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:13,220
but what is I'm going to expand on the

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:18,200
question a little bit I'm not sure but

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:21,260
what what importance does and do page

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,100
builders or even Gutenberg have in terms

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,900
of mole because I'll give you a little

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,760
bit of background myself I do a lot of

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,240
the right designs that are very

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,180
intricate and they always designed for

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,210
desktop and it gets shrunk down to

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,460
mobile looks like that doesn't look good

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:46,630
you've got to tell me what you want with

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,630
it so I have my opinion

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,410
yeah I don't let the Canadian talk for

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,560
so as I said to get a loan in science

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,630
that are very interested and they just

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,180
don't think about what that looks like

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,190
and I mean nine times out of ten no

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,270
matter whether you use the page builder

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:18,530
or any kind of display framework like

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:21,910
bootstrap or what's the other big one

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:25,460
that accreditation foundation thank you

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:28,490
they all work on a grid that when you go

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,690
to Google by default just it's steady

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,940
and that may be fine if it's just text

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,650
content no problem but when you're

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,990
talking about images that are supposed

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:45,200
to you know meld together in some way

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:48,410
and you put them like that so when it

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,880
comes to page builders because it's

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,310
builders are supposed to be in a nice

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,330
easy way of doing multiple columns and

00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:00,650
you know intricate layouts that don't

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,360
work on mobile we're good bird I think

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:08,450
really shines of the fact that it's just

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:10,160
you try it it's it's it it's not quite a

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,050
fault it's not like a layer thing it's

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,630
more of a different piece of content

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,630
thing and stacking it makes sense

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,900
so he wants to start

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:31,520
yeah sure first off some of these

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,170
builders do have mobile responsive views

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,840
like an our original number the editor

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,220
which is cisco EMC you can choose tablet

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,070
desktop and mobile and see that a

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,440
creditor but I think it goes back to a

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,760
different point is that you know a lot

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,490
of people are stuck with like that

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,740
bootstrapping mentality with little

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,360
column where you know if you're

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,590
designing you need to think about the

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,380
user experience and how they're

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:59,130
interacting with your content and who

00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,620
the user is I was talking to someone who

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,200
is designing for you know a third world

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,730
mobile devices like screen they're not

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,150
even smart phone just like old phones

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:13,170
and the page was 50 Meg's and that way

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,940
lower than 2g connection period so you

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,590
need to think about not just visually

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,510
but kind of what the user experience is

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,130
and like we've all done things like

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,390
where we're trying to check the size

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,820
they're gonna grab the corner the

00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,200
browser we tried and it breaks at a

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,290
certain point and then the developer is

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,200
like well that's not a real display size

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:33,750
yes it is look it's here on my screen

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,200
yeah but no device has that size yes it

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,790
does right here at my screen so you have

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,350
to just think about the user experiences

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,350
at the beginning and not for the

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,630
shoehorn in mobile and again when we're

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,640
doing agency work we were focused on

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,070
variance and we did that by writing

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,470
story points on what is the goal of this

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,120
project and try to fill that goal and

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,890
there's ways you can kind of cheat it

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,860
like you can hide and display certain

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:02,980
blocks and certain display sizes to make

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,360
the content not completely big but I

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,430
have read that question to something

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,020
different how does it change in my mind

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,520
it was how does it a negative experience

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:14,080
is what I heard when that question was

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,910
read and I don't think page builders or

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,910
Gutenberg are great for mobile and even

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,580
period I think the word press honestly

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,830
the WordPress app that automatically

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:28,420
puts out for mobile publishing is the

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:30,700
best because we're trying to add a blog

00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,280
post on WordPress on your phone Neely

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,120
was just pretty annoying so we try to

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,150
add content

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,260
but for display you just kind of I gotta

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,910
think about it because I don't be a mad

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,790
as what school you use I think we just

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,900
kind of have to have it before profit

00:24:43,790 --> 00:25:04,950
service to the purpose of the site II

00:24:45,900 --> 00:25:07,140
did not try to I'll say at this point

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:11,100
the data and has grew to the

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:14,220
overwhelmingly Mobile is the future of

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,650
the Internet by ninety six year old

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,900
grandmother does not have a computer but

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,450
her experience of websites is entirely

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,840
mobile so it's not a generational thing

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,760
anymore we're talking like my my

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,400
grandmother grandmother everything for

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,380
hers on on the right back she goes

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,130
websites all the time never on computer

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,980
and so at this point if you're not

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,200
starting if you're not mobile first in

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,820
your design I would recommend that you

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,500
check that out you start considering

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:50,030
that look at mobile because I would

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:53,190
guess that probably in five to ten years

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,410
most if not all of your traffic is

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:58,130
probably going to come from somebody on

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,130
an iPad or a tablet

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:05,910
and you'll still get the occasional

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:08,010
desktop user but that's just kind of

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,420
where things are headed especially as

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,060
other parts of the world they're

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:17,910
developing nations that were previously

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,430
developing are now developed and so what

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,680
they've skipped the whole laptop or a

00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,120
desktop link entirely in everybody's

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,550
just getting a tablet everybody's

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,920
getting a cell phone so that's the way

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:32,220
it goes it's really build things for the

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,350
bulb in then you know figure out what

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,620
your experience is going to be after

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,620
that

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,990
a laptop a little bit smaller than yours

00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,730
then your navigation wraps and it's not

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,860
breaking like it's supposed to and I'm

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:29,110
seeing more and more sites that are

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:31,540
using our website and you know maybe and

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,470
it still kinda has a hamburger as a side

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,880
menu on this side as well so it is just

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,460
something you got to think about and

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,690
it's all user experience happens a lot

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,490
because you know like my biggest pet

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,610
peeve with WordCamp websites but I go to

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,740
work camps as I click the website unlock

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,830
and they will turn up at the venue and

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,240
the dates and half the time this is nice

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,920
as the base of the top you know how they

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,650
work camps don't have the date on the

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,180
property and you know how and the

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,220
majority of camps don't list the enjoy

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,590
don't list the address of where the camp

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,030
is like and that is what about the user

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,560
experience how people going to be

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,090
interacting with this content and

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,560
they're interacting different is on the

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,150
mobile phone the public even on the

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,460
session information the location of the

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,990
time and that's what they need now which

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,000
might be different the desktop which may

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,290
be a spunky hell they want to be about

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,500
the sponsor

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:23,870
site and then we're gonna release a

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,300
perfect order like a restaurant or sperm

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:31,310
but having phone numbers and hours of

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:33,680
operation on the occasion super okay

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:38,300
next question why would a you want to

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,450
use both the page builder and a little

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,450
bit

00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:08,390
no I mean I'll step below that to know

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:16,670
when it comes to a blog post you don't

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:19,970
want to have really yeah the paid pages

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,530
it's more static can have lots of

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,670
different information on it usually a

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:30,610
post is it's kind of focused on one

00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,610
subject and it's focused on

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:38,180
you're not trying to wow people with

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,180
with the design you try a lot of people

00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,230
I actually even though we kind of

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,799
already answered this the one thing I

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,110
will say is I think it all depends on

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,720
the individual the content of the

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,490
individual page or post that I have seen

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,650
great things where people have blog

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,170
posts including like New York Times has

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:08,230
done an amazing job with their long-form

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:12,340
blog posts that just have fantastic web

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:16,210
css3 transitions and all sorts of stuff

00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,520
that really just kind of gets you drawn

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,490
into the content and it almost get like

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,500
a motional response to but they're

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,919
building to get excited as think it's

00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,650
kind of like he's in and so really just

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,370
look at what your goal is I always

00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:37,030
recommend planning things out Shanta

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:39,490
will tell you post-it note as you as you

00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,260
build you know it's all about the

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,020
planning and so look at it and say

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,809
what's the right option because it's

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,630
never gonna be a one-size-fits-all for

00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:52,780
anybody so look at look at your content

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:55,330
and say you know just this need a page

00:30:52,780 --> 00:31:00,040
builder or does this mean the blog

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:02,740
editor and maybe the answer is it could

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,530
use either one maybe the answer is this

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,090
one just needs some subtext or maybe

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,250
there's even a feature that's in a block

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,220
with things like atomic clocks and code

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:15,280
blocks we're now seeing unique features

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,310
in the WordPress block editor that maybe

00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,930
you've got something

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,940
that's not available in page builder

00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,080
just you know look at where your knees

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,140
are looking with the needs of the

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,520
content I choose that way and I would

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,430
add that just because you had this

00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,980
opinion have to so just because you have

00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,780
the ability teeth to be or do builder or

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,200
whatever doesn't mean that you need to

00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,730
I've seen so much over design over the

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,590
years just because people want to play

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,360
and what to use the features that are

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,160
offered to them that's great for fun

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,060
just play to play with you know on the

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,040
background though because all the

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,210
sandbox have at it but you're building a

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,740
customer client Schneider you're

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,440
building a site for your own business

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,450
make sure you're designing for the end

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,360
user insight not just because you want

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,670
to play with sliders and different

00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,990
blocks and over designing it you want to

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,130
keep it simple you want to keep it so

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,530
that people are finding the information

00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:07,580
that they need and finding the content

00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:09,110
that's relevant to other searches yeah

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:16,940
well it goes on topic of the question

00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:21,310
like you guys said you building a site

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,310
for their users and I guarantee it

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,179
if they do and I guarantee you don't

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,220
really users as well as they think they

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,710
do and go back to the purpose of a site

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,270
have been writing with the purpose of

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,340
the site if I had someone who said have

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,700
this client they want to reduce the

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,200
bounce rate and sorry they want to they

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,419
want to change balance rate and

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,830
outsiders would you give guys so I

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,779
thought oh you want to reduce the

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,039
balance rate and increase the time on

00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,419
site they were like no we want to

00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,159
increase the balance rate and reduce the

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:52,669
time on site because they were

00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,590
government utility that value if we were

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:57,890
designed well people can find a question

00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,929
than a first Google in Italy and so

00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,549
don't assume you think you know what the

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,039
purpose of the site is just because

00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:07,010
their store asked the question the way

00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,809
outward it is is what will define

00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,490
success of the project

00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,500
in a binary fashion that we can look in

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,260
a year from now I have everything you

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,240
focus on that goal and it doesn't it's

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,750
just before it's just to make it look

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,399
nice

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,490
and you're from now that clients are

00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:23,590
going to care how many times

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,049
the client loves the site Six's goes by

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,740
and it's not doing enough because he

00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,740
didn't have those conversations

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,420
okay so I'm going to rephrase this

00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:45,110
question slightly but should paid

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:48,500
builders continue to be a separate

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:53,180
entity or should they start integrating

00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:57,320
within the wordpress page builder lock

00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:02,870
editor and add the functionality to to

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:05,660
block them absolutely they should be

00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:09,890
separate right now once once the block

00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:12,440
editor has a better UI I will 100% agree

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:15,470
that it's time to move everyone into a

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,020
single space or right now when I add

00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:22,190
somebody to brand new site who is not

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:25,010
familiar with like WordPress or anything

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,580
like that and I give them good work or I

00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,050
give them beaver builder they can figure

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,650
out beaver builder and about five

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:36,680
minutes it will take them an hour before

00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,390
they say forget this unfortunately it's

00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,990
just because it's not an intuitive

00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:44,570
interface right now but so right now

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:47,360
it's just easier to say okay just go

00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,480
right right into beaver builder build

00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,470
this thing

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,359
can figure it out because it's

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:57,540
drag-and-drop the setting of columns is

00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,060
option bar columns so really it's a

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,890
matter of interface right now for me

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,640
where I just find beaver builder it's

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,640
just so easy for no technical experience

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,359
and hopefully it will continue to

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:15,840
improve on the UI and be more intuitive

00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,310
and then the local see more that moving

00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,810
to you know

00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:24,610
walk-in said yeah hey I ain't groove

00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,670
that I think right now they do need to

00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:31,990
be separately people so to speak car at

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:33,400
least solo ballast but mini think is

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,620
something that I forgot I disagree that

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,780
I think that it's important to remember

00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,540
you know like added back to what design

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,800
would put its for and so you have to use

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,370
the tools that you need to get the job

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,770
done so right now the other thing I'm

00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,410
gonna say so I was on reddit in the

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,850
WordPress subreddit and I saw somebody

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,740
ask a question about what were your

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,810
thoughts on Gutenberg and I said I don't

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,600
have a problem with her I just wished

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,550
that there were lines around the block

00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,110
so that you can visually see them better

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,240
without hovering over them so you had a

00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,980
better visual outlay what you're doing

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,270
and somebody's response was oh there's a

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:12,160
plug-in for that my god there should be

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,620
that you can use your editor letter and

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,570
so and totally or you know make it more

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,190
intuitive I make it easier used that way

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,340
and I'm going to be adding plugins so

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:43,369
that people can use the editor so so

00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:45,859
yeah there was no you can't force

00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,359
even if it was like there was a hard

00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:49,280
stamps rule like you know when the

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,080
customizer first came out that he needs

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,790
to customize your a lot don't have you

00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,050
own Adam there are still things in the

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,760
people that don't use the customizer

00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,750
today and even if they take them out of

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,240
the week though these products that

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,790
exist because it's WordPress is an open

00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,950
ecosystem and the market is going to

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,599
dictate where the directions should go

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:09,560
and this vault hands really come

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,300
physical and I think intuition and good

00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,630
design and good user experience is going

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,250
to win out if that ends up in that block

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,380
editor great that ends up in something

00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,690
else great then I will say though is

00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,270
that third-party plugins can always move

00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,300
faster on the user experience than the

00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:28,400
core WordPress I mean we both good three

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,349
years ago I had features that WordPress

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,849
introduced to you know I'll be gear and

00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,070
a half ago that we had in our core

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,660
duplic all these joy features like know

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,220
that ideas are good here so they were

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,320
just there was simple generalized user

00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,770
experience things like the customizer

00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,390
things like that so like for example one

00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,280
of the things over it does is we renamed

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,470
post the blog post when you install our

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,940
plugin and it drives a lot of classic

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,619
WordPress people creatively coming off

00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,089
of the check box it's not worried but

00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,650
here's the thing is what's the most

00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:56,450
common question we asked how good

00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,130
suppose what's the most common question

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,630
you get in supports it what is the

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,460
difference because the pages play so

00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,900
a difference that's our statement we

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,640
think eventually that's movement that's

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,170
going to went out so I don't think it

00:38:05,640 --> 00:39:07,140
needs to be one or the other just let

00:38:07,170 --> 00:39:11,220
people innovate in the market so thank

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,920
you very much is before we I can take

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,310
one short question if anyone has

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,310
anything

00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,670
style

00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:38,440
unless there is that's where blocks are

00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,560
block starting to be played out so like

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,220
right now birth blocks are very singular

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,619
like a single thing but they can be full

00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,050
designs and they are in some cases and

00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:52,810
you can get rid of blocks that have like

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,060
full with testimonials so I ain't know

00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:57,880
people that use like our block libraries

00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,950
and table and they can drag a forward

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,480
testimonial if we call and they built

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,579
the whole site with our teammate layouts

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,369
Grayson wanted to be and then they do

00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:08,109
exist for whoever Cory's have a comment

00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,670
in the hunt around for them I think the

00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:12,190
biggest thing that that we can do is

00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,480
have a block we vote whether you search

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,160
for blocks inside of the head very

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,500
instead of having to because now you

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,390
have all these plugins that are five by

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,339
plug you know we made by our blog so by

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,869
Michael you three thousand blocks and

00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:24,819
that's adding more weight for something

00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:27,190
that should be native so you can do it

00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:29,790
but you have to like search for all of

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,790
