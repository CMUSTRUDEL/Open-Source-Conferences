[Music]

00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:00,990
[Applause]

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,650
[Music]

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,180
[Applause]

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,309
it's the last presentation of the day

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,290
and I like you just want it to be over

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,990
so we can all go and have drinks so I

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,519
will get on with it now I'm not the best

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,460
speaker in the world but I do have

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,420
bribes so if you take a photo and share

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,960
on social media today using hashtag WCB

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,510
NE and hashtag cake tune you can win a

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,820
copy of my book or add a curl or a pen

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,040
I've got breaks basically so share my

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,210
stuff and there's stuff in for it and

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,590
then everyone will think I'm a really

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,870
good speaker and book me for other

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,300
events it's worked the last two years I

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,399
don't see why it should stop now so

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,290
let's do the thing where we make people

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,300
put hand up in the air shall we because

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,950
no one else has done that today hands up

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,170
if you've got a blog on your WordPress

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,809
site hands up if you blog once a year

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,570
hands up if you blog once a month hands

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,550
up if you plug once a week hands up if

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,570
you haven't posted a blog in a very long

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,909
time yes I thought so and one of the

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,520
main reasons that people don't post blog

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,650
posts it's because they feel like no one

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,049
reads them let's be honest writing a

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,270
blog post takes quite a long time and

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,680
then when we post it and we wait for the

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,420
comments to come in and there's no

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,310
comments and no one shows it on social

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,840
media it's a little bit depressing so we

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,840
think well let's not do that again

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,369
so today I'm going to give you well I

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,650
think it might be ten might be twelve

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,790
reasons why no one is reading your blog

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,150
posts and just to be slightly helpful

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,229
how to change that as well okay so for

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,000
those of you who don't know I am

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,530
everything NYX heads is pretty much

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,240
wrong I have a speak I guess I'm an

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,740
entrepreneur but that sounds such a

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,990
wanky thing to say that I don't like

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,229
saying it I have two core businesses the

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,060
recipe for yes for SEO success where I

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,610
teach small business owners ecommerce

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,060
stores vloggers copywriters marketers

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,390
etc how to win love from the Google

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,430
beast without sacrificing their soul my

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,990
other business is the clever copywriting

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,509
school where I teach copywriters have

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,610
all to have successful happy healthy

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,670
lives we've got some stragglers coming

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,470
in come on stragglers

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:20,260
come on get up it says and also I began

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,750
life as a copywriter and I built my own

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,239
site in WordPress I've actually built

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,610
seven sites in WordPress I don't know

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,400
why I haven't seven web sites it's a lot

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,810
of work but I am a huge WordPress fan I

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,590
think this is my sixth or seventh

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,780
WordPress speaking so yeah I'm a big fan

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,130
so this is a slide that I meant to show

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,810
while I was saying all of that but I

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,160
forgot to show it so I'll just leave

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,580
this here for a couple of seconds for

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,250
you to look at I'm joking I will move on

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,980
now there's a prize here can anyone put

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,780
their hand up and shout really loudly

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,540
how many blog posts they think are

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,150
posted every single day on the interwebs

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,950
so anyone want to put their hand up 11

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,630
did you say sorry 11 it's slightly more

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:11,709
five billion okay

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:18,840
slightly less no one two because just

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:23,290
all shout numbers it's four million

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,299
every single day but I found that by

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,280
googling I guess if I googled it again

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,920
I'd probably get a different figure yeah

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,090
it's they go you saw my slides earlier

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,609
this is what you get from for cheating

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,489
four billion blog posts every single day

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:41,250
which just sounds insane the percentage

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,260
of those that are probably read is

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,400
substantially less might just stop we

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,670
should I just stop for a minute and let

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,410
people come in I'm sorry to you you're

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:57,420
to blame it's all your fault

00:03:50,410 --> 00:04:04,170
get out what should we do while waiting

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:08,660
sing a song okay do a quiz okay do you

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:11,100
what does SEO stand for there we go

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,569
whoever said that we've won a prize

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,560
come and get claim it come and claim it

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,670
at the end okay let's when everyone

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,790
comes through the door let's guess what

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:26,070
the name is okay next person that's

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:33,900
Susan okay next person Jeannine Mary

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:38,669
yeah no idea there's no more I think

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,520
we're done really can someone go and

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,560
like gather them right with a prod we'll

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,570
keep on going so four million blog posts

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,400
I guess the point here is then how on

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,710
earth do you get your blog post read

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,180
with all that noise there's a lot of

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,270
noise in this room at the moment as well

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,300
be quiet should say I'm getting bossy

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,910
now how do you get your blog post read

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,740
and not just by anybody but by customers

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,380
who want to buy from you any of you saw

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,150
wills presentation earlier you know the

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,340
whole point of us being out there in

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,830
content marketing is so that people buy

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,540
our services buy our stuff there's no

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,070
point blogging for the sake of blogging

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,840
which is what I think a lot of people do

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,440
and what I'm going to talk about today

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,020
so blogging is not always the right

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,720
answer when I started my business which

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,410
is about 11 years ago life was a lot

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,660
easier

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,919
Google is easier you could just post a

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,330
few things and you are top of the

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,040
rankings everyone thinks I'm amazing

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,419
that I ranked number one for copywriter

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,970
not SEO but they go it's still it's so

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,500
good I'll take it blogging these those

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,660
we have we did we have so many more

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,190
options you know we have Facebook live

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,840
we have Facebook groups they didn't

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,570
exist when I started Instagram didn't

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,250
exist podcasting has been around for

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,960
ages but it's really only now kind of

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,700
really getting really exciting for small

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,490
business people to do email marketing

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,260
obviously hugely powerful video all of

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,229
us are able to have our own TV channel

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,789
publish your own content imagine that 20

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,820
years ago that you could actually make

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,930
videos and put them out there insane

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,400
LinkedIn is getting huge especially my

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,410
favorite social media platform at the

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,180
moment I know it's boring and full of

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,870
weirdos but there's a lot of cut through

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,550
there and you know that what the

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,890
differences about people on LinkedIn

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,860
rather than Instagram they've got money

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,330
because they're business people so post

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,740
on Instagram all you like you'll get

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,440
lots of mums you don't have any money

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,700
who can't afford your services and like

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,560
well I've only got fifty dollars isn't

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,520
that enough to build a website No

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,380
so blogging is one piece of the content

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
marketing pie and it's not right for

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,640
everything so if I'm going to launch a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,320
course I don't sit around and write 20

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,120
blog post and publish them week after

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,770
week after week I'm going to launch of

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,290
course I'm going to get on social media

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,620
I'm gonna do excerpts testimonials short

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,910
videos Facebook wives q and A's podcasts

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm gonna get my name out there I'm not

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,360
gonna blog because blogging is a slow

00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,790
burn yeah I have 280 blogs on my website

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,950
it took me a long time to write them but

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,470
the other fact about putting content out

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,010
there on your website is that it lasts

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,490
forever

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,560
it's still there so post I wrote in 2009

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,410
are still consistently delivering

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,290
traffic to my site years later and not

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,540
just traffic but traffic that converts

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,950
but for many of you you are not getting

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,870
your blog's read you're looking at

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,280
statistics on Google going wow ten

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,360
people look to that blog last month

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,340
that's depressing

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,320
so today I'm going to give you some

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,630
reasons why that's happening and some

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,690
ideas of how to fix them so the first

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,870
one is you don't have a clear goal you

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,910
just believe the myth that Google wants

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,820
you to publish a web blog post every

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,060
week Google doesn't give a crap Google

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,710
doesn't reward consistent publishers

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,250
regular publishers it doesn't even

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,520
reward new content Google rewards the

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,340
best content so there is a tiny part of

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,790
the algorithm called qtf which is query

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,490
deserves freshness but that only applies

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,250
to kind of content that needs to be

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,830
fresh so who here watches The Bachelor

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,620
put your hand up Nick I know you do he's

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,630
watching it now on his phone if I'm

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,970
doing asking about The Bachelor I don't

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,550
want to search on Google and find a post

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,860
about last year's bachelor

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,020
about this year's bachelor so for that

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,330
instance Google will seek out content

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,640
that's fresh but if I'm writing a blog

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,560
post about how to write a press release

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,300
how to write a press release hasn't

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,070
really changed for the last five years

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,060
so it's not going to pick the newest

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,970
post it's gonna pick the most

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,260
comprehensive well researched extensive

00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:42,270
linked to socially popular posts yeah so

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,160
never post just because you think you

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,380
ought to just because you want to feed

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,830
the Google beast the Google beast will

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,780
wait for better content so what are

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,970
valuable and valid reasons to publish

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,810
blogs well the first one is called eat

00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,960
does anyone know what this means

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:03,180
expertise Authority and Trust now this

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,580
is important from a commercial point of

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,350
view from a buying point of view if you

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,510
are the expert in your field if you are

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,640
the authority if people trust you

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,080
they're more likely to buy from you but

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,510
it's actually increasingly part of

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,500
Google's algorithm now unlike lots of

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,330
the other things that have been talked

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,060
about today and like Tony's presentation

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,130
for example 3 second speed crawl ability

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,930
responsiveness all that stuff it's very

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,360
easy it's very black-and-white isn't it

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,370
easier sites three seconds or it's 27

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,290
how on earth do you measure expertise

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,200
Authority and Trust it's a bit more

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,820
abstract in ethereal well Google looks

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,650
for signals it looks for what you're

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,710
writing about what you're talking about

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:43,650
so if it consistently sees the name KT

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,240
Tilden and and copywriting over time

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,070
it's going to understand that KT Tilden

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,080
is a copy writer if she starts to talk

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,210
about a particular type of copywriting

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,800
it's gonna make that association again

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,990
Google is building up a digital

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,310
footprint for all of us which is why

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,040
it's so good at knowing what we're

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,420
thinking in the middle of the night so

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,890
eat is really important I'm gonna talk a

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,920
bit more about eat in a second

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,670
the next thing blog posting allows us to

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,500
do is solve customer problems so if I I

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,600
don't sit there waiting for someone's

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
blog to come out off it's really looking

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
forward to reading that blog post today

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,420
and it's not come out where is their

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,130
email no if I have a problem I go onto

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,560
Google and I search for something and I

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,240
read a blog and if that blog solves my

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,130
problem really well and I really enjoy

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,080
that content maybe I'll

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,330
up to their newsletter or follow their

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,980
social media maybe I'll recommend that

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,080
article to someone else or do what

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,910
everyone does save the blog in a folder

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,350
on my desktop and then save more and

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,820
more articles there until the fault it

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,380
gets really big and depressing and then

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,020
I delete 6 I'm never gonna read them all

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,390
and then I make another folder and start

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,120
it all over again but if someone solves

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,650
my problem I already like them I'm

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,780
already warming up to them they've

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,140
helped me I'm going to remember that

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,820
even if it was only in written format

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,470
the next thing it enables to do is sell

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,140
without selling who here feels like

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:06,360
there are a natural salesperson anybody

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,890
ok Nick of course it's hard to sell you

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,420
know most of us feel a bit icky about it

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,610
we feel it's a bit American I mean it

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,110
isn't if someone had a disease and you

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,210
have to cure then all you'll do is

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,580
explaining it to them and you know we'll

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,840
talked about some sales ideas earlier

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,120
about you know really making things

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,010
targeted and you know really identifying

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,410
what people's issues are but blogging

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,780
allows us to more subtly sell you know

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,250
we're helping someone solve a problem

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,260
but we're also talking about why we are

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,390
awesome at what we do and then at the

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,640
end you know we talked about giving out

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,290
our information and helping people and

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,550
some people I would tell people what I

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,890
do because then they won't hire me

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,420
believe me they will because often I

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,910
read that blog post that says the best

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,220
way to improve your site speed is to do

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,840
this this this this and I'm like great I

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,880
don't want to do any of that can you do

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,980
it for me that's my attitude at the end

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,400
so you can sell your services without

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,200
doing the hard sell the next thing is

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,620
that it's another ticket in the SEO

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,810
lottery so Google looks at sites as a

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,870
whole and judges them as a whole entity

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,240
but it also judges every post every page

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,300
and every product that you put on your

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,250
site as an individual ticket so you're

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,560
writing a keyword on that ticket and yet

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,600
popping it into Google's thing and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,910
you're giving yourself more chance to

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,630
win now of course it's about quality not

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,360
quantity

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,800
but if nick has a 5 page website tony

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,870
has a 20 page website

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,390
Tony start probably gonna win and he's

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,450
got better hat the other thing that it's

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,250
going to do is drive traffic so this is

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,589
my this is not a great example it's been

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,430
a slow week on one of my websites but

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,830
you can see that

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:45,330
organic site organic search traffic for

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,610
that week was 1,000 users now I haven't

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,490
done any advertising paid advertising on

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,720
my site ever I've done once or twice and

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,820
a little bit of Google remarketing but

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,430
I've never paid for an ounce it's got

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,140
ten scible with me so all my traffic

00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,940
comes through content marketing now I

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,010
have not published a blog on that site

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,450
for ten months but I'm still getting a

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,550
thousand visitors in that particular

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,529
week just by doing nothing just by

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,930
people searching on the internet finding

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,970
articles coming to my site if I showed

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,339
you some other metrics my time on sites

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,080
it's pretty high and my number of pages

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,490
views is usually three four or five

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,080
which means they're coming and they're

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,110
looking at multiple pages and that's

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,480
content I wrote years ago so it stands

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,399
the test of time yeah so it drives

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,779
traffic obviously and hopefully if

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,660
you've used the relevant keywords

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,250
relevant traffic so those are some of

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,450
the things that you need to think about

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,250
when you've got a goal what am I trying

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,320
to do am I trying to sell am I trying to

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,810
get Google ranking do I want another

00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,880
ticket in the SEO lottery but the next

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,380
reason why your blogs aren't doing well

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,620
is you really don't understand this

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,080
expertise authority and trust thing so

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,839
you need to learn how to improve your

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,430
expertise or authority and Trust now

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,260
here are some little tips on how you can

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,640
do that yeah we want Google to think

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,860
that you are the expert in your field

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,450
how do we make Google do that well the

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,600
first thing you can do is write a really

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,310
strong about Us page you don't need the

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
US by the way you don't need to pronoun

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,330
it's your website who else is it going

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,209
to be about this is Bupers they need a

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,279
good copywriter but on your about Us

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,040
page you know this is the about Us page

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,209
isn't really about you it's about what

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,760
you can do for me

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,650
so that page is a page to talk about

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,040
what you've done who you've done it for

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,450
your approach your values any

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,060
associations you've in your in any

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,650
courses you've done but every time you

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,320
write a sentence you should be saying to

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,750
yourself so what I have 10 years

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,190
experience as a wordpress developer

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,050
excellent so what what does that mean

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,000
well it means I've seen every pretty

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,220
much every problem a site can have and

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,680
I've worked out solutions for them you

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,390
know I used to work at such-and-such so

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,860
what well at that job I learned

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,260
diplomacy and community

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,930
skills and that makes it really easy to

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,480
work with and really amicable yeah when

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,390
someone comes to your website they

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,980
already serve I all they want you to do

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,690
is make them feel good about the

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,149
purchase decision they're going to make

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,410
and an about page is a great thing to do

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:09,180
that if you look at your Google

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,730
Analytics you may see the about pages up

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,480
there in the most viewed pages because I

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,190
could go and hire a big flashy WordPress

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,589
business to build my website but if I

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,930
feel a connection with you if I like you

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,790
then I want to work with you so tell me

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,970
who you are you know otherwise I won't

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,890
know if you are publishing content on

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,190
other people's sites the other thing you

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,500
need is a really strong bio this is an

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,740
example of a poor bio great writer pull

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,300
bio so when if you are lucky enough to

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,130
be able to publish a guest post on

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,200
someone else's site your little bi

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,910
usually get about 50 words and you get a

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,220
link back to your site make that work

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,079
for you talk about your experience what

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,180
you're passionate about maybe put

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,890
something fun in there as well so the

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,089
Google that buyer is going to be seen

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,920
again and again it's gonna be on

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,860
multiple articles and Google's going to

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,930
build up that digital footprint social

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,000
signals are important there's a big you

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,790
know debate about how much as social

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,100
influences ranking but clearly social

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,620
has other benefits it builds your brand

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,870
it builds connections so you know I

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,070
don't think as a professional WordPress

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,740
developer or really a professional

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,120
anything in digital marketing you can

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,649
put yourself out there and not be on

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,930
Twitter Instagram LinkedIn and Facebook

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,730
I think you know whether you like them

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,680
or not it's not about you it's about

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,329
where your customers are and your

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
customers are on these platforms and if

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,640
you're not there they're going to be

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
like oh I don't know do they really know

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,870
their stuff

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,089
so social signals are important the next

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,829
thing is Google Maps you know like we

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,480
think Tony mentioned Google my business

00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,600
we should all have a Google my business

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,490
profile I mean come on it's free it's

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,519
free real estate from Google you can now

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,610
publish posts on it products offers you

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,959
can get reviews reviews so powerful they

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,850
don't influence ranking but they

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,170
influence click-through rate and it's

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,790
free real estate you don't have to

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,380
publish your real address on there and

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,020
you have a chance of getting in the

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,190
local pack in your local area and if

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,150
we're in the local pack you're going to

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,890
get the click

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,410
another thing you can do is hire really

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,329
amazing writers so look if you are not

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,069
the best blog post writer or you're

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,410
writing about a particular discipline

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,319
hire someone to do it for you get some

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,240
decent cornerstone solid articles on

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,949
your blog post so when people come to

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,569
your site it's really clear that you

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,980
know you know what you're doing but you

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,390
don't tell them you've got a copywriter

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,339
to write them you tend you wrote them

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,650
yourself but you know if you are not

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,630
confident write something get an editor

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,490
or a copywriter to read over it for you

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,260
you know I'm not a great WordPress

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,790
developer I have other people to help

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,050
you with that you know you don't have to

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,780
do all your own and it's a good

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,640
investment the other thing of course to

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,280
do is build up your reputation with

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,920
Google and online by getting reviews and

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,630
testimonials you know it's something I

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,670
would say to you every week per an hour

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,679
in your diary to go out to some previous

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,570
clients and just say please review me

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,100
and don't get them to email you that

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,470
review get them to put it on a social

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,670
site you want to unlink Tim you want it

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,650
on Google my business you want it on

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,390
Facebook you want that social proof and

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,140
then you cut and paste it and pop it on

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,870
your own site

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,660
so that's each building up your Google's

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,860
picture of you as an expert the next

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,870
thing is you don't understand your

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,820
audience and we all think we do you know

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,040
we all heard of demographic studies this

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,690
is Clive Clive is 49 it drives a

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,090
Landrover he's married to Susan they

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,669
have 2.7 children a dog called Bernard

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,100
you know but really if we know that

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,559
demographic information about Clive we

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,059
don't know how Clive oh we don't know

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,460
how Clive really feels we don't know

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,490
what anything about v we've created this

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,950
really crappy avatar of a fake human so

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,620
the method I like to use is called BBF

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,480
it's a really simple acronym to just

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,480
explain how to dig a bit deeper into our

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,970
customers problems so what it stands for

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,540
is understanding someone's preconceived

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:55,000
beliefs deepest desires and darkest

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,710
fears so I'm going to pick a volunteer

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,690
from the audience I'm picking you

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:04,059
because you made eye contact what do you

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:05,679
do for a living okay so what would be

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,340
someone's pre conceived belief about a

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,340
book keeper

00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:17,470
and I'd met you and you are really

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,429
boring now a frequency police will be

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,749
maybe that you're boring that your

00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,100
numbers person you're maybe not a great

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:23,200
communicator

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,090
what's the deepest desire when you hire

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,619
a bookkeeper that you never have to do

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,019
that stuff again and it's all going to

00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:31,330
be done seamlessly and perfectly the

00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,889
darkest fear is that it won't be you're

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,330
going to mess up or then you're gonna be

00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,789
expensive I mean that's a fear with

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,889
hiring any service provider so we need

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,929
to address these fears in our blog posts

00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,239
ten reasons why you need to hire a

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,710
bookkeeper pretty cheesy or why I'm a

00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,849
communicative bookkeeper

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,899
you know those ways of doing it you know

00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:52,179
affordable bookkeeping weddings and

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,889
giving people ways of doing things for

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,049
free themselves so that you show that

00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:57,609
you're a generous giving person the

00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:58,629
classic one is lawyers you know we all

00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,029
think lawyers are going to talk in

00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:03,460
legalese they're gonna overcharge us

00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:05,320
they're gonna bamboozle us so blog for

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,590
lawyers write blog posts that counter

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,869
those fears and feed those desires and

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,460
get break down those preconceived

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,989
beliefs then they're going to they're

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,929
going to win more customers but the

00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:19,539
other acronym I like to use is the CGF

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,070
and this is I have forgot what it is

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,519
again I went blank the other day

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,460
Clive googling fear so this is back to

00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,859
Clive we need to get into the kind of

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,109
searches that Clive does at 2:00 a.m. in

00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,399
the morning when he wakes up and finds a

00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,729
rash in his groin

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,529
what is he typing into Google anybody in

00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:40,720
this room if I take your laptop and look

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,619
at your Google search history I would

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,149
find some dark could someone volunteer

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,679
this is one thing you do soon as you

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,739
start a relationship with anybody you'd

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,080
learn how to clear your Google search

00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:54,369
history very important if you want to

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,460
find out how I'll show you after the

00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:59,889
session but those kind of searches are

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,289
the ones that really hit home if I can

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:05,470
be the person that tells Clive what the

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,539
rash in his groin is and get rid of his

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,909
fear and that drives sleep a little bit

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,679
better he's gonna remember me and next

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:16,330
time he gets that rash is coming back to

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:19,360
buy my aunt meat I don't sell I went for

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,610
rashes so sorry Nick

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,350
the next thing that people get wrong a

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,810
lot is they don't understand search

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,130
intense so Google is all about search

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,410
for and said there was an algorithm

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,210
update called hummingbird which was

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,070
about understanding that when someone

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,020
types certain words into Google they

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,670
mean things Google used to be very good

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,040
at understand what we're searching for

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,150
now it's good at understanding why we're

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,790
searching for it

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,040
so the example I always use is piglet

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,200
jumpers it's a terrible example I'm as

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,240
sick of it as you are but if someone

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,380
types piglet jumpers into Google what do

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,730
they want what do they want sir oh you

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,710
didn't hear what I said I thought I said

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,640
it quite loud what would somebody typed

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,200
piglet jumpers into Google won a jumper

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,700
for Pig do they want to jump up for

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,060
their piglet or a jumper with a piglet

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,650
on it do they actually want a jumper or

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,210
do they want to see pictures of jumpers

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,400
they want to see little piggies and

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,160
jumpers running around on YouTube videos

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,310
we don't know but as soon as someone

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,190
puts buy in front of that word we know

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,650
they have transaction intents as soon as

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,220
someone puts how to make in front of

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,980
that keyword

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,230
we know they have informational intents

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,120
yeah so it's the words around our

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,070
keywords that help Google deliver the

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,660
right content you type piglet jumpers

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,820
into Google you'll get pictures and

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,700
you'll get videos you type buy you'll

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,040
get shops yeah straight away so it's

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,290
really important so there are four types

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,880
of search or intent you could possibly

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,970
say there's a fifth which is location

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,580
intent but transactional informational

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,580
investigational and navigational so

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,930
transactional is pretty obvious by

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,490
informational is I want to answer a

00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,770
question I want to know something I have

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,090
a question I need an answer

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,310
investigational is comparison I'm

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,020
thinking about buying this this which is

00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,540
better you know things like versa vice

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,010
versa reviews testimonials and

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,600
navigational is just I want to get

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,940
somewhere on the interwebs I want to get

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,410
to net banks login page so you don't

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,900
want to rank for that unless you

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,730
literally are net banks login page so

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,920
when we are thinking in blogging terms

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,470
we are purely in informational and

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,210
investigational yeah we are answering

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,160
questions we are helping we are

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,070
providing information we're not about

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,330
navigation and we're not about transact

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,380
save all that kind of stuff for your

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,580
ecommerce pages and your sales pages so

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,060
somebody earlier today talked about the

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:42,930
funnel the funnel starts with tofu then

00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:45,420
mo food not mofo then both foo top of

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,700
funnel middle of funnel bottom of funnel

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,420
we are all in the top of funnel when

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,640
we're blogging

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,280
these are people who want what we do but

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,770
they don't know that we do it yeah

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,300
they are probably problem aware but

00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,580
they're maybe not even solution aware

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,130
they are not brand aware so someone who

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,110
wants what used specifically will type

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,400
your brand into Google somebody wants

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,200
the product that you sell because

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,000
they've heard of it will type that into

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,680
Google so for me it would be like if

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,630
someone heard of my course they type in

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,730
the recipe for SEO success or Kate toons

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,290
SEO course you know if they've heard of

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,810
the course they might type in SEO

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,040
nibbles or 10-day challenge but if

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,470
they're just prop them aware they might

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,480
type in why does Google not like my

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,400
website and if I've got a post that

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
answers that I'm starting to get them in

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,940
my funnel they're tofu they sign up to

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,430
my newsletter that if I find out they

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,190
can't escape so we are in tofu learned

00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,810
so don't try and do the hard sell at

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,220
this point you know it's like networking

00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,170
event where someone rushes up with their

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,750
business card you just introduce

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,580
yourself first the next thing is that

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,110
people don't do any keyword research who

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,610
does you know a couple of hours of

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,190
comprehensive keyword research every

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,540
time they write a blog post anyone

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,710
you're a weirdo I don't even do it so I

00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,020
recommend that keyword research is

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,580
something that you do in batches yes you

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,870
do a lot of big some deep keyword

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,490
research and that should last you two or

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,470
three months you should get enough

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,870
intelligence out of that to generate

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,910
enough keywords for your pages and your

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,630
products and some blog posts so it's not

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,180
something you have to do every single

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,010
time so when it comes to keyword

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,140
research the first step is to brainstorm

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,760
you know so you're maybe wanting to I'll

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,070
use the bookkeeping example you're maybe

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,110
you want you to talk about you know bath

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,510
you know bass is coming up or you want

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,850
to talk about zero or y zero is better

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,560
than my DOB yeah so the first thing you

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,870
do is you going to write down 0 and y OB

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,010
why is it better vice-versa you know

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,720
right anything that comes into your

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,430
heads

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,320
comparison example you know you're just

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,169
gonna blurt it all out no ideas a bad

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,179
idea

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,519
and then you can use tools like this so

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,169
these are heaps of tools you can use to

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,899
take those keywords you've got and drop

00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:49,059
them in and see what generates because

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:50,980
these short keywords these head keywords

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,200
these one-word keywords would never get

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,179
a rank for them we need longtail

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,480
keywords keywords that are four or five

00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:01,989
or six phrases long all of these are

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,389
free apart from SEM rush an SEM rush has

00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:06,460
the best data so you know but for most

00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:09,039
of us a great tool that we can use for

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,109
blogging is answer the public so if you

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,340
put in like a zero in to answer the

00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:14,049
public it will tell you all the

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,980
questions people have asked about zero

00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,679
on the Internet

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,690
why is zero so expensive is zero the

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,989
best solution for small business is zero

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,759
better than my OB great I've gotten a

00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:26,679
nice little title for my blog post now

00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,539
so we can use my another really good one

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,999
is keyword sorry

00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,649
it's it generates just thousands and

00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,869
thousands of keywords it's really great

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:37,749
most of them are insane but sometimes

00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:39,700
you find a journal so once we have found

00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:41,499
our keywords what are we looking for

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,279
we're trying to find keywords that have

00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:47,769
high traffic and low competition yeah

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,169
and we also want to have keywords that

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:51,519
have the right intent so we for blogging

00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,350
we don't want to go after keywords that

00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,429
have the words buy or affordable because

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,279
that's the wrong intent we're in

00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,489
information world we're in investigation

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,159
world so we can use this is sem rush and

00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:05,019
you can see here at the top if I can

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,539
point it out it tells you the traffic

00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:09,759
that the keywords getting and then you

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,100
can see them the volume the keyword

00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,109
difficulty the cost per click is if you

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,489
were to buy it yeah because if you as a

00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:17,889
pay for some of these keywords you if

00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:20,499
you're saying like you know $15 a click

00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:22,570
just a click and I haven't got that kind

00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:24,580
of money so you can use tools like SEM

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,980
rush to find out what keywords you're

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,659
already ranking for what contents

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,129
already doing well maybe all you need to

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,169
do is tweet content you've already got

00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:34,119
maybe you don't need to write a new blog

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:35,649
post maybe you need to improve a blog

00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,960
post you already have written or

00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:40,149
combined a few old crappy ones into one

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,830
new good one so you can use tools like

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,940
that obviously a great thing to do as

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,739
well it's looking you compared to the

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,239
keywords pop their URL what are they

00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:47,679
ranking for is through another

00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:49,330
bookkeeper in your area that's been a

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,850
great blog post then you're not going to

00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,260
steal

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,850
going to be inspired by and you're going

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,130
to do a better job of it it's called the

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,200
skyscraper ring so you take that blog

00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,910
post and they've written 500 words you

00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,520
write 2,000 words and have a checklist

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:05,340
in it in a video now you do a better job

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,170
of that bill post you can also use

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,540
Google search console Google the search

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,220
console all the keyword data that was in

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,230
Google AdWords that we can't get out as

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,210
easily it's now in Google search console

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,100
so we can see what we're ranking for we

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,230
can see the volume its generating and

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,120
the cost per click so you know I'm not

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,470
expecting to explain the whole world of

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,050
keyword research to you in five minutes

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,700
but it's something to think about even

00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,440
the choice between this keyword and this

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,420
keyword there's just slightly different

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,820
volumes can make huge differences to how

00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,410
your blog ranks and how many visitors

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,190
you get and therefore how much traffic

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,030
you get and how many conversions you get

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,410
once you've done that you need to group

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,270
things together so one thing that people

00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,680
really misunderstand about keywords is

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,060
they think they need to have every

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,760
keyword they can think of they need to

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,320
have a piece of content for it no you

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,480
don't do that what you do is you think

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,660
about the search or intent so if you

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,540
come up with like my OB versus zero and

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,310
then which is better my OB or zero would

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,960
you do two separate blogs about those so

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,460
different keywords no you wouldn't

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,440
because the search for intent is the

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,150
same someone who is happy with that

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,640
keyword will be happy with the same

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,980
article so you generally trying to find

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,530
a focus keyword which is going to be the

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,650
one that is the best and then synonyms

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,420
other phrases that are similar so

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,330
keyword research is a bit of a rabbit

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,490
hole even if all you tried to do is when

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,350
you write your next blog post just think

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,570
what would someone type into Google to

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,350
find this blog post that even if that's

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,730
all you do

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,010
you're doing more than most people are

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,560
doing so the next place where people

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,300
fail it's readability yeah so the

00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,040
average readability age in Australia

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:43,980
what does anyone think it is grades year

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:46,380
what it's for it's seven so it's seven

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,870
grades seven and yet a lot of the blog

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,060
posts that I put through this tool I'll

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,280
come back to it this one here Hemingway

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,720
which is a free tool online the

00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,120
readability age that you need to have is

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,370
graduate level and that's not because

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,620
you're writing to see agent copy it's

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,110
because you're writing really badly you

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,929
have a long sentences

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,030
complex sentences you've used semicolons

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,130
no one knows how to use a semicolon

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,410
not even me and I get paid money to be a

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,330
copywriter useful stops shorter

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,010
sentences you've used the passive voice

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,780
rather than the active voice we don't

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,360
know we're doing it we all think we can

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,740
write that we can't and this tool will

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,870
tell you all the mistakes you've made

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,030
and the other thing to remember and this

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,440
is a slider jump pass is that very few

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,080
people are going to read from the start

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,240
of your blog post to the end they're

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,799
going to jump around and looking for sub

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,350
headers and bits that they want to read

00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,940
how many of us do you scan the post you

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,880
find the little bit you read or you go

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,890
to the bottom where it says TL DR too

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,570
long didn't read and you read the five

00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,390
bullet points that sum up the whole blog

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,520
post so make it easy for people to

00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,530
forage don't make me come to your site

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,720
and see a big blob of coffee that looks

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,190
so intimidating I'm just going to click

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,850
away to someone else who's broken that

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,919
copy up and made it more readable so the

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,910
next problem that I find a lot with blog

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:03,950
post is that you don't consider

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,280
structure and from this point I'm

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,929
talking about writing structure so at

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,330
school notice this were told when we

00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:14,809
write something you needs to have a

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:17,059
beginning middle and end you said like

00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,790
it's a ham sandwich bread ham bread and

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:22,220
now with a blog post it looks more like

00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,330
this it's like bread ham salad more

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,470
breads another patty cheese whatever

00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,760
because blog post should go on and on

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,679
I'm going to talk about length at the

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,510
end yeah so you have a beginning middle

00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,120
and ends what you do when you're writing

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,650
a blog post is you need to very quickly

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,870
tell people what they're going to get

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,010
from reading this blog posts one thing

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,480
you can do as well is there's a little

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,940
plugin in WordPress that will calculate

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,570
the read reading time for your blog

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,730
posts so use that it's really great I

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:52,610
can't remember probably something like

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,870
WP reading time because they're all so

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,760
imaginative but I'll try and remember

00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,890
and I'll tweet it later share on

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,140
Instagram but what you need to do is at

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,669
the beginning of the articles say in

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,950
this article I'm going to tell you this

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:06,320
and by the end of the article you will

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,510
able to be able to do this understand

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,820
this problem under whatever so you tell

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,640
them what you're gonna do you say what

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,650
you're gonna say then you say it and at

00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,970
the end you say this is what I told you

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,770
you summit back

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,929
again Stephanie blogpost I read just

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,760
kind of go you have any bid it and they

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,400
just stop and there's no conclusion it's

00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,230
like oh we're done okay alright you need

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,120
to finish what you've started and

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,159
reiterate the points that you've made or

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,750
the one point so I often finish a blog

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,980
post so saying so if there's one thing

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,010
you take from this article

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,059
remember blah and then they take one

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,860
thing from your article and they

00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:41,659
remember it so you need to do a good

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,360
intro paragraph you need to do short

00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,640
paragraphs and 50 to 60 words a hundred

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,620
words no longer and then every paragraph

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,030
have a sub header where every two

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,309
paragraphs that says what the next

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,200
paragraph is about so I can scan the

00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:56,120
whole article and maybe just read two or

00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,640
three it doesn't matter as long as I get

00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,309
my problem solved I've established some

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,020
kind of bond with you use quotes to

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:05,570
break up the content just to make it

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,250
easier to read and digest use images try

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,780
to move the eye from the left to the

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,169
right and the right to the left so move

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,360
the images around on the page linked to

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:16,970
reputable sources like link out of a see

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,059
in a new window have a conclusion and

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,730
then ask a question you want comments

00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:24,950
comments a free copy free Google

00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,960
friendly copy saturated with Google

00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,240
keywords that you didn't have to write

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,429
and most people will read the comments

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,320
often before they read the article if

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,640
you use heat map studies especially if

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,809
it's a controversial topic they'll go

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,570
straight to the bottom and read the

00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:39,950
fighting at the bottom and comments also

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,470
give you an opportunity to have a

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,760
relationship with your readers I really

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,370
hated this article I thought it was

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,809
really badly written and I'm you've

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,520
wasted six minutes of my life

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,929
I'm sorry Clive I'm sorry that you feel

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,850
that way at least you get to have a chat

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,650
with Clive and maybe you win Clive over

00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,669
and he remembers you but at least not

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,679
other people get to read that

00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:01,039
interaction have a bit of a giggle which

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,950
is important so consider structure the

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,169
best blog posts are Wiggly they go in

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,899
and out and in and out long sentences

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:11,050
short sentences images quotes sub

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,980
headers if your post doesn't wiggle

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,200
something's gone wrong if it's block

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,050
block block I'm clicking off to someone

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,240
else's site the next reason is you don't

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,099
consider layout now we have Guttenberg

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,379
most of us have turned the editor off I

00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,570
have driving around the twist I try to

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:27,370
use it with Divi

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,530
nice dilution my blogs either I just

00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,880
can't code them let's not get into it

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,760
you hate Divi we're not gonna have that

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,650
fight again whatever you do whether you

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,500
use whatever thing you use just try to

00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:41,230
think about breaking up your content

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:44,800
with whitespace give the eye a rest

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,930
so don't just have chunk chunk chunk use

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,580
bullet points wherever you can every

00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:51,220
time you get to and this bullet it out

00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,530
makes it really easy to read especially

00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,300
if your audience is male if I ever want

00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,740
my partner to do anything I put it in

00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,150
bullet points I try and write a full

00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,560
sentence this is what's the point of

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,470
sending that email he's never going to

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,330
understand it and short paragraphs keep

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,550
them short people have slow attention

00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,160
spans they struggle I struggle people

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,170
don't read online like they read books

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,970
have them wiggle and remember and I'm

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,490
never to fully justify copy

00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,140
you know how books are this wide it's

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,970
because the eye cannot connect to the

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,610
next line if you go any wider than that

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,800
it's at 16 words then that eye loses its

00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,480
place on the page same happens with web

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,100
which is why more lots of blogs have a

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,050
sidebar down the side just it makes it

00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,330
easier to have that padding on either

00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:34,660
side makes the content easier to connect

00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,800
and connect so yeah that's whitespace if

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,990
you don't know what it is because I feel

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,440
like lots of developers don't know what

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:44,080
white spaces lots of designers use white

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,610
space too much but every go the next

00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,500
thing is you don't write like a human

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,880
for some reason we're not those of us

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,170
who aren't confident writers when we

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,300
start writing blog posts we start

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,430
getting into this really weird formal

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,890
way of writing let's lose lots of long

00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,620
words no you are having a conversation

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,790
with one reader thank you with one

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,220
reader that's the other thing as well

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,440
never talked about our customers always

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,330
talk about you there is one pair of

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,390
eyeballs reading that article at a time

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,070
so talk directly to the person so you

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,620
need to write like a human and how do

00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,530
humans talk well we don't say it is a

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,750
lovely day today we say it's a lovely

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,150
day we don't say we will be going to the

00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,470
pub later for beer we say will they're

00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,530
going to the pub later for beer we

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:29,170
contract our words we don't use cliches

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,690
and overly used edom idioms if you're

00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,550
worried that a cliched writer there's a

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,260
great little tool called cliche finder

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,760
so you can just pop your copy in and it

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,820
will find all your cliches

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,650
and we use customer language because

00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,140
people are typing stuff into Google

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,640
Google's pretty good that it can't

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,530
always make the connection and the

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,330
example I've used ad nauseam but I'll

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,520
use it again is when I use the right

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:54,580
content from Randwick Council and they

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,850
wanted the red lid bid bin page I can

00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,740
never say it red lid bin try saying that

00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:02,800
later on tonight they wanted it called

00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:05,620
called the garbage receptacle collection

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,230
units because that's what we call them

00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,890
in Council that's what Barry calls them

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,350
and Barry was the head of refuse he was

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,060
determined and then that we had we had

00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,200
three meetings which always paid for so

00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,660
I didn't mind about whether there were

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,270
red bins or red lid bins bring your hand

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,210
up if you say red bin put your hand up

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,060
if you say red lip in the red bin people

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:33,750
you're all wrong the bin isn't red the

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:36,550
lid is red so you've customer language

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,660
use the terms that people use and you

00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,250
know especially there's lots of

00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,170
WordPress developers in the room word

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,590
for you youth every day mean nothing to

00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:46,360
us caching caching what does that mean

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,620
and you throw it out there like we're

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,610
all supposed to understand what it means

00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:53,290
we don't you know backups of course I

00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,790
know our backup is you know I'm an

00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,530
accountant of course I know what that

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,390
means we don't know what you're talking

00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,950
about and the same through an accountant

00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,980
and you basically talk about anything

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:05,050
Saturn's done anything by countess's be

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,080
playful as well I don't be afraid of

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:11,140
having a bit of a personality

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,610
personalities aren't you know something

00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,020
negative to have in business they're

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,880
actually quite a good thing to have a

00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,980
personality and yes you won't be

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,200
everybody's cup of tea but you'll be

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,950
someone's cup of tea you know it's the

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,440
whole vanilla ice

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:25,290
who likes vanilla ice cream you're weird

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,910
you know

00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,980
you probably like vanilla ice cream but

00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,390
you have a fetish Emad about cookie

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,570
dough with this and blah blah blah you

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,640
know no one wants to be vanilla so be

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,290
playful now here's some great little

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,000
lines that you can use to break up your

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,860
content you know high so the chunk chunk

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,780
chunk well this is a great way of

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,580
breaking up the content so you've said

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,170
something and then you're about to talk

00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,180
about something else and you go okay

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,980
let's get stuck in you know I'm going to

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,630
talk to you about 10 WordPress plugins

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,720
that are really amazing okay let's get

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,610
stuck in here's the deal my top plug-in

00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,950
is this one and it does this in this

00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,110
exciting right and it gets better it

00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,460
also does this and this and yes it might

00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,140
sound a bit cheesy and I might take your

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,030
weight after use all of them but just

00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,530
try to use some little chatty phrases

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,790
and again you're gonna get that wiggle

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,670
on you cuz you can have short phrase

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,910
long for a short phrase long please the

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:20,200
next thing is your headlines suck

00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:22,810
especially WordPress bloggers God so

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,160
there are basically six different ways

00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,600
throughout a headline there's probably

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,670
more but I've decided there are six so

00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,180
we're all agree with me the first one is

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,520
statement it's not very inviting it's

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,600
kind of overconfident it doesn't really

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,940
work the next one is question is there

00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,100
an easier way to bathe piglets who

00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,590
doesn't want to read that article I want

00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,600
to read it right now the next one is how

00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,520
to this is to solving customer problems

00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,160
I've got a piglet I'm finding it really

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,690
difficult to bathe it how can I make

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,750
piglet but that's something Clive is

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,780
typing in at 2:00 a.m. 30 ways to bathe

00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,830
piglets now that is a that's an article

00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,420
that you gonna want to keep you're gonna

00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,700
want to bookmark you can I want to save

00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,180
it but what's so equally powerful is the

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,590
number one way to bathe piglets that's

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,520
really powerful because I could that's

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:15,040
achievable yeah my top three I can I can

00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,530
do three things three ways so baby

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,120
piglets you need to know today seven is

00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,460
really good as well seven works and

00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,590
obviously top tens if they actually are

00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,850
a top ten you know one hundred and

00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:29,020
seventy two ways to bathe piglets great

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,670
comprehensive gonna download it it's

00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,750
going in the folder and then the folders

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,400
getting deleted I'm never reading

00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,690
articles don't if you read anything by

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Brian Dean on

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,920
Patel that there so long I'm like this

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,869
is great guys but I can't get through it

00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,510
so I maybe read one paragraph and then I

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:46,300
move away reader addressing that's kind

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:49,450
of this urgency and then emotional tell

00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:52,540
a story how I paid link with how I made

00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,849
it in my life easier you know my story

00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,160
something personal every article you

00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:59,079
think of has already been written the

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,329
only thing that you bring to it is your

00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,579
personal experience okay I've only got

00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:05,890
five minutes left it's not dead fast so

00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:07,750
you can take screen grabs of the photos

00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,790
of these and get social media stuff if

00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,670
you share them headline generator tools

00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,260
Porton tools it's really good title

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,329
maker take a photo click I'm moving on

00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,730
I've got a sign from Nick I'm gonna go

00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:21,819
over time I don't care tweet your bids

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:25,390
this one's fun as well title generator I

00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:27,940
will share some of these on social blog

00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,130
idea generator has a weird fixation with

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,500
Miley Cyrus so whatever you put in it

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,329
will be like how I bathe my son how my

00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,000
and Cyrus told me to bathe my piglet

00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:39,940
easier and it's like well okay but it's

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,829
fun anyway so use those okay now

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,599
obviously we're getting into the SEO bit

00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:45,520
you don't optimize for the Google beast

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,990
now this isn't actually that hard you

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,670
should always write for humans first

00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:51,190
from Google second we know that we know

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,750
that so remember we've chose our focus

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:54,520
keyword earlier the phrase that we

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,109
really wanted to rank for and then we

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,060
came up with some synonyms that we might

00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:00,040
use as well so let me have our focus

00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,990
keyword on a pink post-it note on our

00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,760
screen we've written our wonderful

00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,300
article it's chatty it's Wiggly it's

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,060
great

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,930
then all we need to do is not overuse

00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,810
that word

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,359
we don't keywords stuff it doesn't work

00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,859
anymore it never did and it also offends

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,660
the reader we can all tell when an

00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:18,369
articles being written for Google so

00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,180
these are the only places you need to

00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:25,240
use your keyword the title tag is the

00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,030
number one front end your title tag so

00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,970
if your keyword that you've chosen is my

00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,440
B or zero which is better that's your

00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,300
title tag yeah you don't need to put

00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,950
your brand in because at this point no

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,150
one cares about your brand they wanted

00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,010
to find your brand that we're typing a

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,990
brand into Google so just have that you

00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,710
never sacrifice space in your title tag

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,730
for your brand

00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:47,560
use it in your url how to watch our my B

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,870
- Brisbane

00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,370
use it in your Meta Description but be

00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,350
aware that that's not used for ranking

00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:55,450
your Meta Description is an ad to make

00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,880
people click through your image alt tag

00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,710
is subheaders your h1 your first 100

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,200
words your image filename and then you

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,670
stop you don't have to use it any more

00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,320
than that ok your knees your synonyms

00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,940
now the next big thing that I think I'm

00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,350
gonna do a quick test line might go five

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,940
minutes over there's nothing you can do

00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,770
about it everyone's trapped in the room

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,980
I'm gonna keep talking you have to drag

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,390
me off does anyone have an iPhone I'm

00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,480
gonna try something embarrassing now

00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:26,440
okay you'll hear you and late can you

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,530
open up your phone and talk to Siri and

00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,570
can you say hey Siri who's the best

00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,780
you don't okay does anyone understand

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:37,690
how to use their iPhone anyone anyone

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,670
yeah okay can you ask Siri hey Siri

00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,670
who's the best copywriter in Sydney

00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:58,390
Commons if it's not me this is gonna be

00:43:52,570 --> 00:44:01,270
really embarrassing yeah it is me James

00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,460
it's Kate hoon that's me I hope James

00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:05,860
you really don't come to my

00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,540
presentations so these days more and

00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,460
more people are talking to devices

00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,930
hopefully just their phones and their

00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,270
Google homes and not their fridges in

00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,490
their vacuums but we get lonely it's all

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,320
understandable so we're talking twelve

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,960
art devices and that changes the way

00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,430
that we search because if we type we

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,950
tend to type things like best pizza

00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:27,280
restaurant Sydney where whereas if we

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,800
talk we ask questions yeah so Google

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,230
says that 70% of the requests to Google

00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,600
assistance are expressed in natural

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,000
language so we need to use that natural

00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,580
language in our posts if if the question

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,610
is what is this rash in my groin our

00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:45,040
blog title is what is this rash in your

00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,990
groin yeah because then the dots can be

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,400
connected so when were writing blog

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,810
posts we really want to be focusing on

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,800
the what the when the who's where the

00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:55,900
why the hell yeah how do I do this how

00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,289
do I speed up my website how do I be a

00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,199
better bookkeeper how do I write better

00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:03,150
copy whatever it may be these are the

00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,699
kinds of questions this is Google this

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,319
is Clive again the questions that people

00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:08,849
ask very search a conversation or

00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,650
they're generally first-person and they

00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:12,689
want to solve an immediate problem and

00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,640
if you can solve that problem you get

00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:17,279
the eat you get the expertise the

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,869
authority and the trust that is

00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:20,579
something I've typed in very many times

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:23,699
by the way I'm not going to tell you

00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,589
which one the next thing is you don't

00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,819
understand featured snippets so featured

00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,049
snippets look at something like this

00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:30,269
they come up at the top of the search

00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:32,339
results now we're seeing them more and

00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,689
more it can we can get different types

00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,829
of them but they are so basically

00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,989
Google's choice

00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:38,459
you only get them if you're the 30 on

00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:40,890
the first page but you can be in

00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:42,479
position 10 and still get our featured

00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,969
snippet which essentially means your

00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:47,069
position 0 above the ads above the local

00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:49,169
pack you're getting all the love all the

00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:51,359
click all the brand awareness so

00:45:49,169 --> 00:45:54,150
featured snippets are happening because

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,699
Google is becoming an answer engine yeah

00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,469
it's not a search engine anymore

00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:01,380
something like 10 percent of the search

00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:03,900
results now generate just results

00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,130
Google's skimming all our sites which I

00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,779
promised it would never do and

00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,209
publishing the content with our

00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:10,949
attribution thanks Google but we can't

00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:15,029
get out now we're all in we're never

00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:16,380
going to use that go give up on it so

00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:19,829
there's different types of featured

00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,049
snippets there are lists paragraphs of

00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:24,029
videos and then straightforward answers

00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:26,789
we're really going after the paragraphs

00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:28,829
yeah you want to be the person that when

00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:31,140
someone types in how much does a

00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:32,939
copywriter charge that you're the first

00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,099
result and you're gonna hope that the

00:46:32,939 --> 00:46:37,169
answer is good enough that they'll then

00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,089
click through but even if they don't

00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:41,339
it's still you've been judged by Google

00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:43,229
to be the expert and that goes in

00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:45,209
subliminally and people remember

00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:47,909
so featured snippet for you want to get

00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:50,459
a featured snippet right a 50-word short

00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,319
version of your blog post at the top and

00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:54,329
then go on to write a longer version

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,609
give Google the 50 words that they can

00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:59,789
cut them they can steal from you give it

00:46:56,609 --> 00:47:00,529
to them in a nice format finally and

00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:05,059
we're nearly there

00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:09,419
promise you don't have the secret sauce

00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:11,569
now I teach SEO and I would love to say

00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:13,670
that on my course I teach some magic

00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:16,369
trick that no one else in this room

00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,660
knows I don't course is it generally

00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:19,910
just someone else has gone to the effort

00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,739
of gathering all the information working

00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,059
out what's priority and breaking it down

00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,880
for you in a way that you can understand

00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:27,829
there is no secret source you can be a

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,930
great writer you can be a funny writer

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:32,479
you can give the best most intelligent

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:35,209
article in the world and it still won't

00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:37,249
perform and so sometimes it does feel a

00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:39,109
bit frustrating but sometimes you hit

00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:40,759
gold and generally I find you hit gold

00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,680
when you do follow all this stuff you

00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:45,019
really understand your customers you

00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,579
have some personality tone of voice you

00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:48,589
