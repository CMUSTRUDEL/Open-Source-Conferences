[Applause]

00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:10,019
well thank you very much for having me

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:12,920
so wordpress.org and wordpress comm

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,900
who's who's got a wordpress.org

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,770
installation that they use them who's

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,750
got a wordpress.com website excellent so

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,550
and that's when the common questions I

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,789
get asked by people as you know what's

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,300
the difference between wordpress.org and

00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:31,949
wordpress.com and and really simply as

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,260
we all know where Chris talk waters org

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,890
is the one that you download and host

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,890
and wordpress.com is the exact same

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,070
version of a software that is hosted and

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,730
managed by by automatic or by WordPress

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,539
so but there are some things that you

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,850
can use from wordpress.com to really

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,969
supercharge your wordpress.org website

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,309
so I just want to show you today it's

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,879
going to be a bit of a live demo so what

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:08,970
could go wrong right so so let's get

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:12,119
into it all right so so the first thing

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,430
is is that if you've got a wordpress.org

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,060
site you should have a wordpress.com

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:24,540
site as well so make sure you create a

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,850
wordpress.com account and and then what

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,130
happens is that there's a plug-in there

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,780
which is called jetpack who's got

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,150
jetpack installed on their website

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,009
already who's never heard of jetpack

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,530
excellent well this is it you're in for

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,540
a treat jetpack is is one of the plugins

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,860
that is a is a wordpress plugin and it

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,500
really does give a whole lot of

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,360
information to your website that you

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,680
know you may not be aware of and there's

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,570
there's a whole lot more features in

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
there and the more that you dig into it

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,159
the more that you can find that it does

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,450
so the first thing we'll do is just

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:04,380
install the jetpack plugin and to do

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,509
that it's just play this year I made a

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,349
quick video because I knew that if I

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,530
went alive wasn't going to work so all

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,930
we do is say just the normal way Acadia

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,459
begins in your site there and you'll see

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,800
that Hello Dolly is already there and

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,740
Akismet Saul also there is role too so

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,209
there WordPress plugins so we're going

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,790
to upload we'll go to the plug-in

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,130
repository and search for jetpack by

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,770
wordpress.com which is already on the

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,870
first page of the repository we'll

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,080
install it and then we'll activate it

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,330
and then once it's activated it gives

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,140
you access to a whole lot more features

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,570
that are available through wordpress.com

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,550
so first thing you do is click the set

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,690
up jetpack button down the bottom and

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,250
that will take you through to the

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,650
wordpress.com your wordpress.com asset

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,890
account to connect it and this is what

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,450
it looks like so you if you haven't got

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,790
an account already but with

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,160
wordpress.com you can create one here

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,950
and so just put your email address and

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,590
create a username choose a password and

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,230
then once you hit create your account

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,030
that actually creates your wordpress.com

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,370
account even though using the jetpack

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,530
plugin it creates it if you've already

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,450
got an account already then you can just

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:29,880
sign in with your username and add your

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,829
password I can't spell can't on and be

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,840
pass right in and once that happens

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,900
you'll come to a screen which will say

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,510
do you want to approve connecting your

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,040
wordpress.org site to your wordpress.com

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,670
login so it just click yes for that and

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,070
it takes a few seconds to activate and

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,140
connect at all and once it's done that

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,570
all of a sudden you've got some magic

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,430
superpowers for your website and it's

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,350
all pretty cool they do ask you some

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,170
questions now this is recently yet new

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,239
about you know what your websites for

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,410
I've just done the so many times I'm

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,310
just going to skip through them all but

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,220
you can answer those questions there and

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,040
when we get to the end of it but then

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,049
you've got some options there as to you

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,359
know what level you want to pay for my

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,880
recommendation is to scroll down to the

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,010
bottom and in the bottom you can just

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,479
start with free so just start with free

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,669
so all of the things I'm going to talk

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,930
to you about today all of the free

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,380
things are available

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,820
on wordpress.com for your site so once

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,150
you've done that this is now your

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,949
wordpress.com dashboard and this is

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,060
where some of the magic happens

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,970
so if you return to a WP admin down the

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,800
bottom it takes you back to your website

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,900
but first of all let's go and activate a

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,650
few things here so you'll see there's

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,350
some options that come with it so we're

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,930
going to try downtime monitoring so if

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,669
your website goes down then this will

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,850
send you through a notification to say

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:01,770
yeah your website's down so it's just as

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,240
simple as clicking the toggle and that's

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,310
all all activated and you'll get

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,340
notifications joining is your

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,160
wordpress.com sign-in to sign in to your

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,110
website so this will allow you to to use

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,449
either the login that you've got for

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,680
your website or for WordPress calm so

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,680
we're going to say yes we're going to do

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,009
that habit speeding up your site speeds

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,380
all important today with Google so let's

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,740
just enable the site accelerator which

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,289
will speed up our image load time and

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:36,180
some of our scripts so it's a CDN that's

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:38,220
provided by Photon on WordPress and can

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,990
also lazy load your images which means

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,240
that all of the images that are below

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,070
the fold they won't actually load into

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,210
your website until you scroll down to

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,669
them so it gives you a quick at load

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,849
time so all of these are available on

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:53,880
Jetpack comm and as you see it's taken

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,260
about a minute just to activate all of

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,360
these features here that are going to

00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,460
speed up your website and give you

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,729
easier accessibility to it so we're

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,789
going to click return WP admin so we're

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:09,500
back in our dashboard now and so back in

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:12,659
the dashboard we've got a Settings

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,229
section here and in the settings we've

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:18,690
got along the top security performance

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:20,220
writing sharing discussion and traffic

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,570
so there's a whole lot of options in

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,639
there that you can get in and have a

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,490
look at so what we'll do is we'll just

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,340
exit this and we'll go to a website that

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:33,090
I've created especially for this word

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,279
camp so soon when we get to the website

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,510
here's your normal login screen except

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,330
it's a little bit different there's no

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,000
user name

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,430
Astrid and we can if we click login with

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,610
username and password we can use that to

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:50,439
log in the normal way to our one to our

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:52,300
site or you can just click in login with

00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,930
WordPress comm it's a one click login

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,069
and in this case I'm not logged into

00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,530
where so you need to be logged into

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:03,159
WordPress comm to start with so let's

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:12,159
just log in to that anyone remember my

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:14,729
password password observation alright

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,729
let's try that again

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,150
and this is going to work this time

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,060
fingers crossed live demo remember it's

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,680
never going to work alright so it's

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,500
asking me to setup two-factor

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,500
authentication which we won't do

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:45,550
probably because I forgot a plug-in

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,009
installed that tells me to do that ok

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,629
because it because it's a live demo it's

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,430
not going to work so I'm just gonna log

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,430
in with my normal username and password

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:10,300
just pretend it worked so the key to it

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,100
is is you need to be already logged into

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,270
your WordPress comm account you're

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,500
already logged into it and you just

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,090
click that and click that you log on

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,740
with WordPress comm it'll just take you

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,740
straight through to the to the dashboard

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:29,380
it's at the top yeah and because it's a

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,169
demo I've just logged in with a

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,919
subscriber profile so it's just login

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,919
with another one

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:02,170
all right so let's get back to our

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:04,390
jetpack settings and here's where all of

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,260
the the magic is so the first thing is

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,140
security

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,310
now we've already done that in the

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:14,470
wordpress.com our dashboard already so

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,440
you'll see all of those icons there Tex

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,740
I've got brute force protection on we've

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,130
got allowing to login with wordpress.com

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,900
so we can use our email address and

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,930
there's some options here about how you

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,580
log on so it's got two-factor

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,950
authentication which is what it asked me

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,390
to start with so if I if I don't want to

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,650
set that up and we can turn it off and

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,140
then it won't ask me that question

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,760
my recommendation is these days it's I'm

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,210
having two-factor authentication

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,760
there's another layer of security which

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:51,880
makes it harder for people to hack into

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,720
your website so generally have it on the

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,970
the next one here is performance so

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,570
again we've already enabled the site

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,080
accelerator for our images and Static or

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,090
files such as CSS farms so sovietic all

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,730
those that will just make your website

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,620
run faster and enabling lazy load for

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,830
images now sometimes this doesn't work

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,810
with some page builders with a very lazy

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,430
load so if it's not working or you've

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,740
already got lazy load in with another

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,740
plugin then just switch it off here and

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:32,290
the next one is writing so there's a

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,560
couple of cool features that if you're

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,060
putting a gallery into your posts

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,530
you know how WordPress will just put

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,820
them in and they're just thumb now

00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:45,340
squares if you select display images in

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,810
a full screen gallery it'll enable you

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,670
to click on those images and when you

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,310
click on them it'll bring up a a

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,640
lightbox and you'll have full size of

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,880
images to screen that to to flow through

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,930
so it's just a quick way to get a good

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,560
presentation of your images and the

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,560
other one is

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,620
this one here when you're composing so

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,270
you can select this one here to copy if

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,220
you want to go a copier post or a page

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,870
there's some plugins that will do it or

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,720
if you just select that's here it will

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,800
and when you select copy it will copy

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,840
the entire post or page so so if you've

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,400
got a sub template layout that you using

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,160
it'll copy it all and then you can just

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,240
change it and alter us and and then so

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,030
publish your new new post you can write

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,090
pages or post in what they call the

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,670
plain text markdown the syntax you won't

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,650
know what that means there's a little

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,840
button over here that says learn more so

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,030
if you want to know what that means

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,310
markdown will serve enable you to do

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:54,420
things like I think they've got an

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:57,030
example here so if you use a what we've

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,610
got over here just a little star it will

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,900
turn it into a bullet point so there's

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,120
some so if you want to find out more

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,510
about markdown it's just a really quick

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,910
way of adding our bold italics bullet

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,450
points just by typing in in this

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,460
instance here the star so if you like

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:22,740
something so quick that's it's a good

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:30,870
easy way to do it and if we get back to

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:32,240
the side okay the latex who uses latex

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,050
on their web site

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,700
who wears latex where they're blogging

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,520
so latex is a markup language for

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,170
mathematical symbols if you so if you've

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,090
got mathematical equations that you want

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,100
to put in if you switch on latex it'll

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,790
do the equals in the Sigma sign and all

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,890
of those those tricky science without

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,900
turning it into code and some running

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:59,940
the code it'll just put it in this text

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:02,940
so good if you're a math teacher and you

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,490
can compose using short codes to embed

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,110
media from popular sites you actually

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,790
don't need that one on anymore because

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,790
with the latest versions of WordPress

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,130
you can just grab the say YouTube URL

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,930
just paste it into your post and it will

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,010
automatically know that it's a video and

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,340
displayed as a

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,870
so that one you don't need and then

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,460
you've got some things called custom

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,950
post types like and they offer you two

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,560
testimonials and portfolios so soon as

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,910
you activate those you'll see on the

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,390
left-hand side

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,730
you've now got testimonials and if we

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,850
activate in portfolios then it gives you

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,680
a portfolio custom post type so you

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,200
don't need to install another plugin and

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,150
create a whole custom post type it's all

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,770
here for you

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,779
so we go to testimonials for instance

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,760
you can see that we've already created

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:57,060
some testimonials that looks very much

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,190
like creating a post or a page and you

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,520
just you can use the guttenberg blocks

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:13,710
and you can just add your rum your text

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:15,180
and your images in there and the same

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,820
with portfolio so if you want you can

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,760
display your work or even have an image

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,550
gallery in there you can put all of your

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,180
portfolio pieces into a custom post type

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,850
which is there so how quick Sam

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,760
then we've got infinite scroll now if

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,220
using an infinite scroll allows you to

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,960
add a button to add a button to the

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,870
bottom of your post if you click on the

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,370
button it'll just scroll to the next

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,170
post so rather than going to the next

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,780
page it just automatically adds it to

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,100
the bottom of the post

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,050
but that one there requires sometimes

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,790
depending on your theme some themes have

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,710
support for that other themes don't have

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,839
support for it so if you click that and

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,160
you don't notice any difference then

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,600
your theme doesn't have support for it

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,020
you're going to add a line of code into

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,310
your run into your theme and if you want

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,370
to find out more about it there's a

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,220
little information box on the right hand

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,020
side if you just click learn more

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,880
that'll tell you what line of code you

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,350
need to add to your functions file and

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,350
how to get it working

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,330
and you've got another panel here which

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,310
is to enhance or add your additional CSS

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,890
again you don't need that one now

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:36,610
because that already comes pre-loaded in

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,560
in the new version of WordPress now this

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,620
one's really cool

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,690
within that your widgets so it'll allow

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,839
extra widgets for your site things like

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,029
I think Twitter social media so some

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,850
additional widgets available but what's

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,400
really good about this is a one that's

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,220
called enable widget visibility controls

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,540
to display or hide widgets on a

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,850
particular post so all you do is

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,620
activate that and then if you go over to

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:09,960
your to your widgets you'll see that

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,960
there's a new checkbox on your widgets

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:19,690
let's just grab one here and we'll drop

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,490
it into the footer you'll see there's

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,440
another button now it says visibility

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:31,630
when you click on that button something

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:43,510
should happen let's just reload that

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:47,380
page okay so when you click on a box

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,480
appears and it says either show or hide

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,690
this widget

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,390
for either a particular author for a

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,940
category for a user for a role so you

00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,230
might just show up for just admin or you

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,420
might want to show it just for

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:05,620
subscribers or or maybe some admin and

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:09,179
editor and then you can by pay it by tag

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:13,260
date or taxonomy so let's click page and

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:16,480
let's say we only want to show us on

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,429
posters so you can show that widget only

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,319
on posts so now it now it only shows in

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,699
your blog posts but it doesn't show on

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:30,040
the risk the pages in your website or

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:32,400
you can decide to display it just on one

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,560
particular page so down

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,720
aesthetic pages your pages there's only

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,060
four on this website here so also we

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,130
only want to show this box here itself

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,410
as a call to action box we only want

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,090
this to display on that one page soul

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,150
only display on the front on that one

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:53,600
page and no other pages how your serves

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:58,470
that yeah who knew jetpack could do that

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,450
so that that's that was the primary

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,270
feature that I understood jetpack four

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,680
was the head alone but I discovered all

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,290
these other cool things along the way as

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,960
well too so let's get back to the

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,260
jetpack settings the other thing you can

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,840
do is if you're at a word camp like this

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,100
and someone's talking you think geez

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,530
that'd make a good blog post you can

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,660
pull out your phone and you can create a

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,390
blog post by scene and sending an email

00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,830
to your website and it will do that so

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,200
here you can create a website address

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,910
that you can save into your phone or

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,920
into some other application and you can

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,990
create an email send that to your

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,630
website and it will create a draft post

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:44,790
right in your in your post on your

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,640
website and this one here in a the

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,580
WordPress comm toolbar you have a look

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,440
up the top here you can see that this

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,090
here's your wordpress.com website if you

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,570
tick on my site so that'll take you

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,160
through to the wordpress.com dashboard

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,290
which will show you what you can do a

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,810
whole lot more things turn it off you

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,370
just get your normal toolbar appearing

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,280
back up the top again that you'll be for

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,290
menu earth so if you're if you're

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,180
managing more like imagining a single

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,970
site you may not turn that on but if

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,760
you're managing multiple sites then this

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:21,030
is a good way to toggle back to your

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:26,550
wordpress comm and manage a whole lot of

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:28,860
sites from from from there so some

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,170
features here for sharing so when you

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,050
take on automatically share your posts

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,480
to your social networks you can share to

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,530
when you publish a post that will

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,800
automatically share it to Facebook

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,670
Twitter Linkedin and what do you need to

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,260
do is to

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,580
configure the accounts and once you've

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,490
done that and once you've turned it on

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,190
so here for instance let's say we want

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,990
to connect it to Facebook you just

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,370
simply connect the Facebook connect

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,650
button it will take you through to

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,650
Facebook and you log into our Facebook

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,480
and and authorize it and I can't

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:10,860
remember my Facebook password so I won't

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:14,100
do that so and it won't and it will tell

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,950
you so if you've got a Facebook feed or

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,800
a Facebook page you can select which of

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:25,020
those or all of them that are published

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:27,360
as those posts on for you and you can

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,100
you can even connect Google photos so

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,320
for google photos if you're storing your

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,790
photos in google photos and you want

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,710
them to be available in your media

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,300
library you connect to Google photos

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,400
then all of your photos stored in there

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,540
will be available to you in your media

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,310
library you don't actually have to uh

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,890
pre upload them again every time you

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:47,710
want to use them and MailChimp is wrong

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,789
these are some of my photos

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,789
[Music]

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,379
and you can add sharing buttons to the

00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:06,590
bottom of your website so on the bottom

00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:11,019
of your posts so with your sharing icons

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:14,960
you've got a choice of Facebook Twitter

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:17,179
Linkedin and a whole lot more so great

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,539
and you can choose with your displace of

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:22,090
icon icon and text so if you your toggle

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:25,580
through that there and just have a look

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:31,789
above here it's where you click changes

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:34,789
then nothing really changed where that

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,169
didn't so but you can you can choose

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,269
which buttons you want to have at the

00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,009
bottom of your website so here we go

00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,889
we've got Facebook and Twitter there

00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,739
let's say we want LinkedIn as well and

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:47,720
we can add that to the to the site so

00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,879
this one's this one's into the little

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,379
more tab so on the more tab you might

00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:53,840
just want to display say Twitter and

00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:56,809
Facebook and then have a more link and

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,460
then you can add all the other ones into

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:04,940
the more link or you can add them in

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:06,950
separately and here down here is is

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,359
where you can show where those buttons

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,759
display you might want them just on

00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,220
posts which is probably where you have

00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,950
them or on posts and pages if you've got

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,539
custom post types these are also display

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:23,239
there and you can choose to have them on

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:24,590
custom post types too so you don't need

00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:30,529
another plug-in to do it you can just

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:33,320
use jetpack and next tab is discussion

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:36,080
so you know the comments box that sits

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,359
at the bottom of your blog posts so you

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,009
can have people comment on that or you

00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:44,929
can let them log in with weird calm and

00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:47,809
so then your comments will appear on

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,259
WordPress comm as well as appearing on

00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:54,799
your on your blog and it just just

00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:58,370
enables it to go more a little more

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:02,690
wider than your than your own blog

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:05,419
then your own blog and which means that

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,620
in terms of your link building you've

00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:12,679
got another link back to your website

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:16,460
and you can let visitors subscribe to

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:20,000
your posts and comments by email so what

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,730
that means is they can just tick a check

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,830
box at the bottom of the of the comments

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,309
or at the bottom of your blog post every

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,700
time someone leaves a comment which is

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,929
the second one here they'll be notified

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,190
every time someone leaves a comment so

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,750
for instance if they've left a comment

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,909
on there and I want to follow a thread

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,370
through if someone replies the comment

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,990
or adds adds another comment to it then

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,000
they'll get an email notification every

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,529
time so good for activity on your blog

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,080
and keeping it active and keeping a

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:52,399
keepin discussion going well look at

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,559
this you can even view your email

00:23:52,399 --> 00:24:00,020
followers and I've got no one because I

00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:02,960
only set the site up two weeks ago so

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,850
but all of your subscribers would appear

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,669
here every time someone subscribes this

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:12,320
is this is where they'll appear and I

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:14,059
think we're almost at the end of all the

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,820
settings there's one more to go and

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:20,450
that's your traffic and this one's a

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:23,120
really good one as well too so related

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,390
posts you can add at the bottom of your

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,270
blog posts you can create a section like

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,440
this one here at the bottom of your blog

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,690
post so once people have finished

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,789
reading then they can find other

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,700
relevant blog posts that are like that

00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:40,220
and this would just automatically

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,020
generate you know relevant ones based on

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,330
your categories and tags so you can't

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,120
set which ones they are it's just an

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,340
algorithm that will choose that you know

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,169
three that are most relevant so

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,539
hopefully that keeps you people on your

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:59,690
site longer because they'll keep reading

00:24:55,539 --> 00:25:02,419
you can if you haven't got any SEO

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,539
plugins in there you can generate an

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:07,130
Excel XML sitemap which is what Google

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,710
needs for

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,350
webmaster tools or search console so all

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,409
you need to do is click switch it on now

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,090
you've got XML sitemaps and if you want

00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:19,309
to see what it looks like just click on

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,049
these links here and you'll be able to

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,049
to see your your sitemap

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,500
you can also verify so you know how

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,360
Google wants to verify your ownership of

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,940
the website before you can add things

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,620
like Google Analytics and and Google

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,870
code you can actually just put your

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,120
verification codes in here so you can

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,379
either click Google to take it through

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,990
the Google login and get your

00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:47,299
verification or you can do it do it

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,440
manually so that's all in the in the

00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,330
dashboard here you don't need to install

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,139
another plugin or you don't have to go

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:56,210
through to your files via PHP to then

00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:57,440
insert a file there to do the

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:03,529
verification you can do it right from

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:06,350
the dashboard with jetpack and this

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:07,850
one's good too so if you've got if

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:16,909
you've got a blog post of whether you I

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:19,309
roll this if it's that long you can just

00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,259
by switching on generate shortened URLs

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,450
for simple sharing you can get a URL

00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,100
that's that long that which will go over

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,750
the page so I don't need to use bitly or

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,789
some of those other shortening links

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,620
you've got that right in your right in

00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:33,590
your website just by switching on this

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:39,580
generated shortened URLs for simply

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:44,240
sharing a lot of features isn't it yeah

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,649
so that's that's just jetpack so have a

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,029
play have a look there are some more

00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:49,399
features in it but those are the key

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:51,230
ones that are in jetpack here's some

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:55,929
other things you can do with WordPress

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,929
calm as well so we go back to the slides

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:06,769
Akismet who gets BAM so Akismet is

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,320
WordPress is plugin for preventing spam

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:12,679
so you'll see if you go down to your

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,659
into your plugins here Akismet is

00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,769
automatically there all you do is just

00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:19,830
activate it so it's there with every

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:21,900
install

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,670
once you've activated you've got a

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:29,250
button that says set up your Akismet

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:31,920
account and what you simply do is

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,990
connect with jetpack so once you've got

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:41,190
jetpack installed you can install your

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:41,610
spam security weather kismet and you're

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,490
done

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:47,760
how easy is that now you're protected

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:50,040
let's just save it well the one thing I

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,070
do is I generally you've got an option

00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,950
here of silently discarding the worst

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,450
and most pervasive spam or you if you

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,460
really want to see what spammers are

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,930
saying just put in another folder so you

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,930
can read it we and when you've got time

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:16,050
so these years your Akismet and what

00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,790
else have we gotten ah Gravatar so you

00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:22,620
know sometimes you've got to upload a

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:24,480
