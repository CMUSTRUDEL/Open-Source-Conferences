thank you everyone hear me okay up the

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:14,460
back yep cool okay hands up here whoo

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,960
organs are runs their own business good

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,090
you're in the right place okay and these

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,460
slides are the opposite of Tony's I put

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,140
a lot of information in my slides I'm so

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,269
sorry about that but all the links will

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,119
be available and when you the guys push

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,669
them up to the website what I've tried

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,950
to do is take my 2d master main course

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,989
and shrink it down into 30 minutes so

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,940
I'm going to talk quite fast and go

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,110
through quite a lot of slides but just

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,579
bear in mind all the information is in

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,860
there and all the links are in there you

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,680
can look at that later on and we'll try

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,570
and do questions at the end and so let's

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,649
get straight into it and we're all in it

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,140
for the money I forgot your own

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,579
businesses and we want to make money I

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,079
want to have a good life going to be

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,270
able to be the good dad the good mom

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,649
spend some time quality time with that

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,930
as well

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,420
it's been able to get money and well we

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,010
need customers yep and where did we get

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,530
customers from they don't just fall from

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,020
the sky and so we need to get leads and

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,479
so this first part this is just but how

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,700
how do we get those leads coming in so

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,850
we can generate into to customers and

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,400
clients so what I see when I work with

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,790
businesses and services is time and time

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,979
again I see the same thing on the

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,259
website and that is M that just telling

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,360
everyone what they do and what services

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,130
they offer so if there are service based

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,380
you'll look at some news website so we

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,470
do web design we do graphic design we do

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,090
content marketing and for products and

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,950
something here's a product we do is a

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,899
beauty product here's our shoes and

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,090
that's great we need things to sell

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,380
because he thinks to sell to people to

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,110
make money because that's where it's all

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,780
about and that's great there are people

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,259
out there who are buying right now from

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,909
you and that's fantastic however the

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,759
market size for the people who are

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,360
buying from you right now is very very

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,250
very small okay

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,840
so here's a question to ask yourself

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,900
when was the last time you bought

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,730
something for absolutely no reason at

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,380
all I'm sure something has than that but

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,180
it's generally when people buy stuff

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,430
they're buying things because they they

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,070
have a problem need to solve right now

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,720
or in the foreseeable future when

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,220
they're buying something what they're

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,250
doing is they're moving themselves from

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,170
one state to another from being unhappy

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,090
to being happy if you buy an umbrella

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:41,220
you're moving yourself from being wet to

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,870
dry so if there's one key point from

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,570
this whole talk that like you guys to

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,150
take away is that people engage your

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,700
business at different levels of problem

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,920
awareness so you can't really sell to

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,470
everyone and expect them to be in I need

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,480
this right now I'm in binary mode right

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,500
now well you can but you're not gonna

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,200
make serious money doing that so has

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,520
this ever happened to you

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,080
you're on LinkedIn here connection

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,620
requests you have a look at the person

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,600
like yep that's fine I'd like to expand

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,090
my my LinkedIn Network and quite happy

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,510
I'll accept you and then an hour later a

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,850
day later we provide development content

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,620
marketing web services blah blah blah

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:31,320
hires now bye bye bye money money money

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,810
that is just the wrong conversation for

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,290
you to have at that particular time it's

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,030
like hi I'm will nice to me you wanna

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,470
get married

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,970
boom it's just through the wrong with

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm not environment at that particular

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,970
time okay so let's have a look at the

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,350
entire audience overview imagine them

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,239
like a pyramid so the top 3% of your

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,880
potential clients are in binary mode

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,590
they knows a problem they know there's a

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,300
solution out there you know that you

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,760
provide the solution and it looks quite

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,350
attractive so the other they're really

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,269
I'm gonna buy from you there's a 17% or

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,310
an information-gathering mode they know

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,600
there's problem out there and they know

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,790
that there's solutions there and they're

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,570
looking for what solution they want to

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,930
buy under that is 20% and their problem

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,150
aware but they're not really too

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,460
sure what solutions are out there and

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,050
they just started the search in that and

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,150
at the bottom of the pyramid is a

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,410
whopping six percent of people who are

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,199
clueless they don't even know they have

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,710
a problem all right so the goal is to

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,039
move that ninety seven percent up to the

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,620
three percent at the top of the triangle

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,120
so how'd you go about doing that well

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,370
that's a problem first it's what I see

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,039
for businesses and it's what I call the

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,930
only the top three percent problem now

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,190
these top three percent are great and

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,360
that's and that's where you're going to

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,490
make a lot of money from because they

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,310
are ready to purchase your stuff right

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,680
now the problem is that all your

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,780
competitors are also after that three

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,199
percent because it's easy right there in

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,699
bimal's they're going to buy stuff what

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,830
that means is that that three percent

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,930
has been stretched across all your

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,000
competition so you're going to make some

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:18,520
money but you're not going to make great

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,960
money does that make sense now Cyndi's

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,880
mastermind courses I get asked a lot

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,889
about me she should you do an issue

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,250
you're not doing it and people get very

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,919
hung up on this personally I don't think

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,900
meeting ish and I'll tell you why in the

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
next couple of slides and but if you do

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,889
want a niche and some people find

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,710
important and we do a little workshop

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,360
with people here's five stages five

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,030
steps that you can do your try and

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,940
define your niche the first step is you

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,830
basically create two circles one is your

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,440
passion things that you really really

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,460
like doing and other one is the skills

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,979
the things that you're really really

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,419
good at sometimes they don't always work

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,259
together but you should find it

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,110
something in the middle

00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,509
in here where you do that and you like

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,130
to do and that should be give you some

00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,919
definitions for it maybe particular

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,110
niches that you want to try and research

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,400
the second part you want to do is to see

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,840
if there's an actual market there to

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,389
sell to there's no point in just

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,740
plucking something if there's no market

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:17,110
so you can do that in Google Keyword

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,820
planner and it's a tool that you can use

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,770
and it tells you how many people are

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,770
searching for particular keywords and

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,690
long key tail and phrases so go and have

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,550
a look at the the areas you've

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,260
identified between those circles and

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,669
goose go and have a look and see if

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,270
their people actually searching for

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,289
those terms

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,210
what you'll tend to find is if there's

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:39,000
no searches then either one you've hit

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,380
the gold bank which is great or secondly

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,180
there's just no market out there so it's

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,210
kind of pointless going after putting

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,620
your effort into that conversely you

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,500
could find that you get millions of

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,650
search results back so if you're finding

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,000
either of those places then you probably

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,160
need to have look at your niche and

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,960
maybe redefine that and make it smaller

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,090
or do that research and step one again

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,650
until you find a good market size that

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,580
you can really sell to so step four

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,960
obviously you need to sell some things

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,849
you need to find some problems in within

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,050
that niche to have a look at some of

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,360
those problems then you want to start

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,570
hitting all the social networks so

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,849
Instagram forums and Facebook pages and

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,250
groups and read it as well a lot of

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,690
people post and read it and you want to

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,099
be listening to what people are whining

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,780
about what problems do they have

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,620
see if you can then create a solution

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,539
around that and then sell that to them

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,970
step 5 once you've gone to to that links

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,330
is you need to have a look to see what

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,590
competitors are in the market and just a

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,930
simple way to do that it's a simple

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,550
Google search so do a Google search for

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,699
your keywords that you've put in the

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,680
keyword planner and your market and have

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,300
a look at the PPC ads that's a Google

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,659
paid ads that's the ones that appear at

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,580
the top if there's a load of those then

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,800
that's probably not a good market to go

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,330
after because it's already swamped these

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,159
people are paying good money a lot of

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,590
money you try and target that market

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,050
audience so you're really looking for a

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,580
good balance in between all that so it

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,560
can be quite difficult finding ition it

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,090
can be quite time-consuming but if you

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,590
want to do it then those are the five

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:15,090
basic steps that you can try so let's

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,909
look at where your potential clients are

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,849
let's imagine that pyramid again yes the

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,979
3% the top are in buy mode and but

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,659
there's real good money to be had in

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,440
that thirty seven percent of people who

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:30,300
are problem aware they're not quite in

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,750
by9 mode but let's look at pushing them

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,300
up the pyramid there is how a fantastic

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,279
opportunity for that 60 percent at the

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,680
bottom so bear that in mind and I

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,959
guarantee you that a lawyer competitors

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,270
will be completely ignoring them and the

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,430
reason is it's hard work

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,890
those up to the top in to buy modes but

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,580
it can be done and the rewards can be

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,860
huge

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,150
that's 60 percent of that market that

00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:00,570
you're going for so let's look at

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:03,630
targeting that 37% we're talking about

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,380
landing pages here okay what we want to

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,480
do is highlight problems and one problem

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,670
pair landing page and then have a look

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
at their source of pain points around

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,410
that particular problem you want to

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,750
highlight associate issues Ewan

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,190
described all the pain points I think of

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,640
course you want to say isolation your

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,860
solution that they can buy you want a

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,140
sure that you can solve those pain

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,330
points and and you want to address all

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,230
the objections for them buying as well

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,640
so let's look at an example so yep so

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,290
this is not required that's why I think

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,630
Anisha is not required because these are

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,520
like general general targets that you

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,630
can use for anyone and to create a

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,610
landing page to target a particular

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,470
market so you don't have to niche as

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,040
long as you can do these things and you

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,460
can target pretty much anyone so here's

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,230
an example embarassed off your yellow

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,870
and stained teeth I drink a lot of tea

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,220
my teeth are pretty yellow

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,500
this could be like a problem just

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,020
imagine this are you scared to smile in

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,240

friends been let down by other products

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,430
they're fairly common associated

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,740
problems with that mean more or hear you

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,220

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,900
some of the issues so being scared to

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,990
smile in public and now you're confident

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,600

big for people so include that in your

people who are trying to build trust to

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:33,770
bring these people back up that pyramid

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,090

super easy treatments last a month and

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,190
here's how we pay pay by paypal card

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,530
online or over the phone convenience in

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,510
ITP so you can imagine those landing

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,580
pages we're trying to encourage those

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,110
people that they can overcome their

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,210
issues their problems with our solution

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,760
so we can do pretty much the same for

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,200
the 60% in the huge market now these

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,180
problem these people don't know that is

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,590
a problem there so we have to step up a

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,630
little bit we can't just target them

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,700
with normal landing pages like the one

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,400
before need to actually tell them and

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,260
let them know make them aware that there

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,410
is a problem so that we can then push

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,830
them up using the previous landing pages

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,300
so we can do this with example articles

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,250
so did you know that one in three men in

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,310
their 20s have naturally current stained

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,050
teeth it's not true fact I just put it

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,550
on there and but can you see that

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,270
article is actually targeting people

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:39,100
it's targeting men in their 20s with an

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:41,470
article new breakthrough home treatment

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,370
Banshees dirty staying teeth for good

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,140
again it's just highlighting that

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,110
problem dirty stained teeth oh yeah that

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,910
could be me here's a good one research

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,830
shows and this is not just made up

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,180
research shows that a brighter smile

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:58,280
closes more business deals again it's

00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,600
targeting people in business it's

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,250
targeting people who don't know they've

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,170
got a problem but wouldn't you be a

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,630
little bit interesting how a brighter

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,100
smile could increase your business you

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,950
might be clicking on that to go through

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,350
an angle

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,130
okay that that keep initially I want to

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,070
close more deals

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,110
I'm just general ones and can say int it

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:20,790
be quite endure can't yellow stained

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:22,500
teeth beer and be removed so again these

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,780
are examples of how we take that bottom

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,610
half they don't understand they have a

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,560
problem and just try and make one

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,660
problem away as you can it engaging them

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,890
and try slowly to move them up that

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,740
pyramid so here's the general strategy

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,140
and very general to get leads I mean to

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,140
find a problem that exists that could be

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,640
an issue or not Enosh need to understand

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,160
all the related pain points or at least

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,320
enough pain points around there to build

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,450
for people to empathize and understand

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,550
yet that fits me in that situation I

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,290
understand that that's who I am

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,300
of course you have to have a solution

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,820
that fixes that problem that's what

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,250
we're trying to sell we to address the

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,720
pinpoints to assume that our solution

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:09,030
does solve all those pain points we just

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,980
redress objections to buying to commit

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,740
so it's easy it's affordable

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,210
do you trust me all that and and then

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,200
build your landing pages for those

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,310
particular problem over here types so I

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,680
don't want to go into landing page

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,780
design but I did your talk at the

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,280
WordPress meetup about that so it's a

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,050
link in the sliding go and watch the

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,580
video about an hour long and it goes

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,820
through the different design elements of

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:36,590
your landing pages and the copy positive

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,590
copy good images stuff like that

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,910
and just bear in mind video in your

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,160
landing pages there's these five basic

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,050
obstacles that you're trying to get over

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,270
and a general landing page so that's

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,250
nobody huh somebody has no need for it

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,650
that's just sixty percent you don't have

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,200
money or they don't have the price point

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,070
that you're offering it's not of urgency

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,990
to them the new desire in your solution

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,950
and under certainly got new trust

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,990
because they don't know who you are or

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,180
anything to back up so those are the

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:11,490
generally five points you want to try

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:13,050
and overcome in a landing page okay so

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,700
I've done all this work let's see if we

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,030
can try qualifying these leads on the

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,770
landing pages so when you're generating

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,390
a landing pages

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,150
trying to avoid these types of questions

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,610
on them so try to avoid open-ended

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:32,530
questions and has specific ones so

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:35,070
answer yes no numbers and one two three

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,660
and don't have open-ended questions

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,180
don't have hard questions so when you're

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,020
asking stuff on on landing pages it's

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,520
not an exam

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,290
don't make them think too hard we want

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,230
to make this really easy for people to

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,990
go through landing page and get to what

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,300
you wanted to do and don't bang them

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,640
with too many options you know are you

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,890
our social person are you not a source

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,520
of person do you network too much and

00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,650
blah blah blah

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,120
people go but just give them three

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,140
options one two three

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,370
make it nice and easy for them so here

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,180
are some good stuff that you can put on

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,130
landing pages use a personal story so

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,710
how can learning a new language help you

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,960
oh well Ingrid learned Spanish you know

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,580
one should be able to create a business

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,130
course for mine she's moved into this

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,990
new area she's living her life better

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,730
because she she had I learned a new

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,120
language from the service that we

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,400
provide

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,710
so get personal tell about how your

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,900
product your solution helped people and

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,700
make it hard to say no when you're on

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,170
the landing page so here's an example

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,570
we'd like to subscribe to this online

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,120
course for a one-time only eighty eight

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,220
percent discount close this page and you

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,380
lose this massive saving forever oh I

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,540
must by now define target audiences if

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,580
you have a social product in your cell

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,170
on a social solution you don't people

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,180
who are not in the social area to buy it

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,370
so qualify them are you new to social

00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,080
media so if you've got our package

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,100
that's targeting new people you want to

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,870
make sure that you getting the right

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,150
people on your landing pages so ask

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,860
those questions and use first person

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,230
questions as well because people can

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,970
empathize with those how can I overcome

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,130
my fear of public speaking

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,130
yep that's me people can really

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,140
empathize with first-person questions so

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,880
I go through quite a lot of the

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,770
psychology of this I got another blog

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,050
post on that this is a huge topic on

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:27,520
itself so you can read that after the

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:29,170
talk so in people you do landing pages

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,480
people are not just gonna give you all

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,920
the information okay and for nothing

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,150
so the idea

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,370
he is you're gonna have something to

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,720
offer them something in exchange to give

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,000
that for them to give you their

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,090
information we tend to call this a

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,060
high-value content offer and this is

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,000
generally for the 37% the people who are

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,460
problem aware and people who are looking

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,350
for the solution and what you want to do

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,670
is offer give them something that's

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,150
really really valuable not just a

00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:00,850
general ebook oral ago I say I document

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,400
some of them is real value to them so

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,800
here's an example of a client I worked

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,430
with in the early part of this year and

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,840
they had a videography service so we did

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:14,650
a landing page it was something similar

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,230
along this line download my entire elite

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,630
video production step process the one I

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,840
use on every professional video I'm

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:26,410
create honed over 5,000 professional

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,750
hours a document 5 how to videos nothing

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,430
left I become your own video agency I

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,880
mean that's really just throwing

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,470
everything at them Wow and that just it

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,390
was completely different to what the

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,060
competition we're doing competition were

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,380
we're selling a couple of videos and

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,870
they might have a little one-page

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,210
checklist on what to do these guys were

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:49,450
throwing the entire process out for free

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,640
okay now yes you'll get people will just

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,740
take and you won't get stuff back if I

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,960
guarantee you you're gonna build trust

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,440
you're gonna build engagement by giving

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,800
people or what you do people will see

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,890
value in that and they'll see value that

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,940
buying your time is beneficial for them

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,710
because they don't have to spend all

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,790
that time themselves the and I've seen

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,640
that well if you've done all this stuff

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,680
you're the expert yeah okay I'm happy to

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,130
buy your services then it really does

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,510
work

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:23,080
high-value content offer so here's what

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,180
we do in our landing pages we drive the

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,980
high-value content offer and I mean want

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,590
to book what I call an introduction

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,740
session I say 17 minute but just keep it

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,360
short in that introduction session we

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,790
want to find their specific pain points

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,330
and even want to tailor our solutions so

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,590
they bring them into bio mode when we're

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,720
doing these their sessions want to make

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,430
it quick so do your intros really really

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,400
quickly and I tend to save

00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,990
four minutes for the intros and get it

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,060
over and done with and then bang take

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,560
control of that session so in this

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,360
introduction session we're going to find

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,600
out little bit more about each other

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,220
let's begin and there's some essentials

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,110
that you need to cover when you're doing

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,480
these introduction sessions so you want

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,000
to look at target audiences and main

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,280
competitors you're gonna have a look at

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,800
budget and time frame you can they

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,620
afford your service and can you do it in

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,310
time why do you need this done that's

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,630
the biggest question you need to ask why

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,830
and what are the biggest pain points

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,210
right now okay what can you quickly sell

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,740
them that's going to make their life a

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,180
lot better and get them to tell you what

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,300
it's going to look like when you

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,730
delivered that service as well and very

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,470
importantly is what if you tried before

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,670
what's worked and what's filled you

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,120
don't want to do the same thing that's

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:42,550
not worked for them before now

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,610
introductions sessions are very

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,540
different from discovery sessions

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,700
introduction sessions are quick you

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,280
define the main pain points and push

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,380
them into bio mode generally discovery

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,330
sessions are a lot deeper people are

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,820
usually already in buy mode at the top

00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,560
of the pyramid and a lot longer they

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,230
last for two hours four hours or a

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,380
half-day and it's a really deep dive

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:10,390
into that business and again why do you

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:12,730
need this so some quick things want to

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,770
cover for a discovery session if you

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,690
want to do that and so again the same

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,580
essentials for introductory but you want

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,830
to do the deep dive you want to find out

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,900
things like customer lifetime value how

00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,150
much it cost for when they get elite and

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,890
the business goals and what's

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,140
underperforming the business areas and

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,970
you want to do why why cry cry cry all

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,380
the time so that's why discovery

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,150
sessions can last at least half a day

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,500
because you're asking these clients the

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,850
same question why do you want to do that

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,690
why is this makes sense where do you

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,000
want to go from here

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:43,860
so I gain more details in the blog post

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,870
there for you okay we are getting there

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:52,840
okay so ads so all this stuff before has

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:54,520
been like a jab just general general

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,750
people go into your site but what we

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,000
should do is targeting these landing

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,730
pages of ads as well so let's look at a

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,960
different type of

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,790
to drive people to your your websites

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,380
and when you use Google ads use Google

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,910
ads they obviously appear in searches

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,600
these people are already looking for

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,940
solutions

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,890
they're already problem aware so you use

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,290
Google ad to target their top three and

00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:19,670
the top 17% towards that into that by

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,770
would Facebook ads and are generally at

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,830
people on social networks are generally

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,110
not particularly a will is a problem and

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,950
so you can use those to really get that

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:33,310
60% and that 20% and push them up to the

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,780
pyramid as well

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:39,820
okay let's we've done all this hard work

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,920
let's have a look at proposing okay

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,230
surprising cost me is pricing versus

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,970
value-based pricing and cost based

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,140
pricing is the time it takes for you to

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,230
do your stuff

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,570
so example hourly rates so there's an

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:58,190
example of people start off with five

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,630
page website 65 hours charge 100s 750 or

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,100
for e-commerce you know it's a little

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,420
bit more it's going to be 40 hours

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,340
that's six thousand dollars

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,900
it doesn't really scale just so you get

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,300
a big client in it's got all that stuff

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,740
up there I it's gonna take you 200 hours

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,720
are you gonna charge in 30 thousands of

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,600
dollars you can do but if you're just

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,030
pumping out and an equation numbers then

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,470
they're not gonna see the ROI back in

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,510
that if you just say I'll gonna cost you

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,860
thirty thousand the client cannot see

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,260
the value in that and I'll just you

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,210
won't get anywhere in that and that's

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,490
why value-based pricing is the best

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,470
model so when we're doing value-based

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,110
pricing what we're basically doing is

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,150
the we're selling a service based on the

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,940
clients perception of their return of

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,710
investment is not your time it does

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,210
require a discovery session to be done

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,650
because you need to find out about their

00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,290
business in to find about their pain

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,510
points and their objections and the

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,460
customer lifetime value the target

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,020
audience need all this stuff to be able

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,640
to do value-based pricing to tell them

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,080
what they're going to get back in return

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,550
so why is it so much better whole it

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,110
delivers a solution the client actually

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,150
needs case you've done the discovery

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,770
session you know what they need net and

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,960
it has the best chance of making you

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,730
money over the cost based value the

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,040
client can perceive how much investment

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,440
cost and versus ROI

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,820
completely decouples your time against

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,090
what you're delivering in your solution

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,620
so let's look at it proposal essentials

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,850
so some things include after you done

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,500
the discovery session after you now

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,600
pitching mode you write up your proposal

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,920
you definitely want to include your

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,530
terms and conditions how you're working

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,480
with them and the requirements what's in

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,550
scope and what's out of school very

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,170
important what's out to scope the work

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,850
through how are you going to work with

00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,830
them the deliverables and milestones

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,470
what are you going to deliver what some

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,580
major things you're going to deliver

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,310
cost breakdown how much does each

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,990
component in that cost because that can

00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,090
then justify the end price if people are

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,460
looking to see all that because that

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,770
that because this that is why it costs

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,240
this much at the bottom the schedule

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,640
plane are you going to deliver all this

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,950
stuff and the total investment we call

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,710
in we call investment rather than cost

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,870
this cost is kind of money that you just

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:09,270
threw out whose investment is something

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,160
you're earning it's a total investment

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,830
that they're gonna pay and the payment

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,410
schedule get a signature

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,590
please don't rely on variable stuff okay

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,720
get that client to sign off so I've

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,520
included a link to the template that I

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,800
use the proposal template I use so

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,810
please download that have Luke plug in

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,150
your numbers we brand it but it will

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:33,380
give you a starter for 10 and covering

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,960
all those different essentials they're

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,660
getting paid those different ways are

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,520
getting paid and all up front is kind of

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:48,060
unusual more unusual is a deposit now

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,280
and some more later my terms are 50% now

00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,220
as a deposit and they affect two percent

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,830
on agreed deliverables but now notice I

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,990
said agreed deliverables and not project

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,340
ain't because if you working for larger

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,890
customers when you're delivering stuff

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,050
that project will roll on and on and on

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,330
so basically when you've done your stuff

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,160
when you've delivered it's like either

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,990
myself I've given it to you now give me

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,590
your money okay rather than project

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,210
completion some other ones up there 25%

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,030
deposit you can do on a month by month

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,130
or on a milestone basis totally up to

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,880
you but and generally deposit now and

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,560
more later tends to work have a clear

00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,690
payment timeframe

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,580
ask your clients when you before you

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,950
pitch them when is their payroll

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,020
there's no point saying all here's the

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,270
payment I expect in seven days if their

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,770
company is doing a payroll run every 28

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,960
days or the first of the month or last

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,500
month you know just ask them the simple

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,340
question

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,210
yeah voice embarassment please do issue

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,800
invoices I've worked with businesses who

00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,720
the clients have I've called them and

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,490
say Oh where's the invoice for this work

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,830
I don't embarrass yourself send out the

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,540
invoice make sure that's there if your

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,510
software has invoice your minders turn

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,490
it on everyone's busy sometimes people

00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,830
miss invoices I hadn't that reminder

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,360
that sayings I and it's great okay so

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,390
definitely turn that on if your software

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,070
supports that and again if after all

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,560
that you're still not getting paid

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,450
remember we sign the document the client

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,520
signed the document that's legal

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,680
contract so if you have got any issues

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,600
then you can set that legal process to

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,890
try and recoup your money that's why

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,660
it's so important to get your customers

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:29,130
to sign that document because it makes

00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:31,740
it legally binding and of course if they

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:35,730
want to give me cash that's fine we

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,830
accept cash so that's the end of my talk

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,420
it's it's a huge amount of stuff and

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,850
I've tried to elaborate a little bit

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,200
more with some blog posts that you can

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,330
read afterwards to try and get a little

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,710
bit more information

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,050
yeah but hopefully that's helped you a

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,120
little bit on your journey understanding

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,010
a little bit more about value-based

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,900
costing as opposed to just cost based

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,690
pricing and so definitely try and give

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,240
it a go try and engage your audiences

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,670
the different problem awareness and try

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,200
and drive them up and trying to do some

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,000
discovery sessions try and talk to your

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,220
clients and find out by all the

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,530
pinpoints and get them to tell you how

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,240
to write your proposal for them so

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,240
thanks very much you know asking

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,179
here we we have time for two questions

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,179
is anybody got some questions for will

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm conscious we've also got the the

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:40,160
live stream so we need the mic Oh glad

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,750
good to see you again mate yes I've had

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,480
some clients that have been very

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,919
resistant to value-based pricing that is

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,289
there are some people are they just seem

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,120
to be very determined to work out what

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,730
they think your labour costs are to do

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,440
something and then try and you know say

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,440
well I could do the same thing if I get

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,240
this development country workforce and

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,740
at the Momo's say well we know like I

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,789
don't you know that's not how we work

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,710
you know

00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:05,059
yeah we think we've had people who have

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,289
been disappointed in that and that's why

00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,630
they come to me but do you have any

00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:11,330
other tactics for dealing with people

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,669
who just don't want to pay based on

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,039
value rather than what they instead well

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,230
they think your costs are yeah I joined

00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,600
that's a great question I generally find

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,980
this for working with older clients so

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,820
people have been in business for a long

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,669
long time it's a difficult conversation

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,100
to have with them but essentially in in

00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:33,950
the proposal and I've got a template

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,200
link clear the components that you are

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,260
selling them for the solution are broken

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,690
down in a cost by cost factor so things

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,909
like and creating a website creating are

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,340
moving over to a development server

00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:48,470
testing on the development server test

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:51,169
against milestone one delivering

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:54,350
graphics doing content uploading media

00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:55,520
doing SEO during your first marketing

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,950
social media there are all different

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,289
components within that proposal and

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,210
they're all priced accordingly so even

00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:04,760
though at the end there's a huge number

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,799
that you're justifying as a value based

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,860
within that proposal we can see a

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,929
breakdown of those costs within them so

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,419
it's kind of the best of both worlds I

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:14,650
guess so you can try try doing it that

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,549
way

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,549
thank you thanks Pat

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,420
[Music]

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,220
okay we have another question I was just

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,900
looking at the exemple we had before

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:39,270
with the vo company where they their

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,950
idea was to give the process away for

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,050
free

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,760
I'm marketer as well and I totally

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,540
understand that but I think maybe if you

00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,970
could give some more clarity for us as

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,370
maybe word website WordPress developers

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,010
if we did our you know 100 point

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,470
checklist that we all go through to you

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,420
know get ready to launch a website that

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,100
is going to be super super valuable for

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,290
everyone in this room who's also a

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,020
wordpress developer but maybe not to the

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,570
ideal client so even though it might be

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,580
an authority piece of information that

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,860
you're kind of providing it may not be

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,380
you know information that they're

00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,990
willing to consume or able to consume so

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,380
is it another like example you could use

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,360
or you like I'm just wondering that

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,460
specific example because they're

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,270
obviously offering that video production

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,740
as a service that I feel like there's a

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:35,850
little bit of a mismatch between the

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,710
message and the target audience yeah so

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,000
this is all about defining the actual

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,010
target audience and you're right

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,010
so that high-value content offer that

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:47,010
was targeting that 37% of people who are

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,080
problem aware and it was a great deal

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,060
and the reason that we did that whole

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,370
inclusive stuff was because they had a

00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,400
huge amount of competition out there so

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,350
a lot their competition we're selling or

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,870
we're producing a lot of high value

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,430
content or what procedures high-value

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,950
content we needed to go a step further

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,810
okay so we're not trying to compete with

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,160
them on the same level you wanted to

00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,260
actually blow the socks off the

00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,600
competition so we went that one that one

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,740
step further to say you looked in the

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,500
same of your competition but we'll just

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,930
give you the whole works and yeah you're

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,850
right some people were just overblown

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,790
with that some people think of emails

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,800
back to say is this real I think I'm you

00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,000
getting access to your entire stuff and

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,070
all we need to give you is like our

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,080
email address we were like yeah yeah

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,870
that's totally true so it works

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,190
for majority of people and there are

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,950
some people that will come back

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm won't understand or won't perceive

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,059
the value of that but that's there's a

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,750
way that marketing works I mean you know

00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,279
that yourself

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,549
so it's all about targeting that

00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,990
high-value content for that specific I'm

00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,600
not going to say niche but that specific

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:54,330
kind of target audience that you want to

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,789
go for thanks for the question that's

00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,380

00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,909
