Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	Marthie will discuss with the audience the top reasons why it is so important to perform maintenance on your website. Whether you do it yourself and you pay someone to do it for you. This is one of the most neglected areas of a website, and just like a car, it requires regular maintenance otherwise it will break down and get viruses etc and cause your business to halt. Prevention has always been better than cure.
