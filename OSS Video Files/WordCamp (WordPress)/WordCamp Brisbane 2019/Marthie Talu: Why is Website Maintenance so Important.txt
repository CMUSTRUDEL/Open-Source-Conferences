Title: Marthie Talu: Why is Website Maintenance so Important
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	Marthie will discuss with the audience the top reasons why it is so important to perform maintenance on your website. Whether you do it yourself and you pay someone to do it for you. This is one of the most neglected areas of a website, and just like a car, it requires regular maintenance otherwise it will break down and get viruses etc and cause your business to halt. Prevention has always been better than cure.

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,840
so like the introducer said I started my

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,780
business now seven years ago it wasn't

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,870
updated with the goal to help businesses

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,670
with the marketing requirements my

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,149
background is in public relations and IT

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,579
and I do graphic design web development

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,789
and marketing I produce websites

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,949
brochures business cards anything you

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,379
might need to get your your name and

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,969
your business out there I have my own

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,359
networking group called the small

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,159
business creative we have a space on

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,280
Facebook or meetup and we get together

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,700
once a month just to share ideas to

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,080
collaborate and have a laugh and have a

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,600
bite to eat I also run workshops

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,360
teaching business owners about their

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,229
website and how they can use it to

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,950
leverage it from it I found that

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,119
business owners of willing to give they

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,090
their money away to any web developer

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,100
without understanding what's involved to

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,100
to have a website and how does it work

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:45,770
so who here has got a website so how

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,149
much did you pay for it and just

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,540
randomly how much did you pay for your

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,540
website

00:01:51,710 --> 00:02:01,500
okay anybody want to just tell fit yeah

00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:05,150
for so the average wave study size costs

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,150
between 3 and 20 grand

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,270
I had somebody telling me that they were

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,610
quoted 90,000 dollars for a website so

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,770
if you're going to spend that amount of

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,650
money don't you want to make sure that

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,170
you get the most out of a website the

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,590
average age of a website is about 2.7

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,350
years and before he becomes old and

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,470
redundant you need to make sure that

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,870
you're gonna get the best out of it and

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,690
the best way to do that is to maintain

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,380
it properly think of your website as an

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,440
employee do you want a slacker who slow

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,959
to start and get and breaks down at the

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,920
most inopportune moment or do you want

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,920
an employee who works for you 24/7 with

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,680
no cyclic helps you may pay the bills

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,459
and saves you money and time all you

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,530
need to do this is spin 5 spin as little

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,920
as 5 minutes a week to maintain your

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,920
website

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,910
they said that the best things in life

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,640
are free but they also say that to get

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,440
what you pay for so why do you think

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,240
it's important to maintain your website

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,250
I'm gonna ask the people with the marks

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,870

SEO is everyone so you all know why it's

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,760
important but I'll go through this to

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,440

website get some respect from Google

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,030
that's an important one

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:13,290
use the experience speed it helps with

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,930
it will fix unusable features broken

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,060
links and 404 errors and it will prevent

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,350
damage to your website's integrity and

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:27,230
damage to your brand so we will look at

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:30,120
these these important steps to you add a

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,450
little bit more but do you know that

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:38,250
only 23 percent of small business owners

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:43,260
update their sites each year so let's

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,910
start keeping your website site by doing

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,820
your maintenance you will protect your

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:52,110
website against viruses and potential

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,210
hacking icky spray are not suspecting

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,910
website owners knowing that they don't

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,850
update their sites regularly the one

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,310
this is one of the reasons WordPress and

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:06,210
plug-in developers update their software

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,820
they're continuously trying to to make

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,330
the product better for you so it doesn't

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,760
get hacked it's important to update all

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,860
your plugins your themes your

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,450
translations you will free software to

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,880
cover all your bases a good tip here is

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,850
to have if you have a lot of plugins to

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,040
update is update six at a time that way

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,020
you maybe you prevent the server falling

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,919
over and you have to wait before you can

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:41,230
go back in and fix the problem if I

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:46,740
think since is distich is that over 39

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,740
sorry a finding statistic

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,250
is that cyber attack occurs every 39

00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:00,710
seconds and WordPress is one of the most

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:03,290
targeted platforms in the world as

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:08,140
WordPress has over 60 percent market

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,140
share followed by Joomla with 3 percent

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,300
another frightening statistics from from

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,710
friendly friendly finds a friend finder

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,600
sites you know what's a friend finder

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,180
site so this is your social media

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:32,550
accounts so in 2017 402 312 million

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,490
users got hacked I recently had the

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,740
experience with Netflix anybody else

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,760
have a Netflix account I got hacked from

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,320
somebody in Croatia

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,250
and they went in and they go to the top

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,470
layer tier of the subscription and I got

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,419
an expectation from these flicks we

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,300
change supporters and I thought and they

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,370
and we thought it's all gone now two

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,380
weeks later I got my credit card

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,620
statement and he discovered I'm now

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,260
being charged 19 dollars every time

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,930
every month and I spoken to Netflix and

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,030
I said they're not gonna refund me the

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,479
money because it's between you and your

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:16,289
bank so they taken them out of the

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,510
equation so they are over a hundred and

00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:21,510
forty eight million Netflix subscribers

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,610
and add an average price of $15 per

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,490
subscription I think that they can make

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,970
security one of the the most important

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,970
factors

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,569
this is the cases that will change the

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:38,749
way the world works

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:41,060
consumers hate being hacked and the

00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:43,699
website owner has the responsibility to

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:51,110
ensure that they website a site for the

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:55,129
users to use next point to ensure the

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,460
smooth operation of your website these

00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:01,310
days is all about user experience in

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,029
fact Google will rank a site higher if

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,800
it has a much better user experience

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,529
slow videos or videos that's not working

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,069
at all could be related to an outsider

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:15,710
Flash Player nothing is more frustrating

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:18,560
to a user than looking for something on

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,949
a website and the links are not working

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,400
or the video takes forever to load it's

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:29,139
the fastest way to ensure that people

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,139
leave your site and never comes back

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,590
if you unsure about what I'm going

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,710
through please just stop me and ask a

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,710
question

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,050
so Google will show you some respect

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,550
Google wants to rank websites that has

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,590
the most relevant and up-to-date

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,730
information on their search engine

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,600
results page

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,790
they may even D index your website if it

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,010
hasn't been updated recently enough and

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,460
if they suspect that it might be

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,960
infected by malware you must keep your

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,560
website directly updated with current

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:16,400
content use keywords and articles in

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,860
order for it to rank well with Google so

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,300
you can expect to have better angles

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,580
when you can show that you care about

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,710
your website that the information gets

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:31,160
regularly updated and that there's no

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:34,250
broken links in outdated software like I

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,100
said before it's all about user

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:41,360
experience if you don't maintain your

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,100
website it will affect how a user will

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,380
experience your file just one bad

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,900
experience is enough for a user to click

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:52,730
away and they will more than likely

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:54,860
never return so how are user see your

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,900
website is important as it influences

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,880
the perception which can affect your

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,870
reputation your brand

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,660
your credibility as Steve Jobs said

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,430
start with the custom X experience and

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,410
then work your way back to the

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:16,550
technology is anybody here who has a bad

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:22,060
experience with a website are you ready

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,060
to go back to that website not lucky

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:31,480
so we all get to speed speed is one of

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,580
the key issues of a website websites

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,190
that have not been maintained gradually

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,350
gets slower over time to load and it has

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,110
to work as it has to works with all the

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,410
courage so if you have a look at the

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,160
stats 27 percent of consumers expect a

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,779
website to load in two seconds or less

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,660
40 percent will abandon the site if it

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:56,170
takes more than three seconds to load

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,450
and a one-second delay will decrease the

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,550
customer satisfaction by 16 percent so

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:05,170
that's pretty frightening to to think

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:08,350
about it website today are lean and mean

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,380
and there's no excess coding gone are

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,180
the days for big clunky starts plugins

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,670
in my and themes are stripped to the

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,529
bare minimum to ensure that they work

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:21,490
that the website loads in less than

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:23,710
three seconds what happens if you don't

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,310
updates your update your theme and

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,029
forever

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,970
it gets slower designers know this and

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,870
they will concentrate on getting their

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:38,860
themes are sleek and as fast as possible

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:43,300
every second counts but how long is a

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,760
second well I think that depends on who

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,589
you ask

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,190
as Benjamin Franklin years the same time

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:54,940
as money a one-second delay in a page

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:59,820
responsiveness can reduce conversion up

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:04,510
to 7% if you have an e-commerce site

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:08,260
making $100,000 a year a day one second

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:11,300
can lead to 2.5 million dollars so it

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,030
can cost you a lot

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,620
now we look at their unusable features

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,200
so if you don't maintain your website

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,210
and you don't do the updates the

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,840
features on your website will eventually

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,630
become unusable so pictures might cut

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:31,140
might not come up videos will stop

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,160
working like we said before plugins will

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:38,840
stop working as they become obsolete

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,100
then is 54,000 plugins so they are

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,380
continuously getting obsolete so

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,660
designers decided to work on new stuff

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,050
and they just don't support the old

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,530
plugins anymore so when you purchase

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,780
your website for 20k or 90k like

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,560
somebody does with all the bells and

00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:01,070
whistles they're in don't maintain it it

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
will eventually stop working altogether

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,720
you might see the warnings or you might

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,460
not if you maintain your website you

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,240
will know exactly which plugins are

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:14,280
working in which or not so now we're

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,350
going to look at the broken links and

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,940
404 errors so everybody know what's a

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,460
broken leg so basically what it is if

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,000
you click on it it just gives you for a

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,060
for saying the place doesn't work so one

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,960
of the most annoying things for your

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,330
website for your prospective customers

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,080
is a website with broken links imagine

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,390
the customer making a decision to buy

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:47,130
your product in after pressing the Buy

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,560
button only gets a 404 error customers

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,470
expect better and they will more likely

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,070
move to a website that's being looked

00:13:52,470 --> 00:14:00,480
after and cared for remember back in the

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,610
1990's when it was the coolest thing if

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,570
you can just get onto our webs on to the

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:09,690
Internet let alone having a website now

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,900
people has moved fastest and I expect a

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,100
whole new level of customer service

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,960
besides letting your customer down

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,070
broken links can

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,930
actually harm your SEO ranking Google

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,840
and other search engines continuously

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:30,000
crawl your site and if they came across

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:32,280
a broken link they will record it a next

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,620
time somebody search for that particular

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,880
product they will refer to a website

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,880
that's actually working

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,730
it's how we get to website integrity and

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,009
ban protection if you have updated

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,649
conning on your website what does it say

00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:58,410
to your customers will they come back

00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:02,879
once they know that you don't update the

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:05,100
information so don't risk your appetite

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,100
your reputation without their content

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,259
spelling and grammar errors keyword

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:16,050
stuffing you all know what's keyword

00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:18,209
stuffing keyword stuffing so basically

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,889
where you just put all your keywords in

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,420
one paragraph and hope everything goes

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,059
well

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,819
promising things you can deliver

00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:29,939
frustrated users with broken links and a

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:32,519
slow loading site or putting your user

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:36,149
information at risk and sites being

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,040
hacked support works tonight in the

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,420
digital connected will the bite of days

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,430
that get either boost or bite your brand

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,879
so be mindful when you do your website's

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,879
updates

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,250
so what does it entail how do you keep

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,790
your website the tip top set

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,820
check all the pages unloading without

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,270
errors so if you have to physically go

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,560
to all the pages on your website do it

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,120
it will just give you that peace of mind

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,570
and everything is working

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,120
make sure your backup is working the

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,750
golden rules backups have at least two

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,260
copies on your website one on your PC

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:27,710
and one hard copy who does hard copy

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:30,390
backups of their websites well then I

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,010
guarantee you that's something happens

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,480
you can't remember what if you did six

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:38,610
months ago update all your web trace

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,210
software plugins translations whatever

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:46,110
is available updated check that all your

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:49,350
films are working remove any spam

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,060
comments from your pages and posts fix

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,790
the broken links how do you fix the

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,040
broken links you get plugins that

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,680
actually checks if there is broken links

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,790
in your site and it's this manner of

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,670
ticking a box and it's fixed so have a

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,160
look there's plenty of plugins that take

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,290
all the broken links on your site take

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,839
your content and remove any outdated

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:18,140
information is there anything I forgot

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,140
to mention

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:31,890
doesn't look like it so how do you do it

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,990
suicide 30 minutes each week for putting

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,450
your diary so you know that it's coming

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,570
up and you need to do it if you busy

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,120
outsource it there's plenty of vias who

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,770
will only die for the opportunity to

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,590
update your site for you if you not sure

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,840
how to do it ask your web developer it's

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,260
part of the fraction to teach you how to

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,200
use your site look it up on the net

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,390
there is hundreds of videos that shows

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,960
you exactly step first a party maintain

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,960
your website

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,120
maintenance what painters so there you

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,750
have it folks I can carry on preaching

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,640
until the Sun comes up tomorrow but it's

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,480
your choice in a responsibility is yours

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,309
you can either have a brilliant website

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,860
that serves you for years or you can

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:38,820
leave it to the dogs and face the

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:38,820
consequences you decide any questions

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,650
hi um I just discovered

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,820
I've got no broken links apparently when

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,059
I run it through the broken link checker

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,100
and everything like that but I was

00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,640
putting a redirect in for a page for a

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,760
301 and I just clicked on this tab that

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:10,580
said 404 errors and I've got 90,000 of

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:15,110
them what this has only happened on

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,530
Thursday okay and I was to say Oh what

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,160
do I do

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,890
okay so your broken link checker it

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,679
should show you exactly which way the

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,320
broken links is does it give you like a

00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:31,070
list of yes so I give you the option to

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:35,420
repair it there in it no okay

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,420
a lot of them like Apple icons they're

00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:42,070
all really yeah and they're coming I am

so something's crawling I don't know I'm

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,550
not technical okay so if you want to

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:52,309

Amanda Queensland sorry yep

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm moving from a cost to a value-based

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,320
structure of our business I'm a web

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,160
designer and I've been thinking about

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,980
offering maintenance packages because I

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,660
have the experience even clients first

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,410
say yes we want to do maintenance

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:52,150
ourselves it's not happening at the end

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:56,330
of the day no one has time to do this so

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:59,360
um I'm at the moment thinking what do

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:03,860
you recommend it or maybe someone else

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,190
can help me is it better to do a monthly

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,830
package a quarterly package every six

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,990
month and I've seen online a little bit

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:17,570
of research so it's a huge variety of

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:21,830
maintenance programs so just something

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,440
like $40 an hour to up to $500 on a

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,990
monthly basis it depends on what you're

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,180
gonna offer and be clear with it

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,810
to the person who's gonna buy the

00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,300
package exactly what is it gonna entail

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:39,950
and then I think monthly is a good start

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,870
and if monthly if monthly doesn't work

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,940
you will probably see it within the

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,190
first couple of months they've got

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,460
yearly I mean speak to you to the people

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,580
who is purchasing this package from you

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,230
and and awesome how what would I feel

00:22:52,580 --> 00:23:00,100
comfortable on doing is it easier for

00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:00,100
them to do it once a year or every month

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,170
a final questions

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:23,170
look yep yes can you give us a some

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,340
examples of what would allude to the

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,790
fact that you haven't done some

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,600
maintenance and it's gone patient well

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:35,230
there this I will go slowly so it will

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,620
take a long time to load also some of

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,960
the the user functionality won't work

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:45,040
like if you have a contact sheet it

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,870
might not seen the message are so it has

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,880
a client come back to you and said I'm

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,160
not happy and therefore shut down your

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:57,400
account or anything like that to the

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:59,080
worst of being hacked or it just depends

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,450
on how the plug-in works if it's not

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,430
being supported any more it will get to

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:07,180
a stage where the league's in everything

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:10,480
we just stopped working and depending on

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:14,800
the functionality it might just not to

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,750
do what they use expected to do so what

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,130
I was asking was have you had any

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,830
personal experience the where it has

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,590
cost you dearly you're not doing the

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:28,090
maintenance for a number of sites or

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:32,260
just a site well I had a client who does

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,480
add salt for weddings she did not do

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,610
updates I mean every time I go in to say

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:44,440
there's like mountains of updates to do

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:46,300
and she got hacked and if she runs one

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,610
wedding a week which size of one winning

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,640
a week a wedding curse like three four

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,770
thousand dollars full flowers in the

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,230
long run she could have lost like say

00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,090
three thousand dollars

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:03,529
the site being done due to being hacked

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:06,679
so it it it's pace to maintain your site

00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,679
thank you

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,799
