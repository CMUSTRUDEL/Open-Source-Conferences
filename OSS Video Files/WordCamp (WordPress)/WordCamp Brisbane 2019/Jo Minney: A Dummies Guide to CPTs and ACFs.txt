all right hi everyone good morning some

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,510
of you who might have been in this

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,700
stream yesterday might have already seen

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,309
my face around my name is Jerry I do

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,560
hail from Perth please don't hold it

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,180
against me I hope we will see some of

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,330
you guys there next year we are running

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,490
our first word camp next year and I just

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,279
want to get an idea before we start on

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,080
who has used custom post types before

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,689
just put your hand up if you use custom

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,850
code so far who's used custom fields

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,160
before like AC air for pods or anything

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,260
like that who has no idea what custom

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,579
post types are custom fields are right

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,320
who hasn't put the hand up yet all right

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,850
cool I just wanted to make sure you guys

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,530
are all capable of putting your hand up

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,739
so I want you to do one more thing for

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:55,590
me

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:58,079
can I just get everyone to stand up that

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,359
squeak right that's amazing so I did

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,860
something when I did my first word camp

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,760
a little while ago in March in Cebu and

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,310
you guys already have a head start

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,990
because you already know what a Mexican

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,310
wave is and I know that you can all put

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,220
your hands in the air and you can all

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,810
stand up so sit back down again and

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,210
we're gonna do a Mexican wave and

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,229
Ricky's gonna film it for me because I

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,549
want to make sure that you guys are all

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,229
the way because I know sir a lot of

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,590
these faces at the after party yesterday

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,619
so we're gonna start from this side all

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,850
right so on the count of three we're

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,350
gonna start a Mexican wave from this

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,500
side are you ready are we filming Ricky

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,500
okay ready one two three go

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,620
brilliant all right I my plan is to do

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,240
that at everyone camp I ever speak up so

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,560
this is the second one watch this space

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,140
in ten years I will have a whole

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,850
collection of them I'll put the video up

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,670
on Twitter thanks so much for doing that

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,350
Ricki so I am going to be talking about

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,230
custom post types and custom fields

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,060
today and I just wanted to clarify right

00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,590
up front what all of these things that

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,850
I'm talking about mean and then there

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,130
were quite a few people that said they

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,440
hadn't you hadn't used custom post types

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,000
or custom fields before so I'm going to

00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,950
explain what a few of these three-letter

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,590
acronyms actually mean

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,110
so CPT is custom post type to C F is

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,420
custom field a CF is actually a plug-in

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,860
called advanced custom fields and it's a

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,570
really common way of actually

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,330
implementing custom fields coming in

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,560
guys and Todd is not actually an acronym

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,820
at all it's just the name of another

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,000
plug-in that I'm going to be talking

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,470
about a little bit so why do we care

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,980
about custom post types and custom

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,300
fields now I apologize if this goes is

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,470
that if this is a little bit too basic

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,600
for some of the developers in the room

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,580
but I think it's really important

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,470
because there are a lot of people who

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,630
are just starting out in their career in

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,370
WordPress or they're using it for their

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,459
own business and they don't actually

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,680
understand why WordPress is so flexible

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,959
and so valuable and the reason why I

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,940
think the WordPress is so amazing is

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,700
because you can use custom post types

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,800
and custom fields to really extend the

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,600
existing WordPress architecture and you

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,269
can build some really funky stuff with

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,730
it it gives you a lot more flexibility

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,650
than just using a plug-in that you get

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,810
off of the repository if you can create

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,430
your own custom post aisles and this is

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,410
actually where I first came across this

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,480
concept way back when I first started

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,459
and wasn't that long ago but when I

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,560
first started using WordPress one of the

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,010
very first websites that I ever built

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,959
was for my community group and we wanted

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,160
to make a business directory and we were

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,870
like cool let's have a business

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,959
directory will support local business

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,100
seems like a great idea at the time by

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
the way don't volunteer with your local

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,100
community group it is very unrewarding

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,390
because nobody ever says thank you but

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,489
we decided we were going to do this

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,049
business directory and so I spent hours

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,670
looking for a plug-in that would do

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,129
exactly what we wanted and I still

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,989
didn't find one

00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,879
and I think we ended up buying one and

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,680
then tweaking it fortunately I'm married

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,170
to a PHP developer so that made it a

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
little bit easier um but I wish that

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,250
back then I had known about custom post

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
types and custom fields because it would

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,810
have been a much better way of doing it

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,610
um it also makes it a lot easier for

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,549
those of you who are building websites

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,250
for other people and they've sort of

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,709
fairly new to WordPress it does make

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,389
content management a lot easier for say

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,539
testimonials if you've just got

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,340
something called testimonials right so

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,530
what is the difference between a post

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,960
type and a custom field in a nutshell

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,669
there's already a bunch of post types in

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,340
WordPress and that's actually how

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,289
WordPress works pretty much everything

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,620
that already exists inside WordPress is

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:37,570
a custom post type so you've got pages

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,530
you've got posts you've got attachments

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,960
you've got revisions you've got

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,270
navigation menus they're all stored in

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,010
the WordPress database as post types and

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,889
then you can create your own lines as

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,330
well and then we have custom fields so

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,979
the difference between a post type in a

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,470
field is that a field tells you

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,630
information about a post or about a post

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,220
type and it can vary depending on what

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,760
post type you're talking about so you

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,979
have different fields on posts versus

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,490
products for example so products is

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,320
another example of a post type so

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,630
examples of fields that you've got your

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,610
title is the author's your sk use for

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,849
your products your price all of that

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,320
kind of stuff that's your fields right

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,910
so where the taxonomy is fit into all of

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,590
this because this one was one that

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,320
caught me out when I first started in

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,260
WordPress and the answer is basically

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,150
there are two taxonomy that come as a

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,650
default with WordPress and you probably

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,960
already familiar with categories and

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,610
tags but you can create your own custom

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,470
taxonomies and they're really useful

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,650
when you need to be able to group posts

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,510
based on a particular field right so

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,220
imagine that you've got a field that you

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,070
can use to display a group of stuff

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,599
that's essentially what a taxonomy is so

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,370
for your training apology's that's so

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:50,260
big Ricky doesn't have my fonts

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,410
installed so just pretend that's like

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,500
handwritten

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,270
so basically if you want to be able to

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,070
group stuff so you want say an archive

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,350
page then you would use a taxonomy

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,110
instead of just a standard custom field

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,360
I know it's been using a couple of

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,720
examples how that might be done so whose

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,550
use we promised before right only any of

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,740
those people did you say that you hadn't

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,630
used custom post types before because

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,950
that's actually wrong oh you have if

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,170
you've used WooCommerce you've used

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,390
custom post types because we commerce

00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,160
itself actually creates products orders

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,610
coupons and refunds in your database

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,290
they're all post types and they also

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,800
create a bunch of custom fields like

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,470
price and SKU let's say I wanted to

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,270
write a blog and I wanted to have a

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,510
bunch of book reviews so rather than

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,160
just using my standard post I might

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,650
create a custom post type for book

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,850
reviews and so I was like cool I'm gonna

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,860
write a book review about Harry Potter

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,560
cuz it's a classic right he doesn't like

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,150
Harry Potter and then I was like what

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,760
would be really cool is if I could

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,200
actually review series as well so I need

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,600
a way of grouping all of the books in a

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,850
series so this comes back to do I use a

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,770
custom field or a taxonomy and in this

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,600
case I used two taxonomy for that so you

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,160
can see in the bottom right that I've

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,180
actually added a couple of custom

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,250
taxonomies there for genres and series

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,720
and there's an example of where I've

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,540
created a custom taxonomy and I'll

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,550
explain how I did that in a second this

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,750
is another example so the directory that

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,220
I mentioned it would have been a lot

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,440
easier for me back then if I'd read

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,050
about custom post types because then I

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,900
could have just created one that had the

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,600
exact things that I needed in there so

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,700
let's say I need to display and a bunch

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,400
of information about charities that I

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,830
really like supporting so everyone know

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,820
what the ally project is yeah if you

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,570
don't look it up they do awesome stuff

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,980
I'm really passionate about

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,260
accessibility if anyone want to have a

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,150
chat about it later she codes Australia

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,160
which I mentioned earlier is a cause

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,300
that's very close to my heart and I've

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,100
been involved with them for several

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,810
years

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,450
so let's say that hypothetically I

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,620
wanted to have some custom fields in

00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,440
there so you can see down the bottom

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,970
here the custom fields that I've added

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,740
in this little meta box of where they're

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,050
operating whether or not they put

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,180
charitable status created contact if you

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,450
want to volunteer and be a sponsor in

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,820
Brisbane Bishop Rhodes Australia so if

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,860
anyone's in there I'll say other

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,840
examples that you might use a custom

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,850
post type for testimonials is a really

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,730
common one team members you want to add

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,470
a photo maybe you want their position or

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,780
something like that

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,910
kittens that you want to rescue because

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:33,560
kins are definitely better than dog oh

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:38,450
sorry Alex but look at that face it's so

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,130
cute I'm so how do I make a custom post

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,660
type there are a bunch of ways and

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,800
there's no one right way it really

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,860
depends on what you're looking to

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,490
achieve so the first way is PHP code

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,160
looks very simple round yes who's made a

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,090
custom post type using PHP before pre

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,850
thinks is that simple yeah all right so

00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,730
this is probably more realistic but this

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,790
is actually more realistic it's a lot of

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,560
code and we actually did this when we

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,680
first started making custom post types

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,210
and my advice would be refer back to the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:17,090
Codex a lot and while when we first

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,350
started doing it we were using the child

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,980
theme and we were just putting it into

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,990
the function so a PHP file since then my

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,600
advice would probably you user must use

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,770
plug-in instead because that way if my

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,110
faster you decide that you're going to

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,980
switch from Genesis to a different theme

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,070
that's a little bit more lightweight

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,970
sorry ripi if you're here so if you

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,530
decide that you're going to switch

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,760
themes later then you don't have to drag

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,170
all of that stuff out of your child

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,390
theme and put it into a new one if it's

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,930
in a mustard plug-in it is also

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,330
according to WordPress the best practice

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,130
and that actually was the reason why we

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,950
stopped doing

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,140
our custom post types using PHP was

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,270
because when Gutenberg came out we had

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,920
to go fix everything because it wasn't

00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,630
actually the way that we've done it we

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,920
had to make a few tweaks and stuff to

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:06,260
make it compatible as Ruttenberg now

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,730
well about a year or two ago we started

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,860
doing that using custom post type UI

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,080
this is a really neat little plugin

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,900
that's on the repository it's been

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,050
around since version 3 of WordPress

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,610
Scott over 700,000 installs works really

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,840
well with page builders for those of you

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,160
that are like Elementor and beaver

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,540
builder fans which are clearly the only

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,310
two page photos you ever need to worry

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,050
about and it but it doesn t allow you

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,530
use the basic fields that are built into

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,540
WordPress already so this is a really

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,520
easy way of creating a custom post type

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,020
and one of the perks of doing it this

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,540
way is that when there are changes to

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,910
WordPress its the developer of CP or the

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,260
developers of CP t UI who are

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,560
responsible for making sure that it

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,540
remains compatible and secure not yours

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,000
so we've actually said we started using

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,710
this a few years back and this is an

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,900
example of what it looks like but one of

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,200
the biggest disadvantages to using CP to

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,030
UI is that the page is very very long

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,440
and if you're new to this and it's the

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,760
first time you've created one you can

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,690
see how that might be a little bit

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,820
overwhelming

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,040
right there's a lot of tick boxes and

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,360
things there and keep in mind this still

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,250
doesn't allow you to create custom

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,230
fields it only allows you to create a

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,360
custom post type so now I introduced

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,250
pods and for this is another plug-in

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,300
that's on the repository and I think

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,010
we're actually doing a whole hallway

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,410
track straight after this for pods if

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,300
anyone's interested in it and I've just

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,610
recently started using this and I think

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,530
it says simple custom post types it's

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,420
actually a really good alternative and

00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,970
so what it does is it allows you to do

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,010
custom post types and custom fields it's

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,630
got a lot less installs and CPT UI it's

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,340
kind of the new kid on the block but the

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,540
community is really active they have

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,510
their own their own slack channel and

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,270
they it's completely open-source so

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,230
there is no pro version so that's a for

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,880
some people that might be an advantage

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,290
for a lot of people that's a

00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,290
disadvantage because it means that you

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,570
also don't have support

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,440
this is what it looks like I think the

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:08,860
UI is much nicer for beginners than CPT

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,240
UI it's a lot less scrolling involved so

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,050
that's the longest page that I could

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,150
find in CPC in our inputs so if you are

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,740
absolutely brand-new to custom post

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,420
types and you want to give it a whirl my

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,100
suggestion will be start off with pods

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,230
and then graduate to something a little

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,760
bit more complicated

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,620
someone actually introduced me to this

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,330
one on Friday I'm not going to spend any

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,980
time on it but if you are a developer

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,310
and you want to like level up check it

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,560
out

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,960
it seems pretty cool one of the

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,570
disadvantages I guess that I saw with it

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,210
is that the interface does require a

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,410
great outside of the WordPress dashboard

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,630
so that you and I think they've got like

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,280
a generator or something so check that

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,570
out if you haven't seen it before it

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,440
looks pretty neat I'm gonna have a play

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,840
with it tomorrow and that's what the

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,870
generator looks like and then we get to

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,210
advanced custom fields did anyone attend

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,830
Alex's talk yesterday about using

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,110
advanced custom fields for blocks

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,370
it was really really interesting and

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,160
that's also what I'm gonna be doing

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,110
tomorrow but advanced custom fields is a

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,490
fantastic plugin it was created by

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,600
Elliot who I don't think is in the room

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,420
at the moment because he did let me know

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,370
that he was gonna have to disappear I

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,850
promised him that I wouldn't bag it out

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,790
so everyone tell him I said super nice

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,250
things about it around but it can be

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,910
used with any post site including things

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,760
like WooCommerce posts so products and

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,250
reviews and stuff like that it can be

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,620
used with existing like with posts just

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,460
your regular posts post types that you

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,590
create using cpt UI or using pods so

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,450
that's really useful it has been around

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,550
for a really long time and it has a pro

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,080
version as well which means if supports

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,250
really important to you that's something

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,500
that I think is it's really helpful um

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,800
they it also is has much better

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,900
integration I think we've compared to

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,110
something like pods with Gutenberg and

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,959
one of the

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,170
perks I think of using ACF is that it

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,850
allows you to add for example people

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,800
just this is what the UI looks like if

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,450
you want to add a custom field and it

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,450
allows you to add stuff on the sidebar

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,800
there which is really nice and it's a

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,089
lot cleaner if you're using the

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,430
guttenberg let's say you want to add a

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,500
custom field to a post if you've got a

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,550
massive long blog post on there you

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,019
don't wanna have to scroll all the way

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,240
to the bottom to add your custom field

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,320
in a meta box unfortunately with pods

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,450
that's the only way to do it at the

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,250
moment so I just want to duck but super

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,290
quickly to the last point on here about

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,510
ACF using the existing tables so I

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:42,829
mentioned that all of the post types are

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,839
stored in the post table right well all

00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,430
of the custom fields and all of the

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,860
fields in general are stored in what's

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,180
called the post meta table and usually

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,390
that's not a problem that's just how

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,829
WordPress works right but it can be

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,320
important if you've got a ton of

00:14:54,829 --> 00:15:00,709
information right and there are very

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,200
small number of times where it can be a

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,600
problem right and I came from the

00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,519
weirdest introduction into WordPress

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,640
ever because I actually came from an SQL

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,130
background so of all of the languages

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,990
that make up the WordPress stack a lot

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,149
of people don't even consider escrow to

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,610
be a coding language it's a very odd

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,680
place to start but to me it's always

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,230
been confusing that that's the way that

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,360
the WordPress databases work and when

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,829
you're doing a lot of queries and you've

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,320
got a lot of custom fields and a lot of

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,690
data it can make a big difference not

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,670
having those things in a column rather

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,959
than having them in the meta fields

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:41,120
table so in pods one of the neat things

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,890
that I discovered is that you can create

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,899
advanced content types and you can

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,380
create custom Pro sites using their own

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,670
custom database tables now while this is

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,990
really cool

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,269
and it's pretty easy to do you just

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,490
activate it from the components menu for

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,899
those of you they want to give it a well

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,420
please don't do it unless you need to

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,790
because it also means that a lot of the

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,830
things that make WordPress WordPress and

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,450
you to use other plugins to do cool

00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,430
stuff you never gonna be able to achieve

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,140
that if it's all in a different table

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,930
and it's looking for something that's

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,970
not there so when you would use advanced

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,430
content types would be things like data

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,620
separation is important or if you're

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,030
doing really big queries then you might

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,170
actually want to consider that and the

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,390
other time is if you're going to be

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,560
resetting your data a lot because if

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,300
you're resetting your data a lot

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,910
especially if you have a lot of fields

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,210
and a lot of data that's basically in a

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,850
meandering massive queries on your your

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,520
post meta database so that's where you

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,710
might want to look into that if you are

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,480
interested in looking at what custom

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,000
fields and custom post types can do I

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,430
really really strongly recommend when it

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,780
comes out watching Alex's talk because

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,500
it was one of the best ones that I've

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,480
seen all weekend so you could work with

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,630
that and I'm really looking forward to

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,670
actually trying out ACF blocks and you

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,440
can actually also do it using that meta

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,910
box dot IO one that someone introduced

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,339
me to on Friday I can't remember who it

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,040
was thank you I'm really excited about

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,410
playing with it and that's pretty much

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,020
it for me I think we're running a little

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,190
bit behind so I don't know if we've got

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,190
time for questions or not

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,539

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,870

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,549
question I will be around in the break

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,640
