Title: Stephen Rees-Carter: Think Like a Hacker and Secure WordPress in 30 minutes, live on stage
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	“What could I have done to avoid being hacked?” is a question you’ll often hear after a site is hacked. In some cases the answer is complicated, but a lot of the time it’s relatively simple and there are many checklists and guides online outlining the ways sites can be hacked, plus how to secure them. However, a lot of people learn better from seeing and doing than reading (often boring) checklists. So rather than look at checklists on slides for 30 minutes, we’re going to hack into WordPress instead!
