Title: Rua Haszard Morris: Cool stuff inside Gutenberg: build the perfect UI with @wordpress components
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	A brief dive into the component library built into WordPress / Gutenberg. Iâ€™ll use a little demo plugin to demonstrate how useful these components are, and how you can use them to build the perfect authoring interface for your custom content, and more.

[Applause]

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,840
okay thank you so much Joe

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,450
so yeah my name is Rua welcome everybody

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,060
fantastic to see a packed room a little

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,800
bit daunting this is my first word camp

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,310
I'm from New Zealand I'm over here from

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,789
Dunedin

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,650
I don't hate Australia used to live in

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,250
Sydney for a while kind of enjoyed that

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,779
Brisbane is really nice so I work for

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,949
automatic I've been working for

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,920
automatic for about a year and a half

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,600
and I work on WooCommerce comm so I

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,430
don't work on WE commerce the plug-in

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,129
and I don't work on WordPress but I do

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,170
work on a website there is a wordpress

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,350
website and uses WooCommerce to sell

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,719
weave commerce plugins so I'm here today

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,370
because I'm quite excited about

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,500
Gutenberg and possibly most you know

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,510
this already but maybe not all of you so

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,250
Gutenberg is the tick behind the

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,189
brand-new block editor that's coming out

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,770
let's come out and WordPress 5.0 not

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,020
going to use the clicker so just before

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,630
I get started on the talk proper let's

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,700
do a little show of hands so I can get

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,450
an idea of where everybody is on the

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,850
Gutenberg journey so three hands up if

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,100
you are excited about Gutenberg like I

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:29,600
am okay

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,250
thank you for those of you ER so now

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,180
throw your hands up if you are using

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,950
Gutenberg for posts or pages and not all

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,490
of them but just any post or page on a

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,310
real site okay great similar number of

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,759
people and so the last one extra for

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,860
experts throw your hands up if you have

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,310
built custom blocks or you're playing

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,250
around with custom blocks right now okay

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,990
this is perfectly pitched so this is a

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,030
warm-up talk to get you excited about

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,290
building your own custom blocks among

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:08,610
other things okay so what is it that

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,110
gets me so excited about Gutenberg it's

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,200
because you can build a block for

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,879
anything so I really love the idea that

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,400
WordPress

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,650
and sites built on WordPress can become

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,170
more diverse more interactive and more

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,530
engaging so it's not just about blogs

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,489
and it's not just about text with media

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,650
embedded it's about much more than that

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,300
so Gutenberg or block editor as a

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,730
platform that we can use to build those

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:40,769
experiences from richer units so we have

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,470
had richer units of content and

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,090
WordPress purple at some time this is a

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,890
short code which I'm sure you all

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,739
recognize it's a short code for a

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,709
gallery so you can do a lot with short

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,510
codes right now but I think with

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,920
Gutenberg we can we can really build on

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,430
this and make it a much greater

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,190
experience for authors and build some

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,720
cool new things as well

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,069
so here's what a gallery looks like in

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,290
Gutenberg I'm sure you've all seen this

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:11,579
already it's much more WYSIWYG it's much

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,900
more alive and so this talk is kind of

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,900
centered around that kind of

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,660
transformation it's about making really

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,470
nice interfaces for your data for your

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,380
authors for your sites that really are

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,910
close to what you're trying to express

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,350
so if you're building a site right now

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,239
or if you're working with a client and

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,280
there's something particular about their

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,739
application or their market that they're

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,870
in and think about that as we go through

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,160
the dry technical details of the talk

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,980
and hopefully you can find some things

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,870
that you can use the Spore so Gutenberg

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,120
is we all know is the block editor and

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,730
but it's more than just the block editor

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,269
it's actually a code library full of

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,250
useful things that you can use and so

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,750
I'm talking about one specific thing in

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,030
particular today in this talk so I'm

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,829
talking about components so before we

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,560
launch into that let's talk about what

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,810
components are so I've got this

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,880
definition out of the react

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,380
documentation and so components let you

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,620
split your user interface and do

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,690
independent reusable pieces and this is

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,609
the most important part for me and they

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,130
let you think about each piece in

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,110
isolation so you can break down your

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,000
user interface or your software into

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,270
smaller chunks that you can then trust

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,789
them

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,400
to do a particular job so what are we

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,349
actually talking about components might

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,550
be a bit abstract

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:39,720
so in this component library inside

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,289
Gutenberg there are some things that

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,150
you've seen before things like buttons

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:48,240
and controls for collecting user input

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:53,310
like text edits date pickers things like

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:58,530
that there's also things like menu bars

00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,150
and you can also have components that

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,449
are made up of other components to build

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,090
a more rich unit so we're gonna look at

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,889
some examples in a minute of these

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,229
before we do that I'm just gonna do a

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,509
very very tiny introduction to react so

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:17,300
maybe another quick show of hands who's

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:20,400
heard of react who's scared of react

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:25,050
yeah I mean I'm comfortable with react

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,599
now but it still scares me so this is

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,060
what react really is at its core so this

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,479
is a JavaScript function and in comes

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,889
some props some little bits of data so

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,990
think about this like what's the data

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,330
that your site's all about so in this

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,009
case our prop is a name and it's Merial

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,110
which I believe is a traditional

00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:48,690
Australian name and so that comes in and

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,710
then our components spits out some

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,520
markup and that's hi Muriel so that's

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,259
that's what a react component is so

00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,940
hopefully there makes react a little bit

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,380
more unfriendly and you'll see this

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
pattern over and over again when you're

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,229
browsing through the guttenberg source

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,229
code or when you're building your block

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,360
okay so let's start off with a really

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:15,569
simple component this is the button

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,099
component inside WordPress so I'm

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,400
showing the code on screen here for

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:22,080
these things don't worry about that if

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,969
you like looking at the code and reading

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,069
what's fear then feel free and all this

00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,419
code is lifted directly out of the

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,620
Gutenberg Project so it's all there on

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,870
github and you can go and check it out

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,509
later it's just to illustrate what I'm

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,919
talking about so we can see that this

00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:40,480
button has props those green things for

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,460
different kinds of behavior and

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,200
properties that you might want so this

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,500
one here is a small button because it

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,500
says is small and it's also got some

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,260
other props to control its behavior and

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,860
to show a value and the label for the

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,990
button is the text that is in between

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,950
the opening and closing tag so very

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:05,410
similar to HTML here's a more

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,780
interesting component so this one gives

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,120
you a lot more out-of-the-box this is

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,910
the form token field and so this is what

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,430
would be used in a post for selecting

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,690
tags but maybe with sites you're

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,670
building you can think of other things

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,290
you might want to use the sport and it

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,010
gives you all that behavior of adding

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:29,970
new tags killing tags all out-of-the-box

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:34,900
in this nice clean little bit of marker

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,240
and here's a much more rich detailed

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,240
component this is a media placeholder

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,260
and this is what you present to an

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,300
author when you've got a block that

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,770
needs a piece of media and it's flexible

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,170
it can be used in different blocks in

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,230
different ways so this example here is

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,120
from the media and text block which is

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:57,100
reasonably new it wasn't on 5.0 I don't

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,720
think it was soon after and so it's got

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,720
guidance for the author about what to do

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,770
next and you pass that in as a property

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,330
and what's really cool about this and

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,080
what's really powerful about components

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,330
is that within this in a

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,930
innocuous-looking markup here is all of

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,150
the code to handle a file upload making

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,130
sure that's the right kind of file and

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,770
that's all very easy to express what you

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,500
need and so we've got here what kind of

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,690
file types we accept and it's just going

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,640
to take care of that for us so that's a

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:35,080
little dive into some components as

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,750
being used inside Guttenberg so you're

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,610
probably wondering what can I do with

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,640
these where can I use these components

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,510
and there's a couple of answers there

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,250
obviously you can build your own custom

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,780
blocks and if you're going to do that

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,890
you're going to be right in there and

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,660
all these components going to be really

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,760
useful to you but you can actually use

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,810
components from Guttenberg

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,450
for other things as

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,130
well so the idea is with this component

00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,590
library that you can use it for building

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,810
experiences in wp-admin so if you're

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,120
building a plugin that has an interface

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,010
for your site administrators or your

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,390
authors that might be nothing to do with

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,890
content and might be something else to

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,930
do with your site you can use these

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,650
components to build that as well and I

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,110
think that's gonna really be pivotal for

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,839
WordPress going forward to make the

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,850
admin experience much more and targeted

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,130
of what people need it to do and be able

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,420
to focus in people's experience on what

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,430
they need to be able to so here's an

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,490
example of that so I wasn't personally

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,279
involved in this but WooCommerce has a

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,770
brand new sort of child plugin that's

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,630
going to be part of course soon called

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,910
WooCommerce analytics and it's been

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,680
built using WordPress components and

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,089
Gutenberg tech from the ground up but

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,650
it's it's nothing to do with the content

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,570
it's nothing to do with the block editor

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,490
it's just about understanding what's

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,930
happening with your sales and that's

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,089
been built using WordPress components

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,370
and so that's an example of the kind of

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,140
fun you can have depending on what your

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,790
domain is and what what you need could

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,950
use this for so you can see they're an

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,110
old friend we've got our form token

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,820
field as being used there and we can see

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,940
a bunch of other custom components that

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,940
their teams built specifically for this

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,630
so let me just switch out to my demo now

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
yep

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,779
so so now we're gonna switch focus a

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,700
little bit there was a bit of a talk

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,589
about technology and so the real reason

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,120
that this talk is that I want an excuse

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,850
to play with this and make something fun

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,230
for myself I like music I like

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,300
electronic music in particular I like

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,180
all music but electronic music is what

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm obsessed with more so I thought what

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,810
if I could build blocks that enabled you

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,100
to add a soundtrack to a page so that

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,870
you could have a richer experience when

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,820
you're learning about say music genres

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,839
or you know you might use this for other

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,000
things as well so I'm not sure if this

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:06,839
is gonna okay so it's coming out of the

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,060
computer right here can you give it

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,329
reasonably yeah okay good and you can

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,709
hear me as well good so at the top of

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,589
the page I've got a play button cloth

00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:19,050
and then I've got a block that's a an

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:22,560
audio loop and this one is a very very

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:26,730
seminal Questor stick no tricks and then

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,820
as we scroll down the page it switches

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,240
over to another example of techno music

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,810
from the more current and if the person

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,209
was reading around in this page its

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,560
phosphate in between those figures thank

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,630
you much so that's the that's the

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,820
experience that I wanted to build and

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,600
Gutenberg was the tool that I did used

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,600
to build that

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,870
I think we'll just go back to the

00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,830
presentation now and so the accept live

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,630
if you wanna have a play with it there's

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,730
a few other pages to play to look at

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,730
[Music]

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:18,450
okay so how did I do this so I'm gonna

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,740
show you another thing that is really

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,300
useful if you're getting started with

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,209
this or if you're quite experienced in

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,830
this area it's just really useful anyway

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:29,880
so this is the WordPress scripts package

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,190
and so what this gives you is a way to

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,399
get all the dependencies you need to

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,850
build on Gutenberg as a library and to

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,410
build a custom block and to have one

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,820
dependency for all that and not have to

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,440
wrangle all the different versions of

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,380
things obviously with JavaScript and

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,790
enpm things can get quite out of date

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,890
quite quickly it's very hard to stay on

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,390
top of so this helps you with that and

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,399
it includes Babel so you can write

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,320
modern JavaScript which is much more a

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,709
nice to work with it feels much more

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,300
close to traditional programming and

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,149
there's also linting tools to keep your

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,220
code standardized you'll see here

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,839
there's a start script which you use

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,220
when you're developing and it'll watch

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,850
your files as you eat it on them and

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,550
it'll build as you go and that allow you

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:21,360
to iterate quickly and have fun building

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,440
as you go and when you are done there's

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,730
a build script which will build a

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,260
production version you'll plug in which

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,800
you can then release it to your

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,480
customers so you have a look at that it

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,070
might be a little bit alien right now

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,720
but if you're going to start down this

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,279
journey it's a fantastic place to start

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,899
and there's lots of talks about it on

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:45,750
the wordpress.org website so but more

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:48,990
detail about how I built my thing thank

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,550
you so I used a placeholder and so we're

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,930
talking about placeholders before so

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,680
when you first drag out the loop block

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,089
into the editing area you haven't got

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,709
any audio in it and so you need to

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,140
choose some media and so that's what

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,579
I've used the placeholder block for so

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,630
I've given a little icon that looks like

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:09,380
a record came out of - icons and then

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:13,850
I've given the instructions to the user

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:16,380
you need to pick an audio file here

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,910
again all this codes on github this is

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,320
all open source so don't worry about it

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,699
too much right now if you are interested

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,110
you can have a good look later or you

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,110
can contact me and we can discuss

00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,670
so there's a tool bar on each block

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,949
inside Guttenberg which you've probably

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,829
seen and so the way you build up that

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,149
tool bar is you use components for that

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,839
as well

00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:41,929
so in our tool bar we have two buttons

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,579
ones to hide the block from the front

00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,589
end of the site so that's just sound and

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:47,929
you can't see any evidence of the sound

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:50,360
that's that little eye button and for

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:54,279
that one we're passing properties

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,860
directly in to the tool bar component

00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,389
we've also got a media upload button

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,860
which will make sure that we've got an

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,360
audio file because it's got a media

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,529
upload chick component around it and

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,660
that's gonna handle all of our media

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,720
upload or selecting from the WordPress

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,279
media library so you get to build on all

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,679
the lovely stuff that's in the platform

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,509
that we've got in a nice clean way so

00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,160
the other block that I built is this

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:23,449
play button block and you can have as

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,399
many of these on the page as you want

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,920
and allowing the user to start and stop

00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,230
the soundtrack and it's got a very basic

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,779
setting it's got the tempo for how fast

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,970
you want the music to play and so that's

00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,999
in the sidebar at the right of the

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,759
editor and so to do that we use an

00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,439
inspector controls component and then

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,299
inside that we have a panel body which

00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:46,699
gives us a little nice place to put

00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,589
controls which can be collapsed away

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:51,740
when the user doesn't need to see it

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,720
anymore and then within that we've got a

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,329
range control which is a way of sitting

00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,519
a number between two values and you can

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:03,410
see here we pass in our playback tempo

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,170
attribute from our block metadata and

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,879
then when the user slides it around that

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,850
will give saved back in to the extra

00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:16,129
buttes okay so that wraps up the talk

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,439
quite a rapid pace so there's a bunch of

00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,119
Link's fear definitely come and talk to

00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:24,259
me if any of this stuff is interesting

00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:25,939
or confusing to you and of course we can

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:27,290
automate it it's wonderful I'd encourage

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,970
everybody to if you're interested in

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,290
there find out about it it's a really

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,689
great place to work and yet there's the

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,440
repo for the audio blocks at the ear on

00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:39,820
github

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,820
so thank you very much

00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,269
do we have time for questions see I

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,999
think we have time for maybe a couple of

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,189
questions so we are running about ten

00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,410
minutes behind so we'll try and keep

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,970
them nice and short and sleep and I'm

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,839
sure the rule are we mine answering your

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:03,290
questions after during the day or we can

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,140
say all day he says so hold him to that

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,260
so do we have any questions who wants to

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,939
start us off everyone just really wants

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,990
like Buffy right now come on I know

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:17,149
someone's got a betting question yes

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:23,480
wait grab a mic up for this gentleman up

00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:26,600
here Thanks

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,600
I built blocks using ACF I'm not

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,370
experienced with react so any benefit

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,980
that you get from react from working

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,440
with react at its core versus using ACF

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,659
to building your own blocks that's a

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,890
pretty good question so I'm not hugely

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,179
familiar with ACF affect there's gonna

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,860
be a talk that I'm gonna go to later

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,669
that I'm gonna find a little about that

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:50,120
I guess if that's working for you that's

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:51,889
great you know keep doing it there's a

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,450
couple of benefits that I could see from

00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:55,340
going with the kind of more direct

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,320
approach one is that you're kind of

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,270
upskilling in an area that seems to be

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,500
taking over the whole world right now

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,270
so the more you can learn and be

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,460
comfortable with react there might pay

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,409
off the dividends in other places and as

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,450
far as keeping your site lean and your

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,639
code base focused on exactly what you

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,350
want to deliver then going straight to

00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:14,389
the platform that's built into WordPress

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,940
is always gonna save you no bites on

00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:19,639
your server powers time compile-time and

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,830
run-time javascript when you're editing

00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:23,270
in the block editor the more things you

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,340
have running the slower that experience

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,190
is going to be for your authors so there

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:32,649
could be a effector oh yeah thanks for

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:35,950
the question awesome any other questions

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:38,480
going once going twice

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,490
yes we've got a gentleman up here in the

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,389
middle can we get a microphone to this

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,389
gentleman here please

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,980
okay um there were a lot of references

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:59,150
in your code to things that weren't

00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:02,180
previously defined where do you find all

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,660
this stuff yes so I've taken a very tiny

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,910
snippet of code out so yes that code all

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,620
came from the gutenberg repo on github

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,930
which is right there so take a photo of

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,970
a slide if you're curious and I will put

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,090
up a blog post about this at some point

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,360
and are we making slides available to

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:23,270
people so yeah yep

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,190
find me I'm hasari anywhere on the

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,380
Internet as so sorry that's me or

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,390
Kathleen beets calm and we'll show you

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,280
about yes so all the code is in the

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,100
Gutenberg Project there is much more to

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,010
it I wanted to present clean things that

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,480
head missing rhythms as easy to say yeah

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,550
and the other code was and the audio

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,090
blocks repos it's very small and

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,070
pantograph it's a little hex file and

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,800
just by the way that demo is that live

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:52,670

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,290
Camp cotton beats comm so feel free to

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,010
have a play around with it or stick it

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,060
on to the next party or at what's the

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,390
