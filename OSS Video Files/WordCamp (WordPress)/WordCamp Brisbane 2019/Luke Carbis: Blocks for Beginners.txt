Title: Luke Carbis: Blocks for Beginners
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	So by now you’ve had a chance to check out the new WordPress editor. You’ve created some posts using Paragraph Blocks, experimented with the Image Block, and maybe installed a plugin that adds some brand new Blocks.
Now it’s time to create your very own Custom Blocks. It’s easier than you might think. Using just a little basic HTML, CSS, and a simple helper plugin – Block Lab, we’ll create our very own Hero Block.

oh thanks Mikey hi I'm Luke and I have

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:22,199
been working and messing around with

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:26,279
Gutenberg Oh see since since basically

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,630
you know it was in beta stages and it

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,040
was starting to come out and I would be

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,770
really interested to get an idea from

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:44,100
the room who here has not yet had a real

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,870
hands-on play with Gutenberg oh wow

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,989
that's a lot of people considering that

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,789
it's it's actually in WordPress you know

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,129
it's like it's a it's actually released

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,910
and I'd say most of the people here

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,780
haven't used good berg out of the people

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,480
who have used Gutenberg on a scale of

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,119
like one two three one being you don't

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,840
like it in threes you love it how do you

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,850
rate it

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,659
can I get or I mean even if you've

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,619
messed around with it a little bit can I

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,409
get you one

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:24,060
one's head ends up a couple twos okay

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:27,650
and threes okay most people into most

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,829
people right in the middle okay and then

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:35,180
gosh all this hands up stuff so so I'm

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,009
also want to know when I get an idea of

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,460
where do you sit in terms of technical

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,570
ability put your hand up if and we'll

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,729
keep it up for this one

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:50,340
if you've modified your theme before

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,890
okay and keep it up if you maybe have

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,820
written your own theme or plugin with

00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:02,070
PHP and keep it up if you've got some

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,140
experience writing JavaScript for

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,829
Gutenberg with react or something like

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,039
that yeah there's still some hands up

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:15,120
but a lot of them have gone down

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,329
and I wonder if that's partly the reason

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,109
why we've maybe this room in general

00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:25,530
hasn't got such a crash hot opinion of

00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:28,530
Gutenberg and for me I love it I use it

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,569
every day I blog with it I'm all over it

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,000
and I developed for it and I have a lot

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,390
of fun with it but I absolutely see this

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,060
need for regular people for regular

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,639
agencies developers who might not have

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,530
taken the leap to learn JavaScript

00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,870
deeply that there's this real need to

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,519
figure out how can we embrace Gutenberg

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,669
how can we give our clients the

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,079
Gutenberg experience and that's that's

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,579
something that's that's kind of

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,549
difficult and kind of hard to wrap your

00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:00,840
head around until now and that's what my

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,959
talks about today so here's my second

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,959
slide

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,690
so today's talk is for you if you're the

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,610
kind of person who wants to learn how to

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,860
build blocks and you're the kind of

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,890
person who is familiar and comfortable

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,080
with HTML and CSS maybe even comfortable

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,360
with putting in a little PHP template

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,760
tag and that's maybe where your ability

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,010
stops or maybe it goes beyond there but

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,890
it's always nice to do things a little

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,290
bit easier when that's possible yeah so

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,080
what we're going to do today is a little

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,120
bit a little bit out there and a little

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,349
bit nerve-wracking and it's the sort of

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
thing that they tell you when you're a

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:53,310
speaker never do this we're gonna do a

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,319
live demo and not only are we gonna do a

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,769
live demo but we're gonna build a block

00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,140
from scratch and you are going to decide

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,650
what block it's gonna be how does that

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,630
sound

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,760
do you think we can do it in the space

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,880
of this talk think you can build a good

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
invoke block yeah all right so the first

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,310
step is we've got to figure out what

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,209
sort of block we're gonna build has

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:21,450
anybody here had an idea for a block

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:25,370
that you wished existed maybe keep it on

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:30,810
the simple side given that we're we're

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:33,240
limited in time but yeah go for a table

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,310
it's a good one there is actually built

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,400
into good bergen native table block but

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,300
we could explore building our sort of a

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,660
custom table does anybody else over

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,840
there

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,690
a team member oh yeah I like that one

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,200
that's pretty good so you'd have like a

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,880
profile picture of them maybe their

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,349
title and their name oh yeah that's

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,700
great

00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:03,930
yes testimonial block also really handy

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,370
yep pictures and people yeah yeah that

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,669
makes sense

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:12,300
one other or no well why don't we take a

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:15,780
vote we could do testimonial block we

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,970
could do a table or we could do the the

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,539
team member with you know the photo and

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,279
the title and all that sort of thing so

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:28,199
hands up for

00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:33,659
the first one the testimonial ends up

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:36,689
for the table book hands up for the team

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,779
member oh looks like the team ever wins

00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:42,539
alright cool so when we start thinking

00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,609
about building blocks the first thing

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,239
that we really want to do is figure out

00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:50,369
what the block looks like so I don't

00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:53,429
know what design tools you might use I

00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:55,919
know I work with some agencies that like

00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:57,209
I've embraced figma figmas fantastic or

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,129
maybe you're on sketch or something like

00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,709
that but I always just like to start

00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:03,449
with pen and paper so let's start

00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,199
thinking about this block we'll put it

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,199
in a rectangle

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,570
now team member what do we need so let's

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,240
call out to me some of the things that's

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,690
going to be on this block photo all

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,100
right we could do photo in a circle

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,050
where do we want to put it in the middle

00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:38,720
on the side top optional top left middle

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:41,810
okay yep we can make all these fields

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,820
optional you know the sky heads are

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,390
laughing on my picture that's not very

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,910
nice

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:50,350
I heard someone laughing at my picture

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,350
and that wasn't very nice I was offended

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,390
all right I think we should feature

00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,410
their name like fairly prominently up

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:03,410
here maybe like and then below that

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:06,100
their position yeah the title yeah all

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:10,880
right we'll put that slightly lower

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,620
anything else contact details I heard

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,230
all right yeah that's a good one I'll

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,270
put that on yep about a little

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,850
description all right we'll go with that

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,430
so let's let's set aside an area here

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,220
for this is gonna be you know some text

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,590
and then we maybe we'll put like our

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,810
social buttons at the bottom like he

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,530
emails Facebook Twitter yeah

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,810
all right how does that look to everyone

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:42,350
good so let's think about this a little

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:46,040
bit more we're gonna need from over here

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:49,940
we're gonna need an image

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,320
we're gonna need what's this is their

00:07:49,940 --> 00:08:00,230
name now we might call this like a

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,430
profile photo and that's an image we're

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,030
gonna have a name that's just going to

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:10,030
be a text field same here with the

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,030
position

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,459
over here this would be what do we call

00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:23,020
this bio nice that's more than just one

00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:27,819
line of text we might use a text area

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:32,019
for that and then we're gonna have these

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:38,229
three social buttons and they're all

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:44,229
gonna be URLs yeah email Facebook and

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:46,360
Twitter URLs all right does this seem

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,040
like a familiar process to you in terms

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,079
of design how you would normally go out

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,389
about building website cool let's put it

00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:59,800
together this is where we move into the

00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:02,259
live demo mode I'm if you don't mind

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll just drop the lights down a little

00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:10,660
because so that you can see my screen a

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,430
little better how's that and all right

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,230
well this is code but let's switch over

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:19,180
to WordPress all right so this is this

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,009
is a wordpress install I put together

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,689
just just now I'm going to switch to my

00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:29,410
child theme so that we can make some

00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:32,889
changes to the theme later on and to

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:37,149
build what we've designed I'm gonna open

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:39,819
up block lab so block lab is a plug-in

00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:42,040
that's available for free that really

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:46,360
sort of enables us to get through most

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,130
of what we need to do here all right I

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,529
got my my design

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,589
I got block lab here I'm just gonna

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,310
trash this example block for now and add

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,259
a new one

00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:01,060
so what's it called what are we gonna

00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:05,860
call out a new block team team member

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,959
that's it yeah team member and before we

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,589
add our fields I like to just go in here

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,170
and choose an icon that one works nicely

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,620
and we'll put it in our common we'll do

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,589
all right

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,360
and we'll go ahead and add our fields so

00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,820
the first one was we'll put in their

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,280
name first

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,980
and that's just a textarea a block lab

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,950
has these extra fields here for help

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,080
text and default value placeholder text

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,180
that sort of stuff but we'll leave that

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:40,110
for now we don't really need that for a

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:42,210
name you can put in here title oh no

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,910
we're going to call it position when it

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:52,920
when we alright we're gonna have their

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:56,820
profile photo all right and here we

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,590
change the field type to an image you

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,590
can see the options for that change to

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:07,800
little close that and then what have we

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:13,560
got next the bio this is going to be a

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:17,790
text area because that and then we have

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:23,340
email we put it will ask for the email

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:27,390
address and then we can do a mail to

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:38,400
link that way we might put in the

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:40,950
facebook URL and Twitter now if I was

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,840
doing this for a client I might choose

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,750
to fill in a little bit of help text

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:52,260
here like I might put in here a link to

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:56,610
the team members Twitter because we

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,140
don't want just the at handle that's not

00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,910
going to work for us

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,630
although you know we could work around

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,220
that but there we go we could even put

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,370
in some placeholder text to help with

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,370
that

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:19,420
okay and we'll hit publish and that's

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,839
done so pretty quickly we've already

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,730
built out the structure of our block and

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,259
now we're just going to work with

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:32,050
familiar languages like PHP HTML CSS to

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:35,199
build out the block itself now I'm not a

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,519
CSS whiz so any front-end devs in the

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,500
crowd might have to give me a hand as we

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,449
do that so what we have to do is we're

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,629
just going to create inside of our theme

00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:46,779
a new theme template alright for our

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,930
block and it's in here 2019 child slash

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:55,269
blocks slash I'm gonna copy this block -

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:57,670
team member so here I am in my my editor

00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:02,439
I've got a blocks folder already in my

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:06,069
theme create a new file there looks the

00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:08,319
team - member dot PHP and I'm good to go

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:11,019
I can start writing out my template so

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,319
what's it going to look like start with

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,319
the div

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,610
alright now we want the profile photo I

00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,050
could use flexbox or something fancy

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,310
here but I might just float it to the

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:32,829
left if it's okay with you I'm even just

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:38,290
gonna use this straight image we'll just

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:42,180
leave the source out for now and then we

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,350
want the name you might put that in h2

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,199
I'm just stuffing this out we're gonna

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,370
put the position in h3 any SEO experts

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,519
you have a problem with that we'll put

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:58,750
the bio in a paragraph let's just put a

00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,680
few little comments in here you know

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,680
make this the name

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:15,829
position bio and i will put in maybe

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,190
these social things inside of another

00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,190
div

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:33,889
all right let's get super fancy actually

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:34,339
instead of using a div we use a UL what

00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,930
do we think

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:46,790
good good call all right we're gonna

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:48,500
have email Facebook and Twitter

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:54,430
obviously this is going to be blank to

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,430
start with but just to test it of works

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,649
all right so that's it that's my

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,449
template pretty straightforward we'll

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,610
we'll have to make sure we fill all this

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,410
in in a second actually put in these

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,190
values but let's just see what it looks

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,889
like so far and what in in WordPress if

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,949
we refresh this page we can see now this

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:21,740
is the template that it's using and in a

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:26,839
new tab I'm just gonna edit my hello

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:30,709
world post here all right I'll skip

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:34,399
these tips insert a new block here's our

00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:37,130
team member all right none of these

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,699
actually do anything yet but why not

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:46,060
fill it in call out a name to me I miss

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:46,060

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:57,710

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:04,450
resident sorry tech head all right

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,680
geez I you know in anticipation of this

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,120
talk I did download a couple of example

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,830
images we might use but I don't know if

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,830
I got any of a person let's find out

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,080
we've got it we've got someone pouring

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:24,650
coffee

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,600
that'll do we'll drop that in and all

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:35,470
right any any copy writers in the

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:35,470
audience oh yeah okay Oh dollar

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,740
all right

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:56,630
[Music]

00:16:44,740 --> 00:17:05,230
Fred G and you okay we'll leave out

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:10,250
Facebook because yeah Facebook the real

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:13,549
Fred Nick all right now if we click away

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,289
from here we'll get a preview now our

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,909
preview isn't what we plan to for it to

00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:19,579
be but you can see already that we've

00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:21,409
got that h2 happening in there and we've

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,780
got our dot points which is really nice

00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:27,289
I've noticed that I've just noticed this

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,990
now is that our 2019 theme includes some

00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:32,530
predefined styles for the h2 that I kind

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,150
of don't like no I could sort of just

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,500
counter those in my stylesheet but

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:42,169
instead of doing that I think will

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,260
change to h3 instead see if that helps

00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,549
we'll change this to h4 it is just a

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,039
quick workaround because I don't like

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:55,909
those 2019 things that's a bit nicer

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:58,580
all right back to our template next step

00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:02,390
is we're going to use a couple of really

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:05,320
really simple PHP functions to pull

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,750
through the data from our block into

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,970
into the template here so we need to

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,390
know these field names that's what we're

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,070
going to be using first one is name and

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,460
I we can do it really simply here I'll

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,230
just get rid of this we're going to use

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:29,630
block underscore field and then put in

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:31,950
name so this here this name is this yeah

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,130
all right

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:39,930
and then we can do the same thing we

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:43,590
just copy-paste this block fields would

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:47,120
be closing position all right and then

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,120
we can even do the same for buyer

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:59,650
all right now the image let's just see

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,810
what happens when we put in block field

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:06,730
image what did we use profile photo yeah

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,580
okay we'll come back to the social in a

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,920
second let's have a look we can just

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,230
click in and then click out it loads it

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,490
again we've got our image that's nice

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,660
and a name that's all looking good

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,340
obviously we need a little bit of style

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,600
happening but we'll get there in a

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,900
second

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,660
all right let's put in our socials now

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,180
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,970
a little bit of a PHP chunk at the top

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:40,060
here and we're going to pull through

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:42,400
into variables our email and instead of

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:46,080
block field which outputs the value I'm

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,910
just going to do block value email and

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,680
that returns it so that I can put it

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,310
into a variable hopefully that makes

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,670
sense to you

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:58,440
we're going to do the same for Facebook

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,440
and Twitter

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,350
I'm just going to check that those are

00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:12,460
the right names email address there we

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:18,749
go okay and then down here what we can

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,749
do is we can just do a simple if book

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:33,210
I'm going to do if not empty email and

00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:33,210
then we can do echo

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,500
will do here

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,530
email all right so we're just checking

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,630
to see that we've actually got an email

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,750
address in there and if there is one

00:20:48,630 --> 00:21:03,120
then we'll output it inside of a list

00:20:51,750 --> 00:21:05,790
item okay now I'm I'm in favor of coding

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,230
standards as as the next guy but there's

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,280
a live demo we want to get it through it

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:15,570
quickly so don't nitpick on me for that

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:19,260
all right so if empty email now put the

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:22,880
email empty Facebook and Twitter anyone

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:26,400
see any mistakes here looks good

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,890
okay let's have a look see what happens

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,460
now in our block we just click in here

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,860
click out again there you go and so you

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,530
notice we didn't put in a Facebook so we

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,990
didn't get that out again so that's how

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:43,560
we use block field and slightly

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:45,090
different block value the next step you

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,060
could probably imagine we're just gonna

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,310
create a new file here block same name

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:56,640
block - team - member but instead of dot

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:59,960
PHP we'll call it dot CSS and and now we

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,960
could start doing things like this

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,420
let's see we're gonna go float:left

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:23,520
height 100 and 50 pixels with it's gonna

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,020
be Auto something like this it's not

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,030
going to work with border-radius if I

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:32,480
just did an image so I have to put it

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:38,510
the image inside of an wrapper here span

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,510
class equals profile photo

00:22:49,680 --> 00:23:01,260
and then border-radius 75 pixels and

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:04,920
then we can do this image with hundred

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,920
percent that's a like I said I'm not a

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,480
CSS expert or front-end expert but I

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:15,180
think that should do the trick

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:21,810
yeah maybe no we might have to refresh

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:22,380
to get that CSS overflow really oh yeah

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,060
you're right

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,410
you need overflew here nice

00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,150
well that's sorry that forgot to save it

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,060
before I got rid of that now we have to

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,480
put Fred back in ah sorry about that

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,480
everyone

00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,480
all right

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,020
okay well it's getting there slowly

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:10,340
we're gonna need a bit of padding here

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:13,090
why is that overflow not working oh no

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,090
padding margin

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,420
Oh

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:28,520
pickled that display:block nice work

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:33,470
oh no I'm gonna just go update this it's

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:35,990
no fresh there we go look at that say

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:42,770
that's that's we didn't actually need

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:45,350
too much more than that so of course all

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,260
we have to do here is view post and

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,630
we'll see it on the front end same here

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,980
I guess we maybe want to write some CSS

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:57,200
because our rap is not working I'm

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,350
guessing there's some Styles applied to

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,760
the header but you get the basic idea I

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,410
went I went put you through the ordeal

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,270
of me trying to get those into circles

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,810
but if you're a front-end developer I'm

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,910
sure you can do that but you get the

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,700
basic principle here some of the things

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:19,160
you can do with this though is it can

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,290
really go even much further beyond this

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,820
like you might decide that you want to

00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:27,980
build a block for your we're commerce

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,260
products all right and you might want to

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,700
put them in slay a slide show or

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,370
something like that and you can put in a

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,170
repeater and have you know populate them

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,080
with each each one with the product or

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,480
something like that and and you can go

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,690
nuts you can use WP query inside of your

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,530
block to create a query and pull through

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,390
particular posts and show them the

00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,820
possibilities are as endless as any old

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,460
theme template which is what's really

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,650
exciting to me makes building four and

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:02,870
developing for Gutenberg a lot more fun

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,680
and a lot more accessible so that's

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,960
that's me

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,420
that's block lab I hope that you found

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,480
this so useful if you want to check out

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:17,270
block lab you can at get block lab comm

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:20,590
I would like to take questions yes

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,590
hang on just brings

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:32,120
so the million-dollar question is why is

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:36,860
WordPress not built this interviewed me

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,030
why is WordPress not built this well

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,100
sometimes I want to answer people will

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,780
you'll have to ask WordPress but of

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,940
course you can't because WordPress isn't

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,100
any one person it's a community of

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:54,200
people making decisions together I think

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:57,270
part of the reason speaking honestly is

00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:03,380
is the owners for Gutenberg and if

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:06,090
you'll allow me a little side thing here

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,080
okay sir I'm gonna go off track a little

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,690
bit this will be fun

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,170
so the best Internet ever was the

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:15,750
Internet in like 2004 right 2005

00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,640
something like that when there was no

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,520
sort of centralized place for everything

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,590
everything was messy everything was kind

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,810
of ugly and he had it was hard to find

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,700
stuff that you needed but gosh it was

00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:30,420
fun and you could discover and you could

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,210
explore right and the essential idea of

00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,820
the Internet is that it's a distributed

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:38,870
system right so web distributed around

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,370
the world and you can end up anywhere

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,950
these days it's getting less and less

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,870
distributed right like we have Facebook

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,550
lots of people think Facebook is the

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,360
Internet and you can find almost

00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:53,700
anything there Google is now not letting

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,170
any its visitors see your site it'll

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,600
pull through the content of your site

00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,310
onto the search results right there it's

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,980
becoming less and less distributed all

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:04,020
the time I think that's a real problem

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,780
because because I believe in this vision

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,580
of the Internet I believe in this idea

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,340
that the way it should be distributed

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,080
that content creators like you should it

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,530
should be easy for you to put what you

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,350
want out there but the reason why it's

00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,360
becoming more and more or less and less

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,420
distributed more and more centralized is

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,490
because it's consuming content on those

00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,830
platforms is a lot funner it's a lot

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:34,680
more user friendly it's a better user

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:37,680
experience right and so it's it's sort

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,740
of hard for us as publishers as content

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,150
creators to

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,720
content out there that competes with

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:46,510
that so how do we find a solution well

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,730
to me that's what goods but Gutenberg is

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,890
about good Berg is about making it

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,100
easier for content creators to put stuff

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:57,010
out there easy to put people like us to

00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:01,330
create these highly engaging interactive

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:04,120
like high quality content all over the

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,130
internet just not just in one place but

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,970
in order to do that we need to build a

00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,740
product to Goodin burg which isn't only

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,440
working with this major driver of the

00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,700
internet WordPress but also works with a

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,380
lot of other platforms

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,230
did you know lots of people don't

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:23,920
realize but the latest version of Drupal

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:28,210
has Gutenberg built into it good book

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,700
was originally created the sorry the

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,920
current version of Drupal works with

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:38,170
good book and good book was created for

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,590
WordPress but the big picture of

00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:44,460
Gutenberg at least to me is to get these

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,260
tools to create these engaging

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,760
experiences into the hands of everybody

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,940
who wants to create content on the web

00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,160
not just word presses but anyone in the

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,590
distributed web so in order to do that

00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,230
we can't be platform-specific it can't

00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,210
be just tied down to PHP we have to

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,679
build something that has uses some of

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,790
the more difficult modern technologies

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,080
sorry it was a bit of a rant but

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:12,820
hopefully that answers your question we

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,340
had time for more questions there is

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,320
also a bit of a change in tact our

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,790
speaker for the next presentation has

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,650
not showed so we're gonna do an

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,910
alternate session so while we're

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,490
organizing that let's just keep the

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,880
questions going you know I have a

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,770
question over here to your right

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,140
it's Patti question about that block so

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:35,200
would it be easy enough to then create a

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,950
block called team list that you could

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,809
drop on to other pages using that

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,150
content that you just created yeah

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,760
absolutely the only change that I would

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,190
make in that case is that I would create

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,320
a repeater field as my first field in

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,039
block lab and then put all of those

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,999
fields that we did create as

00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,489
fields of the rapido hopefully that

00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:00,529
makes sense but but that would just then

00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,330
allow us to go new team member new team

00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:09,019
member new team member D team member and

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:11,359
fill out all of those fields okay given

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:13,700
what you said about Gutenberg being used

00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:17,239
in Drupal and if there's a laravel

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,539
plugin for it too now how easy is it to

00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:22,519
export from block club into a format

00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:24,679
that you can use standalone without

00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,909
having to install block club yeah it's a

00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,269
great question it's something that we

00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:32,210
get asked a lot which is wouldn't it be

00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:34,460
good if I could take my blocks that I've

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,070
created and export them to put them on

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,320
my client sites maybe without needing

00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:42,289
block live installed and the answer is

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:48,259
that in shipping in WordPress 5.3 in

00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:51,169
November is a new a block directory and

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:52,429
I'm still coming up like still learning

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,769
about what it does but my understanding

00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:57,229
is we're gonna have in WordPress we're

00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:59,690
gonna have plugins gonna have themes we

00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:01,700
can have blocks all right as a separate

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,889
thing for the first time or you can

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,629
install these custom blocks and this is

00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,369
a new thing coming to WordPress and

00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:09,499
we've been waiting to see what that

00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:12,229
looks like and see what the format for

00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:15,139
that is before figuring out how to

00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:17,960
export does that make sense so long term

00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:20,599
vision is maybe if we can lock lab would

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,649
love to be able to export blocks but

00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:25,789
we're waiting to see what that looks

00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:27,980
like in core big round of applause for
