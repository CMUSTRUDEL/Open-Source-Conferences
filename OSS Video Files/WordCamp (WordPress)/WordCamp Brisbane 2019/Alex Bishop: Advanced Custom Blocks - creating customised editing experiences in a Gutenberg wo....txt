Description: 
	The block revolution is undoubtedly here, but not everyone has been able to embrace it yet. If you’ve never used ReactJS before it may seem intimidating, or at the very least time consuming to go all-in on the new editor and create custom blocks for every situation you come across.

[Music]

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,200
[Applause]

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,420
hello fantastic alright well I mean as

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,180
has already been explained time is of

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,910
the essence we've got to do this now all

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,029
right so this is advanced custom blocks

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,760
today I am focusing on a popular plugin

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,590
called advanced custom fields and how we

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,109
can use it and I guess some of the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,180
skills that a lot of us already have

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:35,100
that we've got from developing themes

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,020
plugins just WordPress websites in

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,730
general and how we can transfer those

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,890
and you know like create some crazy

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,110
experiences in the block editor and all

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,170
of that kind of stuff now it's the

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,910
afternoon we're all a bit tired so if

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,170
you can please humor me I need to get to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,390
know my audience a little bit

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,989
can I ask everyone to please stand up

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,989
out of their seats

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,080
thank you okay

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,180
now I would like you to sit down if you

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,470
have never heard of advanced custom

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,810
blocks before now

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,260
I mean advanced custom fields sorry

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,410
who's who's never heard of the plug-in

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,690
before now okay cool

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,610
who has never used it sit down if you

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,610
have never used the plug-in all right

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:26,240
okay cool

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:30,440
sit down if you have never used the pro

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,940
version of advanced custom fields all

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,450
right Ellie will be very disappointed in

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,250
all of you sitting down for those people

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,460
that are left standing I'm very curious

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:45,800
to know sit down if you have never used

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,140
the flexible content field yeah all

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,000
right okay so I'm gonna be talking to

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,470
about ten people in the room which is

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,840
just amazing but like we said we're

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,430
talking about now and what is really so

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,040
special about now so you can all sit

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,100
down okay and now I guess is really a

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,690
big time of change for WordPress and in

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,970
order to talk about now we might just

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,369
need to quickly breeze through a little

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,170
bit about before because I noticed at

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,700
the start of you know today when we're

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,140
going around the room there's a lot of

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,150
new people here they're new to word

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,530
camps they're new to WordPress and maybe

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,890
they just don't actually understand what

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,900
the fuss is all about but way back we

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,870
had this thing here this is called the

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,459
classic editor now that lovely big white

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,769
rectangle that you see up there where

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,660
you could paint your masterpiece all

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,980
right but pretty soon people realize

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,450
that that wasn't enough to make the

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,400
website of their dreams and people

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,560
wanted to do more and so they turn to

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,660
this stuff called meta fields but the

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,420
built-in user interface for meta fields

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,769
is quite frankly very poor all right

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,890
don't tell the court devs that but it's

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,440
horrible and so people realize this I

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,950
started making custom ones and doing all

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,560
of that and that's where we meet a CF or

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,080
advance custom fields it is a plug-in

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,570
that takes the that weird kind of like

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,970
text key value store thing that we just

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,489
saw before and turns it into these rich

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,810
user interfaces that make putting in

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,370
like customized content

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,450
an absolute dream so we have things

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,910
there like you can see it's a color

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,200
field as date pickers there's even just

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,880
you know plain stuff like text and

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,459
paragraphs and we can do things like

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,200
require content to be set or we can

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,110
dynamically hide and show sections

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,030
depending on values that people pick and

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,099
in general it's just like you know a

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,959
much much better experience for this

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,910
kind of you know custom stuff that we

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,489
might want to do in the admin so for me

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,709
as a novice web developer discovering

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,200
ACF made me feel all of a sudden like a

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,900
wordpress superhero all right all of a

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,150
sudden I went from kind of like fiddling

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,819
around with things in the WYSIWYG to

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,010
being able to design these really cool

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,709
editing experiences in the admin using

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,420
the GUI the ACF provides and I managed

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,890
to bumble my way through some templating

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,319
code and all of that kind of stuff and

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,660
get it out put on the front end and all

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,370
of a sudden it was just amazing

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,739
I could do whatever I wanted with

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,930
WordPress my clients loved it I was

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,670
having a good time and in general life

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,530
was just pretty good you know we got

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,350
some new fields over time I didn't

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,450
really go back I kept using ACF however

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,430
when the flexible content field was

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,310
released that kind of really changed

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,910
everything so what this enabled you to

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,910
do was to define these groups of fields

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,320
called layouts so it'd be a group of you

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,330
know you could place more fields into a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,070
layout and then you put a collection of

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,720
layouts together into this flexible

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,340
content field and when someone's

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
authoring that content they just come in

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,910
and they go I would like to put some

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,530
text in and then they see the text

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,820
fields and I would like to put the call

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,680
out in and then they see the fields

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,200
related to the call-out and you could

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,590
just build up your page using these flex

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,600
content fields and pretty soon myself

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,490
and a lot of other people from what I

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,760
can gather online realized all of the

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,340
power that this presents and they pretty

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,360
much stopped using the regular WordPress

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,010
content entirely

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,930
we just started hiding it or turning it

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,660
off or whatever and doing everything in

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,669
this flex content way because also when

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,260
it came to templating it was so much

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,120
easier right we could write this like

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,680
basically there's one statement and

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,110
almost have one template for the whole

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,529
website so what this does is it just

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,329
fine

00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,149
what the layout name is called and it

00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,739
loads a template file called that layout

00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,029
name and so all I need to do is

00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:32,429
basically just go through and make sure

00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,559
that the names match up and all of a

00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:36,509
sudden now I can develop my websites in

00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,539
a totally different way so rather than

00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:44,849
relying on fixed pages now we started to

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:46,469
build modular blocks and also all of a

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,199
sudden you know now clients can just

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:51,179
come in and add more it used to be when

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,229
I first started using custom fields for

00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:54,929
example you'd have to get the

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,789
specifications of a website like totally

00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,989
on point because if the you know the

00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,129
client would come back and you'd be just

00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,449
about to launch the website they'd go oh

00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,759
yeah we need another paragraph or an

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,379
image right here okay I'll go put in

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,599
more fields I'll go change the template

00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,169
code but you can see here that you can

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,729
just add new ones in and that loop that

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,089
I showed you before will just kind of

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,269
like take all of that into account also

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,679
and this was a huge thing at the time

00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:22,499
vertical ordering of content stopped

00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,449
being a problem when we were using fixed

00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:26,789
fields we had to make sure that we got

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,739
the order right okay so if we wanted the

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,629
map you know to be before the contact

00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,399
form but after the paragraph or whatever

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,659
yet to make sure it was that way in the

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,249
template we had to make sure that

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,249
hopefully the fields lined up in the

00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:40,289
admin to or someone would get confused

00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:43,469
this now you can see you can just drag

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:46,349
and drop it around and it was really I

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:51,110
mean in my mind kind of the precursor to

00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:51,110
the modern browser that we have now

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,729
after discovering all of this I have to

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,109
say life was pretty good all of a sudden

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,359
were developing you know WordPress

00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:02,129
websites in this new way and we were

00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:04,469
happy you were productive it's fantastic

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:08,219
and then of course you know it's as

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:10,649
always time for change ok Project

00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,019
Gutenberg was announced you may hear me

00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,669
refer to Gutenberg or the block editor

00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,429
throughout this talk and they are the

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,809
same thing I apologize if I use one or

00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,209
the other at certain times but they're

00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,519
interchangeable but the block editor was

00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,199
announced and all the people like me who

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,369
were absolutely crazy about advanced

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,899
custom fields were very worried because

00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,610
I've gotta admit I don't I was not

00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,619
really a big fan of the classic editor

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,569
akai always losing any sleep over losing

00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,669
that

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,749
big rectangle apologies to the person

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:44,479
from tiny MCE who's here but what I

00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,300
missed is that I could change all of

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,849
this right like using the skills that I

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,619
had I had PHP skills and I had you know

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,029
HTML skills all that kind of I could

00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,219
change all of this stuff I knew the

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,020
actions I knew the hooks and I could

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,409
just turn it into a blank canvas where I

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,969
could put whatever I wanted and then it

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:04,969
comes out that now all of a sudden I've

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,800
got this and I don't have everything up

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,110
here that's all the react application

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,759
now you can see that it expands a little

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,959
bit but it's still not really enough for

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,469
like a whole content authoring

00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,639
experience and so you know we're all

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,139
just sitting there going like what are

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,699
we gonna do what's what's gonna happen

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,379
and I think that you know in general

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,749
like we were just really worried about

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,089
the change partially I think because

00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,769
we'd spent time building a system that

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,990
worked for us and we're always so

00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,149
protective of things that we have

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,919
created ourselves alright whenever

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,750
something new comes along we're always

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,089
just at a rush to be like nope I've

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,800
invested so much time into this that it

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,069
can't possibly get replaced it can't

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,779
they can't possibly be something better

00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:47,209
but it sort of turns out that I got to

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,759
have my cake and eat it too and so did a

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:53,600
lot of other people because since ACF

00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,000
pro version 5.8 or greater we can now

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,899
use like the same field interface to

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,920
create these custom blocks and once

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,300
again life was good so maybe you're just

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,430
sitting here wondering like why don't we

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,930
just make native blocks we have already

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,990
had some fantastic talks about that

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,139
today why don't we just replace flex

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,709
content with native blocks sometimes

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,959
honestly you can so I have made flexible

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,810
content fields in the past before that

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,420
just contain like a simple sort of

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,769
assortment of fields so we put a heading

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,660
block in there and we put like a

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,310
paragraph on in there and an image and a

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,949
YouTube and all that kind of stuff and

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,600
we just find that clients would often be

00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,790
able to use that still easier than the

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,380
classic editor something like that is

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,610
the perfect example to just get

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,199
straight-up replaced by the block editor

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,790
however for some of these other things

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,610
where we've created these really custom

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,100
experiences we still want to cut

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,250
demise the editor so we're gonna need

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,440
some way to do that one of the ways that

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,720
one of the reasons why I really like

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,250
using ACF blocks as opposed to native

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,220
blocks is we get full control of the

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,680
markup at render time I'm not saying

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,300
that is impossible with native blocks

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,060
it's just a lot easier with ACF blocks

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,680
and I think really the big thing the

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,240
really the big thing is why people don't

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,709
want to sort of get into native block

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,170
development is that they've like

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:20,440
perceive it as being a steep learning

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,200
curve I must say though it is getting

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,209
better we've seen some things like

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,410
rulers talk this morning I thought was

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,000
very interesting and they talked about

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,709
that he talked about the WP scripts

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,930
project how that's making it easier for

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,000
people to get into react development by

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,380
removing the hassles of managing your

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,410
build process and all that kind of stuff

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,329
but it's still well you know there's so

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,310
much good stuff there but it's still a

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,600
big change it's still a huge change

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,860
especially if you're not used to writing

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,779
modern JavaScript es5 or years next

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,160
react is different the paradigms of it

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,170
all are different you know there's just

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,990
there's a lot going on there and most of

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,940
us are busy man like I work for an

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,100
agency we are pumping out the websites

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,430
obviously you know we take time to make

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,240
sure it's done right but for they're

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,740
flying out the door and not everyone has

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,260
that luxury of just being out of drop

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,970
everything learn new stuff and then you

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,740
know pick up where they left off we have

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,480
so many legacy applications that we've

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,880
got to maintain and have solutions for

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
them and so I guess we're looking at all

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,089
right how can we progressively introduce

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,709
this or how can we start getting some of

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,920
the benefits of the block editor today

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,070
without completely changing everything

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,180
all right so hopefully now you're

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,160
starting to come around you might be

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,699
going well if I'm going to use this ACF

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,079
blocks thing am I getting a watered-down

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:40,029
experience am i you know is this like is

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,560
this block eight it's a light or

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,589
something like that because I'm using

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,910
this and for me I really feel like the

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:52,449
answer mostly is no so native blocks can

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,610
be static or dynamic and I really like

00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:58,240
that a CF blocks are all dynamic so a

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,220
static block when you save it that block

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,630
may define some additional HTML

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,440
something like that and that gets saved

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,390
into the

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,700
in the database if you change that

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,140
template you need to update the posts in

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,450
order to change the mark-up for me

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,100
that's a bit silly it's why I use

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,920
something like WordPress is to have an

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,390
abstraction over that so I really want

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,640
dynamic blocks where everything's

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,140
rendered server-side so that if I if the

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,620
client needs this to change across the

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,850
entire website right now it can for me

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,690
that's kind of like what I love about

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,670
using a CMS in general so the data is

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,640
decoupled from the design like I've been

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,160
talking about and I find for us that

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,230
makes our development a lot faster the

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,390
the portability or compatibility between

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,280
I guess our old solution and the new one

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,540
also makes our development a lot faster

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,560
and we're going to get into that in a

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,870
little bit as I mentioned ACF blocks are

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,180
registered using PHP so you'd do this

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,670
within a theme or a plugin and you don't

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,460
need to know any react or like you know

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,350
WP blocks JavaScript API any of that

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,880
stuff great stuff to check out if you

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,230
have the time but you don't need to know

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,640
any of it to use ACF blocks and finally

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm sure there would be some people who

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,710
are familiar with ACF that are wondering

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,380
how the data is saved so it's not saved

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,570
in post meta like it used to be for

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,880
things that are within ACF blocks it's

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,520
actually saved as a JSON literal object

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,800
in a HTML comment because I guess this

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,720
is like the gutenberg compatible way but

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,240
it is important to note that like it's a

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,940
really great replacement for say if you

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,850
were using flex content or other fields

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,130
to replace the content of your wordpress

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,350
post however if you were using meta

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,140
fields i guess as more what i would say

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,350
is like actual meta if it was more

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,060
something that you would query by as an

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,250
example or sort by or like something

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,490
like that or is just like an additional

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,780
piece of information that you want to be

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,730
able to you know fetch out the database

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,740
separately then maybe it's still best

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,880
suited like actually being a meta field

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,220
and living in that drawer down the

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,540
bottom and in that case probably weren't

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,070
really considering like you know flex

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,500
content or anything like that in the

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,540
first place either so it doesn't mean

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,260
that post meta or you know regular meta

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,730
fields have completely gone away okay so

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,290
what's the learning curve like how much

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,339
time we talking here we're all

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,470
see people if you already know about

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,029
using flex content and have like built

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,680
some templates for that or something

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,870
like that you only need to learn one new

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,670
function you should be Adam basically

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,680
walk out of this talk and just go do it

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,959
because it's that simple

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,120
if you've ever written a child theme

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,040
theme or plugin then it will be really

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,540
easy for you to pick up because you have

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,730
some knowledge of I guess what it means

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,079
to edit PHP within WordPress maybe where

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,540
some of the files live and things like

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,579
that if you've never done any of that

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,800
before if you've never used advanced

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,899
custom fields or have never edited the

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,970
PHP of your WordPress website then it

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,380
may be a little bit harder but all of

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,300
that difficulty is going to come from

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,269
the more general concepts surrounding

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,130
those things and not ACF blocks in and

00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,810
of itself it's just that I guess you

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,329
have probably a little bit further to

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,160
get up the ladder before you can use it

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,360
with the same fluency as you know people

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,730
that are used to doing that kind of

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,459
stuff

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:16,300
all right so we on board should we get

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:19,750
into it I will not be sacrificing to the

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,190
live coding gods today so I apologize so

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,660
when it's gonna have a lot of code on

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,980
screen and that kind of stuff but here's

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,540
here's where we really I guess start

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,970
getting into it so the usual disclaimers

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,389
you're making edits use a child theme

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,790
edit and test locally do not test will

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,440
make changes in production to your Shore

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,750
better yet have a testing and deployment

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,220
process do you want to know more about

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,550
that Rachel I've had a couple of beers

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,730
I'll be yelling it at you later tonight

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,760
okay so it all comes down to this one

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,279
function was introduced in ACF five

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,430
eight it's called ACF register block

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,010
type args is variable there it takes an

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,620
associative array of arguments and they

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,750
define I guess how our block behaves and

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,240
you know what we what we need to do to

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,829
get it all up and running so let's check

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,720
it out on the left here we're going to

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,480
have the arguments and then on the right

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,980
this is the block selector in the block

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,300
editor okay so this is like a piece of

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,500
the block editor where you go and you

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,240
click on the plus and it's like a new

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,740
block and I'm just going to use that to

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,110
maybe highlight how some of the choices

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,730
that we make here affect what we see I

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,069
now I just realized there's actually a

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,060
slide missing from this but I'm using a

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,070
fictional example

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,630
as we all need to do for demos my

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,440
fictional example was a website about

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,090
dogs called good boys hope you all enjoy

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,250
it and so we're building a featured dog

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,270
oblak alright let's just let's get

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,820
around it so the name is the unique name

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,130
for this particular block so this it's

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,960
like an ID for your block it should be

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,480
globally unique you cannot have two

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,680
blocks that exist with the same name so

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
you may want to prefix it with like a

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,940
namespace you could do like my theme

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,950
slash whatever but in general it's like

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,290
think of it as like a slug or an ID

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,830
avoid spaces I wouldn't capitalize that

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,340
kind of stuff is just going to get messy

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,900
alright the title so the title is what's

00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,910
displayed up here it's like the human

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,410
readable nice name of the block and you

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,510
can see it highlighted over there in the

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,220
in the block selector make it

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,280
translatable that's what those sort of

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,750
you know wrapper tags there are and then

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,670
we also have the description which is

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,520
not shown on this particular part of the

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,070
editor it's in the top right when you're

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,570
actually editing the block itself we

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,980
have the category blocks belong in

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,330
different categories and as you go

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,490
through the block selector they're all

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,730
separated out into the categories so

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,680
I've put this one in embeds you get to

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,730
define an icon for your block and it

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,350
will take a like the name of a - icon

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,580
you can also pass it an array if you

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,470
want to specify foreground and

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,870
background color for that icon you want

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,550
it to look a bit snazzy or if you really

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,890
want to get fancy you can also pass it a

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,540
string that is an SVG so you can just

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,210
pass an SVG straight in there for a

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,460
custom icon and finally we have some

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,590
keywords which help when we're searching

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,330
so now with the block editor and people

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,460
adding additional plugins and us making

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,750
custom blocks we could end up with so

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,800
many blocks that it's really hard for

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,310
the client to find the one that they're

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,930
looking for

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,510
so then being out to find it through

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,880
search is actually an important thing so

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,620
we can define synonyms here which may

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,710
not be the actual thing in our name but

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,240
you know what they can find it by so

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,820
this kind of stuff is really all like

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,650
meta about the block you know it defines

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,060
like what it's called and you know what

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,970
the title is what category it's in all

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,640
of that kind of stuff the next few

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,730
things are I guess like the real meat of

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,050
it all so the first thing is render

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,880
template

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,610
so we passed this in if you want to use

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,640
render template you pass it in the full

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,500
path to a PHP file and this is where

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,210
your markup and everything will live

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,190
this is where you'll make your you know

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,140
the field calls and all of that kind of

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,720
stuff and do your regular ACF thing and

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:03,550
so you just pass it in a string that

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,770
goes there you also or not also you have

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:09,160
the option of instead providing a

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:12,730
callback so you can provide a function

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,650
name as a string you can provide a class

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,180
method if that's what you want or you

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,460
could provide just like an anonymous

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,900
function I think even like an in vocable

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,360
object I'm pretty sure anything that

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:26,350
satisfies like PHP scorable type will

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,060
work and so you know that way if you

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,170
maybe have some conditional logic you

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,970
want to run before you select the

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,060
template or something like that it can

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,280
it can happen if you define both for

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,270
some reason you just want to overachieve

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,700
render callback will actually take

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,580
precedence so that one will get run and

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,640
your template won't be loaded styles and

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,970
scripts are very similar so we can just

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,800
pass it in like you know something you

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,760
know just a style sheet or a Java Script

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,760
what am I trying to say a Java Script

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,410
file and they're both optional you don't

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,000
need to load additional styles for your

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,100
block but if you do they'll get loaded

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,420
in both the admin and on the front end

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,170
and they will do so on an as-needed

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,220
basis so if the block isn't on the page

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,220
that style sheet doesn't get loaded

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,980
javascript and CSS has been more

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,980
complicated these days and so sometimes

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,080
we might end up in situations where you

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,580
know a style sheet or a Java Script or

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,290
something like that has dependencies and

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,570
WordPress has a great system for handing

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,370
this already however this kind of like

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,340
simple quick interface that we've seen

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,750
above is just meant for you know getting

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,730
up and running really quick or really

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,160
simple scenarios if you need to also

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,260
like make sure that your assets

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,990
dependencies get loaded call the regular

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,120
sort of like wordpress WP and cue script

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,580
or whatever functions then you can do so

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,900
within one of these sorry I've got to go

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,200
through all over again that's just not

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,200
going to work

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:54,049
through one of like the callback so

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,570
again you pass in any of the callback

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,730
types and then from there you can call

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,360
the regular WordPress script and all

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,509
that kind of stuff no I can't just skip

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:09,529
past this but you know hopefully now

00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:11,149
you'll really remember it okay cool so

00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,279
like I was saying it's very similar to

00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:15,139
render callback takes any callable type

00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,679
let's actually look at some code for

00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:21,049
making a block now so as I mentioned

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,480
good boys our example is dogs because

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,730
what's more wholesome this is minimum

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,830
viable block registration basically that

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,480
we're doing here firstly we're going to

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,490
check if the function that we want

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,049
exists so this lets us know if we're

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,190
using a version of advanced custom

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,080
fields greater than 5.8 also notice that

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,269
we're we're doing our add action call to

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,789
like hook in registration function we're

00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:45,440
putting that on a CF in it so this is

00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,929
kind of nice because it means that it

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,990
won't run unless advanced custom fields

00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:53,779
is also active and and you know like

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,559
running so rather than putting on like

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:58,820
wordpress in yet or something like that

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,590
this is our register block type call

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,409
it's basically the same things that I've

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,230
been showing you on the screen there and

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,580
this is a Minimum Viable template

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,350
technically you don't need this stuff

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,990
but it's a good idea to just pop that in

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,899
there this deals with some common

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,639
guttenberg kind of class names and

00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,080
attributes that the editor passes

00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,649
through to you to deal with things like

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,570
layouts and alignments so you don't need

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,580
that but it's a good idea to have that

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,570
for all the blocks and as far as the

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:33,559
actual block goes I can there we are you

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,700
can see down the bottom it's just a very

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,409
static thing at the moment I've just

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,389
written hello well there I'm not calling

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:40,490
any of my dynamic data it's just hello

00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:42,769
well like we just want to get something

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,509
showing in the admin so as a final step

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,999
we just need to attach a field group to

00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:50,600
it now when we go to the field group

00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:54,220
drop-down we have block as a you know

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:58,330
location option and we can set that and

00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:00,649
from there we should be good so

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,879
found it and now you can see like the

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,710
hello world just output because we're

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,120
not using the data and I've set one

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,769
custom field on this block over on the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,500
side and it just lets me pick like a

00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:10,580
custom post alright so again we're just

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,590
we're just trying to get up and running

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,789
but you can see the field over here and

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,559
the output up there so let's just skip

00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,629
forward a little bit past the kind of

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,100
hello world thing and get to the point

00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:24,139
where you know I've actually defined

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,059
some markup and some styles for that

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:30,710
block so that's just you do that like

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,389
you would regular HTML and CSS and so

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,519
now I guess this is more of like the

00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:37,070
finished block so you can come in here

00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,740
and pop it in come over here and select

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,659
a dog and then I go fetch that post and

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,610
use that post to then dynamically

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,190
populate the data of that block and you

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:50,059
can see that as we update and pick a new

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:52,070
dog the content changes so this is like

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,480
a live sort of like preview in the admin

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,860
which is definitely something that we

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,840
weren't really able to do with with

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,269
flexible content so and once more life

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,259
is good

00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:05,120
we're we're kind of back to where we

00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:07,669
were before and now we have this almost

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,750
like supercharged flexible content block

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:12,980
in the block editor so it's like you

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,730
know we've got our old kind of like

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,009
customized

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,139
interfaces back and we've got some cool

00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:22,789
new tricks like I showed you there with

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:24,799
preview mode so you can also click over

00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:28,070
to edit mode which just renders out the

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,690
regular ACF fields in the editor there

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,580
this can be really good if you have lots

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,440
of fields or you have like old field

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,240
groups that you know have multiple

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,669
columns of fields in them and and you

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,809
know like complex things like that

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,419
having them over in the sidebar over

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,870
here might not work for you so you know

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:46,639
you can just use the edit mode there

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,909
just really quickly if you are someone

00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,960
that has a lot of flex content I don't

00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,820
think we're going to run through this

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,230
just for time reasons but go check out

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,870
the slides when the posted online this

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,809
is like a three minute speed run of me

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:03,230
converting a Flex content block into an

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:06,169
ACF block takes that long so go check

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,850
that out we'll skip past that tips for

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,139
breaking up flexible content as well

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,789
this might be better off to come and

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,230
revisit this at another time but

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:15,320
effectively there are lots of ways

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,419
that you can get your field definitions

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,280
out of advanced custom fields you can

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,890
use their local JSON feature to like

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,440
save them as JSON files or you can use

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,770
the PHP export and you could quite

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,809
easily using a text editor cut up those

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,190
files to them like take out the sub

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,840
field groups and define them as their

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,809
own top level field groups we've done

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,010
that in extreme cases worst case remake

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,360
the fields it will probably take you

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:43,700
like 10-15 minutes ok so just going a

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,870
little bit deeper here's some lesser

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,990
used arguments of this stuff of register

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,900
block type and it can do some cool stuff

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,370
so post types we pass that an array of

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,320
post types that we want this block to

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,650
support and it will be hidden on all

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,299
other post types alignment we can set

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,190
the default alignment when it first gets

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,780
loaded into the editor and same with

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,309
mode we can choose if we want it to come

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,620
into preview mode or if we want it to

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:11,990
come into edit mode and then finally

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,790
with this supports array we can also

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,470
turn some of these things on or off or

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,080
like limit the options of them a little

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,990
bit so down here in a line I've chosen

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,510
that I want to support the full and wide

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,820
alignments I could also pass back false

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,440
and turn off alignments all together and

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,080
that little toolbar would then disappear

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,910
from the gutenberg block same with mode

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,049
you can disable preview mode if you

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,690
don't think it's really going to work

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,340
for your field group or maybe you know

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,809
they're kind of like thing that you're

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,000
outputting on the front end is way too

00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,380
hectic to having the admin so you just

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,720
want to turn it off and just only see

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,070
the fields multiple is the cool one you

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,179
can set it to false and then they can

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,440
only put one of those blocks into the

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,640
content which i think is like really

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,040
neat ok so now you've kind of seen what

00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,570
it takes to get you know a block up and

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,590
running and there might be some

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,169
developers in the audience that are

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,669
considering taking that step but those

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:06,290
people that haven't really worked with

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,280
the block editor before I'm a

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,990
particularly those that are coming from

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,240
a PHP background I guess here's some

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,549
bonus tips for just dipping your toes in

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,530
the water a little bit this is a really

00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,210
cool blog post on synchronizing color

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,000
palettes between the guttenberg color

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,470
picker and ACS again there's a link in

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,010
here so when the slides get posted

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,260
online come and check it out

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,020
it's pretty easy to disable custom

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,520
colors and font sizes in Guttenberg and

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,760
if you're building websites for clients

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,290
I'd almost highly recommend that you do

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,460
so it's just a couple of add themed

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,320
support calls you can get rid of them

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,299
and you can also using a couple of other

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,710
filters you can define your custom color

00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,000
palette and you can define your custom

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,380
text sizes and all of that kind of stuff

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,299
have some really nice consistency

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,020
throughout you can filter the available

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,309
blocks again it's just another filter

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,870
you can do things in there like test

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:57,700
what the current post type is all that

00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,990
kind of stuff make sure you don't filter

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,260
out your own custom blocks that you've

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,299
just spent all this time setting up and

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,970
you can also add your own custom block

00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,950
categories using PHP if that's something

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,840
that you want to do so again another

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,120
filter and the documentation for this is

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,750
on the kind of developer Doc's and

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,280
everything finally if you're a big flex

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,230
content user you may have discovered a

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,419
project called timber does anyone here

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:27,190
use timber can I get like any hands and

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:29,290
yeah there's dozens of us anyway

00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,880
I love timber like I really love

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,340
building WordPress websites using this

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,280
framework called timber and it gives you

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,110
an object orientated interface into you

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,150
know WordPress introduces some kind of

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,850
polymorphism to your templates and

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,070
WordPress objects and it lets you use a

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,830
temper a templating language called twig

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,230
which I'm a huge fan of but if you want

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,880
to render your blocks using timber and

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,559
twig here's pretty much how you get it

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,440
done this is your render callback that

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,020
will handle you for any block as long as

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,100
a file of the same name exists within

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,299
like you know views such blocks and yeah

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,200
that'll just kind of like pass in

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:10,559
context than any arcs applied to it and

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:14,440
this is just the same sort of template

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,390
that has been edited to now kind of

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,000
contain twig tags and all that kind of

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,340
stuff this is just to show the

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,809
difference to the one before but in

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,549
reality you would probably actually

00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,720
break it up into subcomponents because

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,730
that's kind of the whole idea of using

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,080
something like tweak so this is a little

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,510
bit more complex might look a little bit

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,799
more foreign but in the time that we've

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,809
created this one block we've also

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,270
created three reusable components that

00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,280
we can then I guess combine in other

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,750
so you know we've been talking a little

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,100
bit about components on the front end

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,960
and how it's great to have these

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,670
discrete things that are reusable and

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,460
kind of have like an API in terms of

00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,800
okay we pass this in and we get this out

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,420
you can use like language templating

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,570
languages like twig you can even make

00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,550
the same thing in PHP if you really want

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,110
and that whole concept I think still has

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,120
a lot of value on the server side as

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,680
well not just the front-end it's great

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,990
to have these little template parts that

00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,910
have an own API and so you can do things

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,590
like adapt them you know you can make it

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,480
so that you can just pass in a post or

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,620
you can pass in custom params and kind

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,390
of get the same result anyway finally if

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,090
you're really nuts and I'm coming up to

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,640
the edge of my time sort of here you can

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,820
look at defining your blocks and your

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,200
register block calls as class instances

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm not going to go too deep into this

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,500
because I feel like if you're doing this

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,030
you probably nuts and you have a very

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,590
opinionated way about how you would do

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,620
it and you're gonna disagree with my way

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,850
okay but you can do things like extend a

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,530
base class that handles all the

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,360
registration for you or you could use

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,430
like a service class or like manager

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,810
class to sort of register them you can

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,130
do nice things when you sort of been

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,870
within the PHP environment like

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,240
dynamically detect if the template files

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,100
or scripts exist and then cue them and

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,630
if you're doing that kind of stuff I

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,740
highly recommend that you use an auto

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,910
loader because it makes the entire

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,920
process so much more fun alright so just

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,300
breathe you through all of that really

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,040
heavy stuff there but I just want to say

00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,960
like it's definitely a new time for

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,710
WordPress it's a big time of change and

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,950
change can often be uncomfortable you

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,480
know it's it's always hard and it always

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,130
I guess is one of those things where we

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,900
struggle to feel like maybe these skills

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,960
that we've invested all this time into

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,310
aren't worth anything anymore and I

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,780
guess today I really just wanted to

00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,330
present some things to you and show you

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,670
that we can still do some like really

00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,210
amazing things just using I guess the

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:34,180
WordPress skills that we already have

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:37,030
you know we can embrace the block editor

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,570
without retooling and retraining using

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:44,470
ACF blocks and I mean yeah I just like

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,060
to say that really like you shouldn't

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,070
let the technology kind of hold you back

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,299
if you want to learn react learn react

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,190
if you already know PHP and your comp

00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,349
there you can do some incredible stuff I

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,499
just encourage you to get out there and

00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,809
build an experiment and try it all out

00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:01,639
so special thanks to our organizing team

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:02,779
and our sponsors without them I wouldn't

00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:05,539
be able to stand here and talk to you

00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:07,459
all this afternoon I'd also like to

00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,959
thank Elliot from advanced custom fields

00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,639
for graciously giving me some of his

00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:13,729
time on the lead up to this talk to help

00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,649
me prepare I would like to thank frame

00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:16,969
creative the people that I work for for

00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:19,669
our flaming out here to speak to you all

00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:21,049
today we're a branding and digital

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:25,639
agency based in Adelaide South Australia

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:27,559
I am Alex James Bishop you can find me

00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:30,849
on Twitter there I kind of just post

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,849
programming memes and that's about it

00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,749
and remember life is good it is the best

00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:37,399
time now to be a web developer that

00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:38,959
there ever has been there's so much

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,459
stuff out there and the level of choice

00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:42,799
that we have can feel a bit crushing or

00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,509
overwhelming at times but honestly it's

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,129
all this great stuff you can take it or

00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,239
leave it and it's up to us I guess to

00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,499
decide where we go from here

00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:50,649
so thank you very much for having me

00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,649
today

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,750
[Music]

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,130
we have time for any questions five

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:07,870
minutes all right all right

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:11,340
hit me we've got one up there apologies

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,340
in advance if the answer is I don't know

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,380
have you ever tried to convert like

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,750
write a script that will convert your

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,280
flexible content builder into the new

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,800
blocks that you create like is there

00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,190
like you've taken a website you've

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:30,250
created all exactly the same blocks

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:33,100
converted it no to be honest like that's

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:36,130
that's really something that would have

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,710
absolutely been my jam about six months

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,160
ago I've kind of turned over a new leaf

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:45,540
recently of like not spending 20 hours

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,070
automating a task that takes 30 minutes

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,720
so I've sort of like been actively

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,730
trying to stop myself from doing that

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,590
kind of stuff because I used to over

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,510
optimize on the autumn ization front I

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,430
think that it definitely would be

00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,860
possible you just need to decide what

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,600
format you want to work with them in and

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,630
my recommendation for that would

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,240
probably be the JSON format so have your

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,940
theme like how do you know about the

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,560
JSON format for us yep yep yep so I

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,330
would just work with them because like

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,430
you can just really easy pass him into

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,470
an associative array and I think that it

00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:20,290
would be very easy then to split out

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,450
those each of those like layouts just

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,040
off into its own group thin and you just

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,350
need to like work out a way of coming up

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,270
with I guess like unique group names and

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,920
stuff like that because they need to be

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,330
globally unique you could literally just

00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,700
like generate them on a time stamp or

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,530
something like that so yeah would would

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,000
be definitely something you can do if

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,850
you wanted to do that would be a great

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,020
WP CLI a kind of like thing I think that

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,760
would be like the ideal kind of

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,860
framework within which you'd build

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,460
something like that but I haven't

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,460
personally done it

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:55,759
sinking a beer at the after party can I

00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:58,549
ask one more question yeah sure so it's

00:34:55,759 --> 00:35:00,829
not too wrong to believe you would turn

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:05,029
off everything in Gutenberg and just

00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:07,940
build your own blocks you can but I

00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:10,640
actually that was my initial reaction I

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,740
think that some of the things that you

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,480
get in Gutenberg just out the box are

00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,890
almost like kind of kind of better like

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,559
particularly when it comes to text

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,349
content so I actually really like having

00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,269
individual list and paragraph and all of

00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,650
those kind of like blocks even like some

00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:28,009
of the stuff like button and heading I

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,799
leave all of those on and I don't I try

00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:33,220
not to make a CF blocks anymore that use

00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:36,230
the ACF WYSIWYG field because like where

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,119
we're instantiating like tiny MCE within

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,400
this whole like block editor and it just

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,990
gets really JavaScript heavy so you

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,029
could do that particular if you're

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,400
building from scratch but I actually I

00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,480
really do enjoy the the text editing

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,339
experience of a lot of the Gutenberg

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,119
stuff I just build blocks for custom

00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:56,660
things okay cool

00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,710
yep so maybe this was implied before but

00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,180
when you were talking about hey there's

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,759
this one function you need to learn to

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,440
register an ACF block yeah and there's

00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,200
certain arguments you pass to that those

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,099
arguments looks very familiar are they

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,839
identical to registering a regular block

00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:15,740
because it looked a lot like the same

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,930
ones I believe it's very similar but no

00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:22,029
it's not actually quite the same okay

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,029
that is Elliot

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:31,730
yeah yeah they're the same but yeah my

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,050
understanding is like like some of the

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,560
supports and stuff is a direct

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:39,710
correlation supports I think definitely

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,839
lines up with support but yeah yes so

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,900
the arguments that you can pass into the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,420
PHP function exactly the same as the

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,920
native JavaScript props but with a

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,500
little bit of sugar sprinkled on top so

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,640
you get some extra stuff in there like

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:59,599
the callback and the assets JavaScript

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,579
and CSS type stuff yeah yeah which is

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,250
called so it means that any time that

00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:09,400
the Gutenberg developers add new

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:11,839
properties to the JavaScript API the PHP

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,220
ACF equivalent will just inherit that as

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,910
well all right awesome

00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,910
any other questions

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:31,240
howdy what some examples of like custom

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:34,030
blocks that you've built for people okay

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,560
well I'm not on really like my computer

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,380
or anything so I can't sort of like show

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,130
you but what we typically really try and

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,350
do is similar to what you saw with the

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,650
featured dog block is we try and make

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:50,260
really simple interfaces that generally

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,000
do like pretty complex things under the

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,330
hood so that way the client can crop

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,600
them really easily we have a stock set

00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,920
that we pretty much install on like any

00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,600
any kind of website some of them aren't

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,800
needed anymore now that the plugins and

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,570
stuff of caught up so we used to have

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,830
like a gravity forms one and all of that

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:09,130
kind of stuff because we just needed it

00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:11,590
but now they've got their own however

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,000
like yeah a lot of the time we find

00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,610
ourselves again and again and again like

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,500
just having this thing called a combo

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,970
block or a feature block or whatever I'm

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,320
pretty sure everyone knows we would have

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,150
seen something like what I'm talking

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,470
about there's an image there's a title

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,000
there's some text and there's one or

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,410
more buttons and it's laid out in a

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
number of different ways but those items

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,770
are like always there we pretty much put

00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,350
one of those on every website because

00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,850
like everyone wants one and then a lot

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,410
of the time after that we're looking at

00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,640
things like post grids and related

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,350
objects and stuff so they might just

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,180
pick a category and we'll automatically

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:43,450
pull in like you know nine posts from

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:47,140
that beyond that like getting into more

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,790
complex things I feel graphs so using

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,560
like a JavaScript front-end like

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,180
graphing library and just people

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,480
supplying some like numbers and

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,880
parameters in ACF and then we pass that

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,310
into like you know I was using like apex

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,290
charts I think with you and you know

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,950
outputting like a dynamic animated graph

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,740
on the front end even like we are

00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,870
starting to build things more with the

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,890
kind of view frameworks I'm like like

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,690
view reactants felt and so a lot of the

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,150
time yeah we'll just like create a block

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,190
that defines any of the component like

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,990
props or params and then just passes

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,780
them straight through into it as a JSON

00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:28,600
object so yeah so you can do you can do

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,710
pretty much anything but we find a lot

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,870
of the time our clients have pretty

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,520
similar need

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,320
the content and then we just build

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,520
blocks where you know where they have

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,290
unique needs so we are we done timewise

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,460
done yeah awesome thank you so much for

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,460
having me today guys telex

00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,460
