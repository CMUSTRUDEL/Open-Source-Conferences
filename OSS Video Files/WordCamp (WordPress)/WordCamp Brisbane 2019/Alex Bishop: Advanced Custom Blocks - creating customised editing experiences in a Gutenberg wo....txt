Description: 
	The block revolution is undoubtedly here, but not everyone has been able to embrace it yet. If youâ€™ve never used ReactJS before it may seem intimidating, or at the very least time consuming to go all-in on the new editor and create custom blocks for every situation you come across.

[Music]

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,200
[Applause]

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,420
hello fantastic alright well I mean as

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,180
has already been explained time is of

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,910
the essence we've got to do this now all

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,029
right so this is advanced custom blocks

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,760
today I am focusing on a popular plugin

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,590
called advanced custom fields and how we

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,109
can use it and I guess some of the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,180
skills that a lot of us already have

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:35,100
that we've got from developing themes

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,020
plugins just WordPress websites in

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,730
general and how we can transfer those

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,890
and you know like create some crazy

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,110
experiences in the block editor and all

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,170
of that kind of stuff now it's the

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,910
afternoon we're all a bit tired so if

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,170
you can please humor me I need to get to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,390
know my audience a little bit

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,989
can I ask everyone to please stand up

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,989
out of their seats

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,080
thank you okay

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,180
now I would like you to sit down if you

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,470
have never heard of advanced custom

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,810
blocks before now

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,260
I mean advanced custom fields sorry

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,410
who's who's never heard of the plug-in

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,690
before now okay cool

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,610
who has never used it sit down if you

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,610
have never used the plug-in all right

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:26,240
okay cool

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:30,440
sit down if you have never used the pro

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,940
version of advanced custom fields all

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,450
right Ellie will be very disappointed in

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,250
all of you sitting down for those people

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,460
that are left standing I'm very curious

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:45,800
to know sit down if you have never used

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,140
the flexible content field yeah all

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,000
right okay so I'm gonna be talking to

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,470
about ten people in the room which is

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,840
just amazing but like we said we're

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,430
talking about now and what is really so

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,040
special about now so you can all sit

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,100
down okay and now I guess is really a

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,690
big time of change for WordPress and in

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,970
order to talk about now we might just

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,369
need to quickly breeze through a little

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,170
bit about before because I noticed at

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,700
the start of you know today when we're

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,140
going around the room there's a lot of

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,150
new people here they're new to word

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,530
camps they're new to WordPress and maybe

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,890
they just don't actually understand what

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,900
the fuss is all about but way back we

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,870
had this thing here this is called the

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,459
classic editor now that lovely big white

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,769
rectangle that you see up there where

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,660
you could paint your masterpiece all

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,980
right but pretty soon people realize

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,450
that that wasn't enough to make the

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,400
website of their dreams and people

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,560
wanted to do more and so they turn to

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,660
this stuff called meta fields but the

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,420
built-in user interface for meta fields

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,769
is quite frankly very poor all right

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,890
don't tell the court devs that but it's

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,440
horrible and so people realize this I

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,950
started making custom ones and doing all

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,560
of that and that's where we meet a CF or

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,080
advance custom fields it is a plug-in

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,570
that takes the that weird kind of like

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,970
text key value store thing that we just

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,489
saw before and turns it into these rich

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,810
user interfaces that make putting in

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,370
like customized content

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,450
an absolute dream so we have things

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,910
there like you can see it's a color

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,200
field as date pickers there's even just

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,880
you know plain stuff like text and

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,459
paragraphs and we can do things like

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,200
require content to be set or we can

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,110
dynamically hide and show sections

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,030
depending on values that people pick and

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,099
in general it's just like you know a

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,959
much much better experience for this

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,910
kind of you know custom stuff that we

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,489
might want to do in the admin so for me

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,709
as a novice web developer discovering

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,200
ACF made me feel all of a sudden like a

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,900
wordpress superhero all right all of a

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,150
sudden I went from kind of like fiddling

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,819
around with things in the WYSIWYG to

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,010
being able to design these really cool

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,709
editing experiences in the admin using

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,420
the GUI the ACF provides and I managed

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,890
to bumble my way through some templating

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,319
code and all of that kind of stuff and

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,660
get it out put on the front end and all

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,370
of a sudden it was just amazing

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,739
I could do whatever I wanted with

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,930
WordPress my clients loved it I was

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,670
having a good time and in general life

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,530
was just pretty good you know we got

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,350
some new fields over time I didn't

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,450
really go back I kept using ACF however

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,430
when the flexible content field was

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,310
released that kind of really changed

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,910
everything so what this enabled you to

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,910
do was to define these groups of fields

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,320
called layouts so it'd be a group of you

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,330
know you could place more fields into a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,070
layout and then you put a collection of

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,720
layouts together into this flexible

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,340
content field and when someone's

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
authoring that content they just come in

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,910
and they go I would like to put some

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,530
text in and then they see the text

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,820
fields and I would like to put the call

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,680
out in and then they see the fields

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,200
related to the call-out and you could

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,590
just build up your page using these flex

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,600
content fields and pretty soon myself

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,490
and a lot of other people from what I

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,760
can gather online realized all of the

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,340
power that this presents and they pretty

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,360
much stopped using the regular WordPress

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,010
content entirely

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,930
we just started hiding it or turning it

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,660
off or whatever and doing everything in

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,669
this flex content way because also when

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,260
it came to templating it was so much

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,120
easier right we could write this like

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,680
basically there's one statement and

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,110
almost have one template for the whole

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,529
website so what this does is it just

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,329
fine

00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,149
what the layout name is called and it

00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,739
loads a template file called that layout

00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,029
name and so all I need to do is

00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:32,429
basically just go through and make sure

00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,559
that the names match up and all of a

00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:36,509
sudden now I can develop my websites in

00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,539
a totally different way so rather than

00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:44,849
relying on fixed pages now we started to

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:46,469
build modular blocks and also all of a

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,199
sudden you know now clients can just

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:51,179
come in and add more it used to be when

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,229
I first started using custom fields for

00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:54,929
example you'd have to get the

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,789
specifications of a website like totally

00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,989
on point because if the you know the

00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,129
client would come back and you'd be just

00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,449
about to launch the website they'd go oh

00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,759
yeah we need another paragraph or an

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,379
image right here okay I'll go put in

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,599
more fields I'll go change the template

00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,169
code but you can see here that you can

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,729
just add new ones in and that loop that

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,089
I showed you before will just kind of

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,269
like take all of that into account also

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,679
and this was a huge thing at the time

00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:22,499
vertical ordering of content stopped

00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,449
being a problem when we were using fixed

00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:26,789
fields we had to make sure that we got

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,739
the order right okay so if we wanted the

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,629
map you know to be before the contact

00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,399
form but after the paragraph or whatever

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,659
yet to make sure it was that way in the

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,249
template we had to make sure that

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,249
hopefully the fields lined up in the

00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:40,289
admin to or someone would get confused

00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:43,469
this now you can see you can just drag

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:46,349
and drop it around and it was really I

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:51,110
mean in my mind kind of the precursor to

00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:51,110
the modern browser that we have now

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,729
after discovering all of this I have to

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,109
say life was pretty good all of a sudden

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,359
were developing you know WordPress

00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:02,129
websites in this new way and we were

00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:04,469
happy you were productive it's fantastic

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:08,219
and then of course you know it's as

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:10,649
always time for change ok Project

00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,019
Gutenberg was announced you may hear me

00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,669
refer to Gutenberg or the block editor

00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,429
throughout this talk and they are the

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,809
same thing I apologize if I use one or

00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,209
the other at certain times but they're

00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,519
interchangeable but the block editor was

00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,199
announced and all the people like me who

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,369
were absolutely crazy about advanced

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,899
custom fields were very worried because

00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,610
I've gotta admit I don't I was not

00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,619
really a big fan of the classic editor

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,569
akai always losing any sleep over losing

00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,669
that

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,749
big rectangle apologies to the person

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:44,479
from tiny MCE who's here but what I

00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,300
missed is that I could change all of

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,849
this right like using the skills that I

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,619
had I had PHP skills and I had you know

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,029
HTML skills all that kind of I could

00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,219
change all of this stuff I knew the

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,020
actions I knew the hooks and I could

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,409
just turn it into a blank canvas where I

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,969
could put whatever I wanted and then it

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:04,969
comes out that now all of a sudden I've

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,800
got this and I don't have everything up

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,110
here that's all the react application

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,759
now you can see that it expands a little

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,959
bit but it's still not really enough for

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,469
like a whole content authoring

00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,639
experience and so you know we're all

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,139
just sitting there going like what are

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,699
we gonna do what's what's gonna happen

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,379
and I think that you know in general

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,749
like we were just really worried about

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,089
the change partially I think because

00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,769
we'd spent time building a system that

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,990
worked for us and we're always so

00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,149
protective of things that we have

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,919
created ourselves alright whenever

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,750
something new comes along we're always

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,089
just at a rush to be like nope I've

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,800
invested so much time into this that it

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,069
can't possibly get replaced it can't

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,779
they can't possibly be something better

00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:47,209
but it sort of turns out that I got to

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,759
have my cake and eat it too and so did a

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:53,600
lot of other people because since ACF

00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,000
pro version 5.8 or greater we can now

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,899
use like the same field interface to

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,920
create these custom blocks and once

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,300
again life was good so maybe you're just

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,430
sitting here wondering like why don't we

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,930
just make native blocks we have already

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,990
had some fantastic talks about that

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,139
today why don't we just replace flex

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,709
content with native blocks sometimes

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,959
honestly you can so I have made flexible

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,810
content fields in the past before that

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,420
just contain like a simple sort of

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,769
assortment of fields so we put a heading

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,660
block in there and we put like a

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,310
paragraph on in there and an image and a

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,949
YouTube and all that kind of stuff and

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,600
we just find that clients would often be

00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,790
able to use that still easier than the

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,380
classic editor something like that is

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,610
the perfect example to just get

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,199
straight-up replaced by the block editor

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,790
however for some of these other things

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,610
where we've created these really custom

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,100
experiences we still want to cut

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,250
demise the editor so we're gonna need

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,440
some way to do that one of the ways that

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,720
one of the reasons why I really like

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,250
using ACF blocks as opposed to native

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,220
blocks is we get full control of the

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,680
markup at render time I'm not saying

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,300
that is impossible with native blocks

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,060
it's just a lot easier with ACF blocks

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,680
and I think really the big thing the

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,240
really the big thing is why people don't

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,709
want to sort of get into native block

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,170
development is that they've like

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:20,440
perceive it as being a steep learning

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,200
curve I must say though it is getting

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,209
better we've seen some things like

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,410
rulers talk this morning I thought was

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,000
very interesting and they talked about

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,709
that he talked about the WP scripts

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,930
project how that's making it easier for

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,000
people to get into react development by

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,380
removing the hassles of managing your

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,410
build process and all that kind of stuff

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,329
but it's still well you know there's so

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,310
much good stuff there but it's still a

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,600
big change it's still a huge change

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,860
especially if you're not used to writing

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,779
modern JavaScript es5 or years next

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,160
react is different the paradigms of it

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,170
all are different you know there's just

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,990
there's a lot going on there and most of

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,940
us are busy man like I work for an

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,100
agency we are pumping out the websites

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,430
obviously you know we take time to make

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,240
sure it's done right but for they're

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,740
flying out the door and not everyone has

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,260
that luxury of just being out of drop

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,970
everything learn new stuff and then you

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,740
know pick up where they left off we have

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,480
so many legacy applications that we've

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,880
got to maintain and have solutions for

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
them and so I guess we're looking at all

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,089
right how can we progressively introduce

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,709
this or how can we start getting some of

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,920
the benefits of the block editor today

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,070
without completely changing everything

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,180
all right so hopefully now you're

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,160
starting to come around you might be

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,699
going well if I'm going to use this ACF

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,079
blocks thing am I getting a watered-down

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:40,029
experience am i you know is this like is

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,560
this block eight it's a light or

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,589
something like that because I'm using

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,910
this and for me I really feel like the

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:52,449
answer mostly is no so native blocks can

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,610
be static or dynamic and I really like

00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:58,240
that a CF blocks are all dynamic so a

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,220
static block when you save it that block

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,630
may define some additional HTML

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,440
something like that and that gets saved

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,390
into the

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,700
in the database if you change that

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,140
template you need to update the posts in

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,450
order to change the mark-up for me

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,100
that's a bit silly it's why I use

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,920
something like WordPress is to have an

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,390
abstraction over that so I really want

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,640
dynamic blocks where everything's

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,140
rendered server-side so that if I if the

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,620
client needs this to change across the

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,850
entire website right now it can for me

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,690
that's kind of like what I love about

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,670
using a CMS in general so the data is

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,640
decoupled from the design like I've been

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,160
talking about and I find for us that

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,230
makes our development a lot faster the

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,390
the portability or compatibility between

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,280
I guess our old solution and the new one

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,540
also makes our development a lot faster

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,560
and we're going to get into that in a

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,870
little bit as I mentioned ACF blocks are

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,180
registered using PHP so you'd do this

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,670
within a theme or a plugin and you don't

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,460
need to know any react or like you know

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,350
WP blocks JavaScript API any of that

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,880
stuff great stuff to check out if you

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,230
have the time but you don't need to know

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,640
any of it to use ACF blocks and finally

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm sure there would be some people who

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,710
are familiar with ACF that are wondering

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,380
how the data is saved so it's not saved

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,570
in post meta like it used to be for

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,880
things that are within ACF blocks it's

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,520
actually saved as a JSON literal object

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,800
in a HTML comment because I guess this

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,720
is like the gutenberg compatible way but

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,240
it is important to note that like it's a

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,940
really great replacement for say if you

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,850
were using flex content or other fields

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,130
to replace the content of your wordpress

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,350
post however if you were using meta

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,140
fields i guess as more what i would say

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,350
is like actual meta if it was more

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,060
something that you would query by as an

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,250
example or sort by or like something

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,490
like that or is just like an additional

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,780
piece of information that you want to be

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,730
able to you know fetch out the database

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,740
separately then maybe it's still best

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,880
suited like actually being a meta field

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,220
and living in that drawer down the

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,540
bottom and in that case probably weren't

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,070
really considering like you know flex

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,500
content or anything like that in the

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,540
first place either so it doesn't mean

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,260
that post meta or you know regular meta

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,730
fields have completely gone away okay so

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,290
what's the learning curve like how much

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,339
time we talking here we're all

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,470
see people if you already know about

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,029
using flex content and have like built

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,680
some templates for that or something

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,870
like that you only need to learn one new

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,670
function you should be Adam basically

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,680
walk out of this talk and just go do it

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,959
because it's that simple

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,120
if you've ever written a child theme

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,040
theme or plugin then it will be really

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,540
easy for you to pick up because you have

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,730
some knowledge of I guess what it means

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,079
to edit PHP within WordPress maybe where

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,540
some of the files live and things like

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,579
that if you've never done any of that

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,800
before if you've never used advanced

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,899
custom fields or have never edited the

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,970
PHP of your WordPress website then it

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,380
may be a little bit harder but all of

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,300
that difficulty is going to come from

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,269
the more general concepts surrounding

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,130
those things and not ACF blocks in and

00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,810
of itself it's just that I guess you

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,329
have probably a little bit further to

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,160
get up the ladder before you can use it

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,360
with the same fluency as you know people

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,730
that are used to doing that kind of

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,459
stuff

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:16,300
all right so we on board should we get

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:19,750
into it I will not be sacrificing to the

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,190
live coding gods today so I apologize so

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,660
when it's gonna have a lot of code on

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,980
screen and that kind of stuff but here's

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,540
here's where we really I guess start

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,970
getting into it so the usual disclaimers

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,389
you're making edits use a child theme

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,790
edit and test locally do not test will

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,440
make changes in production to your Shore

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,750
better yet have a testing and deployment

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,220
process do you want to know more about

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,550
that Rachel I've had a couple of beers

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,730
I'll be yelling it at you later tonight

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,760
okay so it all comes down to this one

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,279
function was introduced in ACF five

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,430
eight it's called ACF register block

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,010
type args is variable there it takes an

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,620
associative array of arguments and they

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,750
define I guess how our block behaves and

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,240
you know what we what we need to do to

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,829
get it all up and running so let's check

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,720
it out on the left here we're going to

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,480
have the arguments and then on the right

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,980
this is the block selector in the block

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,300
editor okay so this is like a piece of

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,500
the block editor where you go and you

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,240
click on the plus and it's like a new

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,740
block and I'm just going to use that to

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,110
maybe highlight how some of the choices

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,730
that we make here affect what we see I

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,069
now I just realized there's actually a

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,060
slide missing from this but I'm using a

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,070
fictional example

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,630
as we all need to do for demos my

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,440
fictional example was a website about

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,090
dogs called good boys hope you all enjoy

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,250
it and so we're building a featured dog

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,270
oblak alright let's just let's get

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,820
around it so the name is the unique name

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,130
for this particular block so this it's

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,960
like an ID for your block it should be

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,480
globally unique you cannot have two

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,680
blocks that exist with the same name so

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
you may want to prefix it with like a

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,940
namespace you could do like my theme

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,950
slash whatever but in general it's like

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,290
think of it as like a slug or an ID

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,830
avoid spaces I wouldn't capitalize that

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,340
kind of stuff is just going to get messy

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,900
alright the title so the title is what's

00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,910
displayed up here it's like the human

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,410
readable nice name of the block and you

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,510
can see it highlighted over there in the

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,220
in the block selector make it

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,280
translatable that's what those sort of

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,750
you know wrapper tags there are and then

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,670
we also have the description which is

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,520
not shown on this particular part of the

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,070
editor it's in the top right when you're

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,570
actually editing the block itself we

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,980
have the category blocks belong in

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,330
different categories and as you go

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,490
through the block selector they're all

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,730
separated out into the categories so

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,680
I've put this one in embeds you get to

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,730
define an icon for your block and it

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,350
will take a like the name of a - icon

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,580
you can also pass it an array if you

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,470
want to specify foreground and

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,870
background color for that icon you want

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,550
it to look a bit snazzy or if you really

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,890
want to get fancy you can also pass it a

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,540
string that is an SVG so you can just

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,210
pass an SVG straight in there for a

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,460
custom icon and finally we have some

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,590
keywords which help when we're searching

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,330
so now with the block editor and people

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,460
adding additional plugins and us making

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,750
custom blocks we could end up with so

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,800
many blocks that it's really hard for

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,310
the client to find the one that they're

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,930
looking for

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,510
so then being out to find it through

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,880
search is actually an important thing so

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,620
we can define synonyms here which may

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,710
not be the actual thing in our name but

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,240
you know what they can find it by so

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,820
this kind of stuff is really all like

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,650
meta about the block you know it defines

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,060
like what it's called and you know what

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,970
the title is what category it's in all

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,640
of that kind of stuff the next few

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,730
things are I guess like the real meat of

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,050
it all so the first thing is render

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,880
template

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,610
so we passed this in if you want to use

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,640
render template you pass it in the full

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,500
path to a PHP file and this is where

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,210
your markup and everything will live

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,190
this is where you'll make your you know

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,140
the field calls and all of that kind of

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,720
stuff and do your regular ACF thing and

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:03,550
so you just pass it in a string that

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,770
goes there you also or not also you have

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:09,160
the option of instead providing a

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:12,730
callback so you can provide a function

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,650
name as a string you can provide a class

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,180
method if that's what you want or you

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,460
could provide just like an anonymous

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,900
function I think even like an in vocable

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,360
object I'm pretty sure anything that

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:26,350
satisfies like PHP scorable type will

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,060
work and so you know that way if you

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,170
maybe have some conditional logic you

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,970
want to run before you select the

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,060
template or something like that it can

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,280
it can happen if you define both for

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,270
some reason you just want to overachieve

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,700
render callback will actually take

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,580
precedence so that one will get run and

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,640
your template won't be loaded styles and

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,970
scripts are very similar so we can just

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,800
pass it in like you know something you

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,760
know just a style sheet or a Java Script

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,760
what am I trying to say a Java Script

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,410
file and they're both optional you don't

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,000
need to load additional styles for your

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,100
block but if you do they'll get loaded

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,420
in both the admin and on the front end

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,170
and they will do so on an as-needed

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,220
basis so if the block isn't on the page

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,220
that style sheet doesn't get loaded

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,980
javascript and CSS has been more

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,980
complicated these days and so sometimes

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,080
we might end up in situations where you

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,580
know a style sheet or a Java Script or

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,290
something like that has dependencies and

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,570
WordPress has a great system for handing

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,370
this already however this kind of like

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,340
simple quick interface that we've seen

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,750
above is just meant for you know getting

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,730
up and running really quick or really

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,160
simple scenarios if you need to also

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,260
like make sure that your assets

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,990
dependencies get loaded call the regular

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,120
sort of like wordpress WP and cue script

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,580
or whatever functions then you can do so

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,900
within one of these sorry I've got to go

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,200
through all over again that's just not

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,200
going to work

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:54,049
through one of like the callback so

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,570
again you pass in any of the callback

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,730
types and then from there you can call

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,360
the regular WordPress script and all

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,509
that kind of stuff no I can't just skip

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:09,529
past this but you know hopefully now

00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:11,149
you'll really remember it okay cool so

00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,279
like I was saying it's very similar to

00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:15,139
render callback takes any callable type

00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,679
let's actually look at some code for

00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:21,049
making a block now so as I mentioned

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,480
good boys our example is dogs because

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,730
what's more wholesome this is minimum

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,830
viable block registration basically that

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,480
we're doing here firstly we're going to

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,490
check if the function that we want

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,049
exists so this lets us know if we're

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,190
using a version of advanced custom

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,080
fields greater than 5.8 also notice that

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,269
we're we're doing our add action call to

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,789
like hook in registration function we're

00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:45,440
putting that on a CF in it so this is

00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,929
kind of nice because it means that it

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,990
won't run unless advanced custom fields

00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:53,779
is also active and and you know like

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,559
running so rather than putting on like

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:58,820
wordpress in yet or something like that

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,590
this is our register block type call

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,409
it's basically the same things that I've

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,230
been showing you on the screen there and

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,580
this is a Minimum Viable template

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,350
technically you don't need this stuff

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,990
but it's a good idea to just pop that in

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,899
there this deals with some common

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,639
guttenberg kind of class names and

00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,080
attributes that the editor passes

00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,649
through to you to deal with things like

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,570
layouts and alignments so you don't need

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,580
that but it's a good idea to have that

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,570
for all the blocks and as far as the

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:33,559
actual block goes I can there we are you

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,700
can see down the bottom it's just a very

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,409
static thing at the moment I've just

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,389
written hello well there I'm not calling

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:40,490
any of my dynamic data it's just hello

00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:42,769
well like we just want to get something

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,509
showing in the admin so as a final step

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,999
we just need to attach a field group to

00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:50,600
it now when we go to the field group

00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:54,220
drop-down we have block as a you know

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:58,330
location option and we can set that and

00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:00,649
from there we should be good so

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,879
found it and now you can see like the

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,710
hello world just output because we're

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,120
not using the data and I've set one

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,769
custom field on this block over on the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,500
side and it just lets me pick like a

00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:10,580
custom post alright so again we're just

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,590
we're just trying to get up and running

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,789
but you can see the field over here and

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,559
the output up there so let's just skip

00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,629
forward a little bit past the kind of

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,100
hello world thing and get to the point

00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:24,139
where you know I've actually defined

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,059
some markup and some styles for that

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:30,710
block so that's just you do that like

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,389
you would regular HTML and CSS and so

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,519
now I guess this is more of like the

00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:37,070
finished block so you can come in here

00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,740
and pop it in come over here and select

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,659
a dog and then I go fetch that post and

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,610
use that post to then dynamically

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,190
populate the data of that block and you

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:50,059
can see that as we update and pick a new

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:52,070
dog the content changes so this is like

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,480
a live sort of like preview in the admin

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,860
which is definitely something that we

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,840
weren't really able to do with with

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,269
flexible content so and once more life

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,259
is good

00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:05,120
we're we're kind of back to where we

00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:07,669
were before and now we have this almost

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,750
like supercharged flexible content block

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:12,980
in the block editor so it's like you

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,730
know we've got our old kind of like

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,009
customized

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,139
interfaces back and we've got some cool

00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:22,789
new tricks like I showed you there with

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:24,799
preview mode so you can also click over

00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:28,070
to edit mode which just renders out the

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,690
regular ACF fields in the editor there

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,580
this can be really good if you have lots

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,440
of fields or you have like old field

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,240
groups that you know have multiple

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,669
columns of fields in them and and you

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,809
know like complex things like that

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,419
having them over in the sidebar over

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,870
here might not work for you so you know

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:46,639
you can just use the edit mode there

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,909
just really quickly if you are someone

00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,960
that has a lot of flex content I don't

00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,820
think we're going to run through this

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,230
just for time reasons but go check out

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,870
the slides when the posted online this

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,809
is like a three minute speed run of me

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:03,230
converting a Flex content block into an

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:06,169
ACF block takes that long so go check

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,850
that out we'll skip past that tips for

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,139
breaking up flexible content as well

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,789
this might be better off to come and

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,230
revisit this at another time but

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:15,320
effectively there are lots of ways

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,419
that you can get your field definitions

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,280
out of advanced custom fields you can

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,890
use their local JSON feature to like

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,440
save them as JSON files or you can use

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,770
the PHP export and you could quite

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,809
easily using a text editor cut up those

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,190
files to them like take out the sub

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,840
field groups and define them as their

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,809
own top level field groups we've done

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,010
that in extreme cases worst case remake

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,360
the fields it will probably take you

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:43,700
like 10-15 minutes ok so just going a

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,870
little bit deeper here's some lesser

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,990
used arguments of this stuff of register

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,900
block type and it can do some cool stuff

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,370
so post types we pass that an array of

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,320
post types that we want this block to

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,650
support and it will be hidden on all

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,299
other post types alignment we can set

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,190
the default alignment when it first gets

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,780
loaded into the editor and same with

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,309
mode we can choose if we want it to come

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,620
into preview mode or if we want it to

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:11,990
come into edit mode and then finally

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,790
with this supports array we can also

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,470
turn some of these things on or off or

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,080
like limit the options of them a little

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,990
bit so down here in a line I've chosen

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,510
that I want to support the full and wide

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,820
alignments I could also pass back false

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,440
and turn off alignments all together and

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,080
that little toolbar would then disappear

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,910
from the gutenberg block same with mode

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,049
you can disable preview mode if you

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,690
don't think it's really going to work

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,340
for your field group or maybe you know

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,809
they're kind of like thing that you're

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,000
outputting on the front end is way too

00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,380
hectic to having the admin so you just

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,720
want to turn it off and just only see

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,070
the fields multiple is the cool one you

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,179
can set it to false and then they can

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,440
only put one of those blocks into the

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,640
content which i think is like really

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,040
neat ok so now you've kind of seen what

00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,570
it takes to get you know a block up and

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,590
running and there might be some

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,169
developers in the audience that are

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,669
considering taking that step but those

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:06,290
people that haven't really worked with

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,280
the block editor before I'm a

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,990
particularly those that are coming from

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,240
a PHP background I guess here's some

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,549
bonus tips for just dipping your toes in

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,530
the water a little bit this is a really

00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,210
cool blog post on synchronizing color

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,000
palettes between the guttenberg color

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,470
picker and ACS again there's a link in

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,010
here so when the slides get posted

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,260
online come and check it out

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,020
it's pretty easy to disable custom

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,520
colors and font sizes in Guttenberg and

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,760
if you're building websites for clients

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,290
I'd almost highly recommend that you do

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,460
so it's just a couple of add themed

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,320
support calls you can get rid of them

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,299
and you can also using a couple of other

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,710
filters you can define your custom color

00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,000
palette and you can define your custom

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,380
text sizes and all of that kind of stuff

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,299
have some really nice consistency

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,020
throughout you can filter the available

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,309
blocks again it's just another filter

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,870
you can do things in there like test

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:57,700
what the current post type is all that

00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,990
kind of stuff make sure you don't filter

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,260
out your own custom blocks that you've

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,299
just spent all this time setting up and

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,970
you can also add your own custom block

00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,950
categories using PHP if that's something

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,840
that you want to do so again another

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,120
filter and the documentation for this is

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,750
on the kind of developer Doc's and

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,280
everything finally if you're a big flex

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,230
content user you may have discovered a

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,419
project called timber does anyone here

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:27,190
use timber can I get like any hands and

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:29,290
yeah there's dozens of us anyway

00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,880
I love timber like I really love

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,340
building WordPress websites using this

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,280
framework called timber and it gives you

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,110
an object orientated interface into you

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,150
know WordPress introduces some kind of

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,850
polymorphism to your templates and

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,070
WordPress objects and it lets you use a

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,830
temper a templating language called twig

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,230
which I'm a huge fan of but if you want

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,880
to render your blocks using timber and

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,559
twig here's pretty much how you get it

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,440
done this is your render callback that

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,020
will handle you for any block as long as

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,100
a file of the same name exists within

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,299
like you know views such blocks and yeah

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,200
that'll just kind of like pass in

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:10,559
context than any arcs applied to it and

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:14,440
this is just the same sort of template

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,390
that has been edited to now kind of

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,000
contain twig tags and all that kind of

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,340
stuff this is just to show the

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,809
difference to the one before but in

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,549
reality you would probably actually

00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,720
break it up into subcomponents because

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,730
that's kind of the whole idea of using

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,080
something like tweak so this is a little

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,510
bit more complex might look a little bit

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,799
more foreign but in the time that we've

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,809
created this one block we've also

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,270
created three reusable components that

00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,280
we can then I guess combine in other

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,750
so you know we've been talking a little

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,100
bit about components on the front end

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,960
and how it's great to have these

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,670
discrete things that are reusable and

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,460
kind of have like an API in terms of

00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,800
okay we pass this in and we get this out

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,420
you can use like language templating

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,570
languages like twig you can even make

00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,550
the same thing in PHP if you really want

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,110
and that whole concept I think still has

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,120
a lot of value on the server side as

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,680
well not just the front-end it's great

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,990
to have these little template parts that

00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,910
have an own API and so you can do things

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,590
like adapt them you know you can make it

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,480
so that you can just pass in a post or

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,620
you can pass in custom params and kind

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,390
of get the same result anyway finally if

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,090
you're really nuts and I'm coming up to

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,640
the edge of my time sort of here you can

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,820
look at defining your blocks and your

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,200
register block calls as class instances

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm not going to go too deep into this

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,500
because I feel like if you're doing this

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,030
you probably nuts and you have a very

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,590
opinionated way about how you would do

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,620
it and you're gonna disagree with my way

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,850
okay but you can do things like extend a

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,530
base class that handles all the

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,360
registration for you or you could use

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,430
like a service class or like manager

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,810
class to sort of register them you can

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,130
do nice things when you sort of been

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,870
within the PHP environment like

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,240
dynamically detect if the template files

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,100
or scripts exist and then cue them and

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,630
if you're doing that kind of stuff I

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,740
highly recommend that you use an auto

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,910
loader because it makes the entire

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,920
process so much more fun alright so just

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,300
breathe you through all of that really

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,040
heavy stuff there but I just want to say

00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,960
like it's definitely a new time for

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,710
WordPress it's a big time of change and

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,950
change can often be uncomfortable you

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,480
know it's it's always hard and it always

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,130
I guess is one of those things where we

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,900
struggle to feel like maybe these skills

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,960
that we've invested all this time into

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,310
aren't worth anything anymore and I

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,780
guess today I really just wanted to

00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,330
present some things to you and show you

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,670
that we can still do some like really

00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,210
amazing things just using I guess the

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:34,180
WordPress skills that we already have

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:37,030
you know we can embrace the block editor

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,570
without retooling and retraining using

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:44,470
ACF blocks and I mean yeah I just like

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,060
to say that really like you shouldn't

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,070
let the technology kind of hold you back

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,299
if you want to learn react learn react

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,190
if you already know PHP and your comp

00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,349
there you can do some incredible stuff I

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,499
just encourage you to get out there and

00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,809
build an experiment and try it all out

00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:01,639
so special thanks to our organizing team

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:02,779
and our sponsors without them I wouldn't

00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:05,539
be able to stand here and talk to you

00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:07,459
all this afternoon I'd also like to

00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,959
thank Elliot from advanced custom fields

00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,639
for graciously giving me some of his

00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:13,729
time on the lead up to this talk to help

00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,649
me prepare I would like to thank frame

00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:16,969
creative the people that I work for for

00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:19,669
our flaming out here to speak to you all

00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:21,049
today we're a branding and digital

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:25,639
agency based in Adelaide South Australia

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:27,559
I am Alex James Bishop you can find me

00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:30,849
on Twitter there I kind of just post

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,849
programming memes and that's about it

00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,749
and remember life is good it is the best

00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:37,399
time now to be a web developer that

00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:38,959
there ever has been there's so much

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,459
stuff out there and the level of choice

00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:42,799
that we have can feel a bit crushing or

00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,509
overwhelming at times but honestly it's

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,129
all this great stuff you can take it or

00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,239
leave it and it's up to us I guess to

00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,499
decide where we go from here

00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:50,649
so thank you very much for having me

00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,649
today

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,750
[Music]

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,130
we have time for any questions five

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:07,870
minutes all right all right

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:11,340
hit me we've got one up there apologies

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,340
in advance if the answer is I don't know

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,380
have you ever tried to convert like

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,750
write a script that will convert your

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,280
flexible content builder into the new

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,800
blocks that you create like is there

00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,190
like you've taken a website you've

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:30,250
created all exactly the same blocks

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:33,100
converted it no to be honest like that's

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:36,130
that's really something that would have

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,710
absolutely been my jam about six months

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,160
ago I've kind of turned over a new leaf

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:45,540
recently of like not spending 20 hours

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,070
automating a task that takes 30 minutes

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,720
so I've sort of like been actively

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,730
trying to stop myself from doing that

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,590
kind of stuff because I used to over

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,510
optimize on the autumn ization front I

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,430
think that it definitely would be

00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,860
possible you just need to decide what

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,600
format you want to work with them in and

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,630
my recommendation for that would

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,240
probably be the JSON format so have your

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,940
theme like how do you know about the

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,560
JSON format for us yep yep yep so I

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,330
would just work with them because like

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,430
you can just really easy pass him into

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,470
an associative array and I think that it

00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:20,290
would be very easy then to split out

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,450
those each of those like layouts just

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,040
off into its own group thin and you just

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,350
need to like work out a way of coming up

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,270
with I guess like unique group names and

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,920
stuff like that because they need to be

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,330
globally unique you could literally just

00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,700
like generate them on a time stamp or

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,530
something like that so yeah would would

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,000
be definitely something you can do if

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,850
you wanted to do that would be a great

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,020
WP CLI a kind of like thing I think that

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,760
would be like the ideal kind of

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,860
framework within which you'd build

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,460
something like that but I haven't

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,460
personally done it

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:55,759
sinking a beer at the after party can I

00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:58,549
ask one more question yeah sure so it's

00:34:55,759 --> 00:35:00,829
not too wrong to believe you would turn

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:05,029
off everything in Gutenberg and just

00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:07,940
build your own blocks you can but I

00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:10,640
actually that was my initial reaction I

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,740
think that some of the things that you

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,480
get in Gutenberg just out the box are

00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,890
almost like kind of kind of better like

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,559
particularly when it comes to text

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,349
content so I actually really like having

00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,269
individual list and paragraph and all of

00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,650
those kind of like blocks even like some

00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:28,009
of the stuff like button and heading I

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,799
leave all of those on and I don't I try

00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:33,220
not to make a CF blocks anymore that use

00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:36,230
the ACF WYSIWYG field because like where

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,119
we're instantiating like tiny MCE within

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,400
this whole like block editor and it just

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,990
gets really JavaScript heavy so you

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,029
could do that particular if you're

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,400
building from scratch but I actually I

00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,480
really do enjoy the the text editing

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,339
experience of a lot of the Gutenberg

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,119
stuff I just build blocks for custom

00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:56,660
things okay cool

00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,710
yep so maybe this was implied before but

00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,180
when you were talking about hey there's

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,759
this one function you need to learn to

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,440
register an ACF block yeah and there's

00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,200
certain arguments you pass to that those

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,099
arguments looks very familiar are they

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,839
identical to registering a regular block

00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:15,740
because it looked a lot like the same

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,930
ones I believe it's very similar but no

00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:22,029
it's not actually quite the same okay

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,029
that is Elliot

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:31,730
yeah yeah they're the same but yeah my

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,050
understanding is like like some of the

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,560
supports and stuff is a direct

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:39,710
correlation supports I think definitely

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,839
lines up with support but yeah yes so

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,900
the arguments that you can pass into the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,420
PHP function exactly the same as the

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,920
native JavaScript props but with a

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,500
little bit of sugar sprinkled on top so

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,640
you get some extra stuff in there like

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:59,599
the callback and the assets JavaScript

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,579
and CSS type stuff yeah yeah which is

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,250
called so it means that any time that

00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:09,400
the Gutenberg developers add new

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:11,839
properties to the JavaScript API the PHP

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,220
ACF equivalent will just inherit that as

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,910
well all right awesome

00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,910
any other questions

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:31,240
howdy what some examples of like custom

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:34,030
blocks that you've built for people okay

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,560
well I'm not on really like my computer

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,380
or anything so I can't sort of like show

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,130
you but what we typically really try and

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,350
do is similar to what you saw with the

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,650
featured dog block is we try and make

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:50,260
really simple interfaces that generally

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,000
do like pretty complex things under the

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,330
hood so that way the client can crop

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,600
them really easily we have a stock set

00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,920
that we pretty much install on like any

00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,600
any kind of website some of them aren't

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,800
needed anymore now that the plugins and

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,570
stuff of caught up so we used to have

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,830
like a gravity forms one and all of that

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:09,130
kind of stuff because we just needed it

00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:11,590
but now they've got their own however

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,000
like yeah a lot of the time we find

00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,610
ourselves again and again and again like

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,500
just having this thing called a combo

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,970
block or a feature block or whatever I'm

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,320
pretty sure everyone knows we would have

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,150
seen something like what I'm talking

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,470
about there's an image there's a title

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,000
there's some text and there's one or

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,410
more buttons and it's laid out in a

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
number of different ways but those items

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,770
are like always there we pretty much put

00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,350
one of those on every website because

00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,850
like everyone wants one and then a lot

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,410
of the time after that we're looking at

00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,640
things like post grids and related

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,350
objects and stuff so they might just

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,180
pick a category and we'll automatically

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:43,450
pull in like you know nine posts from

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:47,140
that beyond that like getting into more

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,790
complex things I feel graphs so using

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,560
like a JavaScript front-end like

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,180
graphing library and just people

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,480
supplying some like numbers and

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,880
parameters in ACF and then we pass that

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,310
into like you know I was using like apex

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,290
charts I think with you and you know

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,950
outputting like a dynamic animated graph

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,740
on the front end even like we are

00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,870
starting to build things more with the

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,890
kind of view frameworks I'm like like

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,690
view reactants felt and so a lot of the

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,150
time yeah we'll just like create a block

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,190
that defines any of the component like

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,990
props or params and then just passes

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,780
them straight through into it as a JSON

00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:28,600
object so yeah so you can do you can do

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,710
pretty much anything but we find a lot

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,870
of the time our clients have pretty

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,520
similar need

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,320
the content and then we just build

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,520
blocks where you know where they have

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,290
unique needs so we are we done timewise

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,460
done yeah awesome thank you so much for

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,460
having me today guys telex

00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,460
