[Applause]

00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,100
[Music]

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
good morning or trying it's done very

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,490
quickly I know we all really want to go

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,740
and get coffee and mourn see morning see

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,740
but I remember on my demo I put like

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,029
demo on it full disclosure I forgot

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,330
about that until like a couple of days

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,070
ago so to keep true of that I don't know

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,769
if anyone's really notice but we've got

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,920
these lovely people over here doing sign

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:40,739
language so I like to know what is a

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:57,770
sign language for good morning so sorry

00:00:40,739 --> 00:01:05,369
for the delay so is this good and

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:08,610
morning morning so good morning and is

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,040
this for clapping yep so let's try this

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,729
for today instead of clapping let's just

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,830
do this

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:19,710
yep and if I go too fast or if I just go

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,240
masse the OP topic just do that as well

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:29,270
it'll make it a lot easier but let's get

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,710
actually to the torch so there we go

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,920
hi if you're not heard I'm sure main

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,200
light drink coffee pretty much I can't

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,150
start my day without of coffee if you

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,930
see me without coffee I'm normally very

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,850
alone and very angry also love being

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,780
outdoors that's why I lovely put a pod

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,700
of me on a rock once again there's just

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,070
me it's like rarely went or parts not

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,119
actually hiking I just took a bit too

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:00,450
much effort also if you don't follow me

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:05,369
tp9 on any social platform that's my

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,719
username so today I'm sorry I probably

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,920
should have skipped it before I did but

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,050
today I'm going to talk about five

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,750
things I wish I knew back when I started

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,670
to actually do development those are

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,960
quite a while ago it's

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,750
there's a lot of stuff out which I knew

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,000
the main one is imposter syndrome it is

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,550
real guys like it's something that I

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,050
didn't notice I had until I started

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,970
attending WordPress meetups

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,180
and actually talking people in community

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,460
where like I look at what I was doing it

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,470
I never actually really knew that I

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,450
thought that I didn't know what I was

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,450
doing for those that don't know what

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,610
impostor syndrome is here's the nice

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,680
definition of it the psychological

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,870
pattern in which an individual doubts

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,660
their accomplishments and has a

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,300
persistent internalized fear of being

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,170
exposed as a fraud that's it in a

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,450
nutshell

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,560
I feel it's something that most of us

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,750
have had in our early stages even maybe

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,000
him today that we have all thought that

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,060
we were an imposter and scared that

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,770
somebody was going to say hey you're not

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,690
a real developer or hey you're doing

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:20,050
this and you're not really looking at

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:22,870
yeah but it's something I feel that we

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,880
should as community just embrace where

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,710
even if we're a page builder if we're

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,100
doing a project we're all developers in

00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,710
a way we shouldn't be looking at it as

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,450
once a developer oh this person's using

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,940
this tech that's not what signed our

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,800
dues this person is using this tech I'm

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,870
not going to use that text that person

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,610
is not a developer web I think Google

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,580
day actually had a campaign for it

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,620
saying like am i a real developer or

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,480
saying if anyone remembers what the

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,240
hashtag was shouted outs

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,590
as I just forgot about it even I put on

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:04,900
my notes but impostor syndrome is real

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:08,230
number two don't do cheap projects

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,340
they're not worth it they're gonna cause

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,710
you a lot more pain than they actually

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,700
worth doing especially when you're doing

00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,200
sites for under a thousand it's gonna

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,359
cause a lot more problems than it is

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,360
actually good I remember back when I

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,370
started I was in high school so $300

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,620
seemed like a lot to me back then but

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,320
these days that looking

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,550
got it destroyed me as I was doing work

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,470
for like 20 30 days and getting paid

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,660
only a couple hundred dollars for that

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,729
work where now I'm looking at it

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,650
and I'm getting paid for the same

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,889
quality of work in the same level of

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:53,979
time about two three thousand dollars

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:56,860
more an hour contracts need them even

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,080
for small day projects have a contract

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,600
have a piece of paper that actually says

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,550
what time you I deliver it what you're

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,350
going to deliver with and everything

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,990
that you need to deliver to that client

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,389
even if it's just a simple piece of

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,630
paper saying I will deliver this website

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,150
with this function with this plugin

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,370
delivery at this time and I'll post it

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,160
on this platform having it all

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,530
documented and signed has a really good

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,030
open relationship with your client so

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,620
then you know handing over the project

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,900
and going with the claimant coming back

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,530
to you saying hey I thought I was gonna

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,229
get this well having a contract means

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,530
that you can go back and say well no

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:41,050
we'd agreed on this terms conditions we

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:49,000
agreed on this spec which agreed upon

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:52,900
this plugin plus well second last one is

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,750
a work/life balance it is very important

00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:02,169
to actually have the ability to not just

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:04,960
work and work and work and work and then

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:10,330
sleep the next morning you work work

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,380
work and sleep which let's be honest

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,710
here who has that form of lifestyle we

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:21,820
got a couple I think some people are too

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,520
scared to put their hands up but it is

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,620
plain that I've looked back at at only

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,699
very recently and worked out that I had

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,340
really no life other than work and other

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,650
small commitments where it's ain't that

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,229
I now look at a saint that I want to

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,120
have a lot more better achievement and a

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:50,669
lot more

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:52,580
ummph in doing last one as I want to

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:57,180
have a lot of time for questions that I

00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:00,240
don't know if I'll have but we have to

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,630
have the big like inspirational thing so

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,910
dream big don't limit yourself to what

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,020
you can do right now limit yourself to

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,780
what you can do next

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,970
no matter what you do each project have

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,900
going into it increasing what you can do

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,889
by 10%

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,260
so if you are building a website what is

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,530
the next step today take you to the next

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,720
level what is the small maybe like

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,940
single extra 30 minutes can you add to

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,870
that project that can improve you as a

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,370
developer and then do it even if it

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,440
doesn't work it doesn't actually go into

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,669
the final product you're going to

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,090
eventually just keep building yourself

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:42,180
up to become the next level of developer

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:48,030
or next achievement all most eyes hit

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:52,740
the mic sorry audio tech guys but I just

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:54,389
had to have that slide that's and I want

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,729
to have some more time for questions so

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,340
I can actually have a better gauge Minh

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,630
any questions or any feelings that

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,630
anyone has in the crowd

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:06,870
anything they want to talk about even

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,080
just personal statements that's open for

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,080
anything

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,700
you talked about work-life balance yeah

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,820
what do you think is a good work-life

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,700
balance well I like to limit myself

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,910
about eight hours a day at work and then

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,910
I like to somewhat just switch off so

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,820
after eight hours even if it's I work in

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,919
the day of relaxing the day working at

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,770
night I like to have the ability so that

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,200
even though I'm a freelancer I still

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,070
have the ability to go home and fully

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,810
switch off where I know a lot of times I

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,040
can only just to be just freelancer I

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:57,220
would go to work go home go to work go

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,880
home and we went on at home I've run my

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,280
laptops replying emails or finishing

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,160
that projects or studying for the next

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,110
projects well then you've just pretty

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,120
much like you turn off for a little bit

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,030
but you're only turning off by like 30

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,850
or so saying so YC is always having it

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,230
so that you are actually working even

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,500
though you're a freelancer so you get

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,820
that like office like 9:00 to 5:00

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,660
feeling if that makes sense

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,660
any other questions

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:38,200
I think it's great that you underscore

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
needing a contract yep

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,480
can you dig into that a little further

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,790
how do you actually manage that process

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,220
of getting them to sign and what do you

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,050
have in the contract because I know that

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,550
part's pretty difficult and sometimes

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,620
they actually come back with their own

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,070
contract or want to strike pieces of

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,740
yours out yeah so pretty much it varies

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,590
on what your project is but I like to

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,290
have a very uniform concept where my

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,090
contract start with a brief description

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,670
of what the company is and what we

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,340
actually do and then pretty much I mean

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,460
just define what the project is like

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,890
what platform what's the website or

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,420
what's the app and pretty much to find

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,760
that and then actually go in and scope

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,190
out the project so I might have for

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,230
example if it's a website I might have

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,840
these are the pages I'm going to do

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,570
these are what's on me on those pages

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,780
I'm gonna be supplying the content the

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,180
images you have to supply this or this

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,660
and then pretty much I mean say it's

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:44,260
gonna take me X amount of hours it's

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,390
this much per hour and then pretty much

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,580
I have it like as a blanket statement I

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,340
get two reviews and then after that

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,680
you've got to pay for an Allie rate and

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,360
then I pretty much have a real fun that

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,390
you pretty much sign it when you do

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,100
deposit so that pretty much as soon as

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,170
they receive it most of the time they

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,520
sign it where occasionally I've got a

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,890
couple that sign it a couple of days

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,710
after but I mean pretty good most of my

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,000
clients are happy to sign it and a lot

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,590
of the routine ones just sign it by

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,300
default I think the laws are quick yep

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,300
one icers bottle second

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,920
firstly thank you for your presentation

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,680
it was really really helpful with the

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,350
tips ere going back to the imposter

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,360
syndrome topic when you're going to do

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,280
that next big thing say something like a

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,570
speaking presentation or a really big

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,270
project because there anything you've

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,800
done before how do you practically deal

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,410
with the imposter syndrome that can

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,780
creep up in those circumstances yeah so

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,490
that's a very good question as it's been

00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,530
that I really do not know about it's

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,830
like a couple months ago but pretty much

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,140
the way I look at it now is if I feel I

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,740
can like if I can feel I can do it I'd

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,740
do it

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,030
but if I know I can't do it I can't do

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,950
it which I'll explain a lot more but

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,440
pretty much this sums up what battosai

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,570
but pretty much where I look fully at it

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,750
is like you've got those things where

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:15,200
like if your invoice like compute any a

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,300
proposal to Apple that you think that's

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,390
a lot lower chance to it but you like

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,580
going to a cafe meaning for client a lot

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,740
of that stuff I feel is just you just

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,680
have to go into it knowing that you are

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,420
the best that you can be I go into it

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,670
knowing that even though if you don't

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,010
think it to go into it thinking that you

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,280
are the next level like you are a top

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,830
developer and just embrace it like don't

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,040
think about it and I just do it in a way

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:46,610
it's like propose like contract or is

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,330
that project just go in and do it and if

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,160
it goes down it goes down which is if

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:56,780
you ever want to learn how to face

00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:00,260
rejection do door-to-door sales it helps

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:02,570
a lot like we laugh but who really adds

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,470
the door actually sizes that sign up

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,430
with that like I did it for two weeks

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,600
that's how I want to have a face

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:15,320
rejection by yeah so pretty much just go

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,010
for it and aim to be your best and if

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:24,620
they reject you move on to the next one

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:27,520
we can take one more question how about

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,520
something at the very back

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,330
no okay

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,450
and I was one at the very very back

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:40,120
anything so I'm just wanting you guys to

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,530
get some real light exercise here I feel

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:49,060
like we've only been going up like the

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:52,660
fourth or fifth row so he quoted a

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,970
figure of a thousand dollars as the sort

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,650
of the bottom limit us to sort of

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,530
projects you do how did you come up with

00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,230
that figure well pretty much I works it

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,540
out as what would I want to wake up so

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,750
if I knew I was working something how

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,190
much would I want to wake up to do so if

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,910
it's a project that's three hundred

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,470
dollars

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,330
I know that's going to take me 15

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,520
minutes so I'm not really gonna go wake

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,400
up and go yeah I'm in for this I want to

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,850
go and make this blog articles today or

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,380
I want to add a photo to this webpage

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,080
where if I do it not a thousand dollars

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,690
the clients gonna come out to me and say

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,790
okay yep I'm gonna add this this this to

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,490
it just so that it makes it worth its

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,560
while a bit more as also so thousand

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,230
dollars is more of a limit on my alley

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,000
so you can't just hire me for 15 minutes

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,650
you gotta hire me for an hour if that

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,420
answers your question

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:51,790
I yeah well those are some great and

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,620
useful tips and I can definitely second

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,390
the hall getting a contract sign for

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,460
absolutely everything you do so that's

00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,660
that's a key takeaway and so thank you

00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,590
very much man please give them a warm

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,969
thank you

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,969
