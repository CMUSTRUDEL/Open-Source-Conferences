well when I was practicing this at 11:30

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,880
p.m. last night staring at a wall it

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,410
doesn't do any justice to what you

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,920
actually get when you're standing in

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,390
front of an audience so yeah this is a

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,550
big deal for me I've been wanting to

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,769
speak at WordCamp for for quite a few

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,130
years I yeah I got him this time because

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,309
somebody called in sick

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,989
so that was cool yeah it made them see

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,750
it 19 for now so yeah this is this is

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,010
kind of a big deal for me cuz I've this

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,670
is the first time I've actually spoken

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,289
out a word camp so it's kind of kind of

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,289
cool thank you

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,739
now I'm very mindful of time and I tend

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,879
to attend to just waffle I've been told

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,270
that a lot so I should just move along

00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:11,030
and beautiful timekeepers here so

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,310
they'll keep me on track anyway okay so

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,729
welcome to my presentation I am going to

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,430
be going through for the next 30 to 35

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,420
minutes hopefully less than that but um

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,210
we'll see I'm gonna take you through ten

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,920
things that you know your WordPress

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,329
website can do that you may not know it

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,210
can do now we know that WordPress is

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:39,229
quite a fantastic content management

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,979
system he can build beautiful websites

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:47,659
with it but there are plugins that can

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:52,079
extend the functionality of your website

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:54,930
beyond your your mind can blow your mind

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,390
so you know there's two objectives that

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,390
I have for this presentation the first

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,299
one is to blow your mind and to get you

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,350
to the point of saying ah well you can

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,209
do that cool and the second thing is see

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,940
this see that little rocket up on the

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,460
screen yeah yeah we got to get that

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,030
rocket

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,860
to the planet okay and if you look

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,980
closely though if you look closely at

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,720
the rocket you'll see a little WordPress

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,910
logo okay

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,610
that's a flag so we're going to get the

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,740
rocket to the planet and pitch the flag

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,200
on the planet okay that's the second

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:38,260
objective so does that sound all right

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,040
yes thank you all right let's get into

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,190
this shall we

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,740
so Who am I hi I'm Paul I do three

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,870
things try and keep things simple I'm a

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,850
dad and stuff like that but this is my

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,660
business II sort of thing

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,420
so yeah like Ingrid said I run a company

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,790
called Gold Coast business websites

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,620
where we build WordPress websites teach

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,250
people how to build them and manage them

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:11,800
and and we also do ad hoc and all that

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:14,680
sort of jazz with websites so look out

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,220
for another brand called WP Genie which

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,010
is a wordpress website care service so

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,900
I've just an extended that on and it's

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,080
the typical you know you sign up for a

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:31,060
monthly subscription and you get wishes

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,950
so you get additional tasks with the

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,830
particular plans that you sign up with

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:40,510
it's pretty neat check it out the other

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:45,250
thing I do is I organize and co-host the

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:49,510
WordPress Gold Coast meetup so if you

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,150
are in Southport on the Gold Coast next

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,300
Thursday and you're just driving down

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,040
Ferry Road at around 6:00 p.m. then

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,740
popping to the tavern the Ferry Road

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,330
tavern where you can join other

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,550
WordPress like-minded people and learn

00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,010
more about your WordPress website I

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,160
highly recommend you come along to that

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,170
so yeah that that runs on the very last

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,810
Thursday of every month and it's

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:22,180
completely free thank goodness for our

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,400
our sponsors kinetics WP engine and WP

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,720
Australia couldn't do it without those

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,240
guys so

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,910
those guys thank you all right so that's

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,340
me let's get cracking Joey into the ten

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,190
things that your website can do that

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,550
maybe you didn't know that it could yeah

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:42,370
so with any one to ten we always start

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,660
with number on one right so let's have

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,520
let's have some fun

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,860
all right number one turn your website

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,560
into a proposal generating machine all

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,250
right who here hands up

00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:02,680
be honest do you guys who sends

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:05,200
proposals out using PDFs right cool and

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,630
look there's nothing wrong with that but

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,520
I encourage you to have a look at maybe

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,550
just changing your mindset a little bit

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,730
and changing the way that you send your

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,940
proposals and I was doing the exact same

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:26,110
thing up until the end of last year and

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:30,730
I started utilizing my website as a way

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,830
to send my proposals so there's a couple

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,110
of ways that you can do this and the

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,700
first way that you can do this is to

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,160
install WP proposals it's a plugin it's

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,340
totally free it's totally awesome and

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,040
what that does is it puts a a new post

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,650
type into your dashboard menu as you can

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,020
see on the menu on the arrow and that

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,560
allows you to create proposals on your

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,050
website so just like adding a page or a

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,090
post you can then create a proposal and

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,870
then you fill out all the fields like

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,419
the customer name and all the all the

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,360
ingredients of what you're offering in

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,120
your proposal and then you hit publish

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,030
and then that sends an email to the

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,130
client with a link that they click on

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:23,110
and then they get taken to your website

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,060
with the details of the proposal now

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,890
Knox the header and the footer out so it

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:33,130
just creates a nice a nice sort of you

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,830
know like a nice template and then they

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,690
can and then the customer can just put

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:43,070
their email in at the bottom to accept

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:46,010
and we're done very easy so I used to

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,870
send up like PDFs and then you know the

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,030
clients would have to you know get it on

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,950
their phones and they'll read through it

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,950
and then I have to pinch and zoom in to

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,630
have a look and and then they had to

00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,600
they had to actually print off the last

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,540
page of the proposal to sign the

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,340
agreement so to print it off sign it and

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,530
then they'll take a photo or they'll

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,460
scan it in and then send it back to me

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,080
and that that takes a lot of time so I

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,890
haven't your proposal system on your

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,730
website can really save time and I must

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,440
say that since I integrated this into my

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,160
website at the beginning of this year

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,000
I've had at least I'm being probably

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,610
quite humble here but yeah probably

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,600
about a 50 percent uptake in my proposal

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:38,720
acceptance just by changing that one

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,180
little thing so I'm not using this

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,730
plugin I've done it a different way I've

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,770
gotten a couple of other plugins to help

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:50,000
me build my own custom post type and

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,810
this is what mine looks this is what

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,560
mine looks like so on the left you can

00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:01,550
see that yeah I've just got a proposal

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:05,960
post type and then it's just like adding

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,450
a normal post editor to your to website

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,330
and then I've got some fields to a

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,120
client name and proposal day the total

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,400
investment and I keep mine really simple

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,360
I just got bullet points lists of what's

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,740
included in the proposal and that's all

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,380
I have and then what I use is I use a

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:32,599
page builder called Elementor to build

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:34,550
out the template and then I I use a

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:39,440
couple of plugins to build the custom

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:41,570
post type and one of them's called

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,700
custom post type UI which creates the

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,820
custom post type which creates the

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,690
proposal post type and then I use

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,280
advanced custom fields Pro to use to

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:57,320
build the the few

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,600
and then I yeah I integrate the the

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,160
short codes from the advanced custom

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
fields and then I put that on the

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,580
template and then well uh it just it all

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,310
works really well I won't go into great

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,590
detail about it but but I tell you what

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,990
it is amazing I've spoken to my clients

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,960
and they love it they love getting these

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,600
proposals and as I said I get I've

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,300
gotten a pretty big increase in in the

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,780
accepting rate so that's number one

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,480
let's move on to number two all right

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,080
this is pretty cool personalized website

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,650
content so there's nothing greater than

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,400
hearing our own name we know that right

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:42,440
so we love the sound of our own name so

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:47,000
when you so with this idea is that you

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,120
you can create content and directed to

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,440
specific people so you can personalize

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,140
it so you can say hi Bob or hi John or

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,680
whatever whatever the person's name is

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,540
and there's a really cool plug-in that

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,440
allows you to do this really really

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:12,320
easily and it is called the get Perriman

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,320
alright and what that does is allows you

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,060
to create a shortcut well it creates a

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,810
shortcode for you and then you just pop

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,010
that in to where you want it to go so

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,780
you might have you know happy birthday

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:31,970
Mary something like that or happy

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:36,260
birthday and then the shortcode then

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,720
what you do is you create a well you

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,100
create a link just like you see on the

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,520
example there so you've got your website

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,740
address the page name and then you've

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,680
got a query string does everybody know

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,020
what a query string is all right well

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,240
that's a query string so you've got

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,770
where it's got the the question mark and

00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,320
then priam name equals john so what you

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,709
do is if the person that you're sending

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,870
the personalized content to is called

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:09,920
john then you would send them that

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,770
link okay in its entirety or if it's

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Michelle you send it to a you changed

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:19,450
John to Michelle wait whatever so then

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:27,740
what you can do is you can create things

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:29,360
like this so ever since so this is how

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,350
this is what I've done I've created a

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,510
template using Elementor I've got a

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,850
happy birthday the words and then I've

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,970
got the short code which you saw on the

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,250
previous slide I've got that next to

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:47,870
next happy birthday and then I've put my

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:50,390
little message and then I send the the

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,150
query string that I showed you there so

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,930
my what made my website address and the

00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:59,000
page name and then the question mark

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,540
prayer name equals Michelle as you can

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,089
see on there and then basically the

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,070
query string takes the name from the

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:10,150
query string and replaces the shortcode

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:21,170
with the name that's in the query string

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:25,520
so it's really sorry I you could yeah I

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,990
mean that absolutely yeah you can do

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,900
definitely do that you can have video

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,970
you can like that that that background

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,089
of the balloons is just a YouTube video

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:39,800
and I've just got that on loop so it's

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:43,940
pretty easy um so that's number two

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,190
let's move on to number three all right

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,560
anybody who is interested in the

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:53,709
blockchain technology what chain anybody

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,260
yeah anybody heard of it or not have it

00:12:53,709 --> 00:13:01,790
yeah yeah cool awesome yeah it's a it's

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,720
a big thing it's a big thing so yeah

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,430
number three your blobs on the

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,339
blockchain

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:14,630
has anybody heard of steam it no oh

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:18,440
hello whoa cool yeah she's a plant no

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,000
yeah statement is a is a website where

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,160
you can

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,250
create content and get paid for that

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,070
content from the community so we call

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:32,339
these micro payments and and you get

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:37,850
paid in cryptocurrency other also known

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:40,500
as steam dollars I think yes steam it so

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,970
the the idea of this is that you would

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,380
you will create blog posts on your

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,709
website right you're going to do that

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,459
anyway so with this particular plug-in

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:52,769
called steam press you can set it up so

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:56,690
that when you post a blog on your

00:13:52,769 --> 00:14:01,470
website it can automatically be pushed

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:03,449
to your steam it account and then if you

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,420
know people really like your content and

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,540
they love it they'll upvote you by

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,699
paying you in cryptocurrency and then

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,850
you can take that cryptocurrency put it

00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:18,089
on an exchange sell it and actually make

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,930
money from your blogging content pretty

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:24,620
cool huh pretty cool so you've heard of

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,620
medium.com

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,680
so it's similar to that

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,329
where you know you put a lot of post up

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,040
and and people clap I think it is or so

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:38,010
yeah it's basically the same as that but

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,829
you get actually paid for your content

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,500
so steam press allows you to blog on

00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:47,040
your website and it then forwards that

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,560
blog over to your steam it account and

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,449
then puts the blog over there where you

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,410
can potentially get paid which is pretty

00:14:51,449 --> 00:15:00,440
neat so you need a steam it account I

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,180
just install the steam press plug-in and

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,819
then you configure the settings to the

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,949
blog content to then steam it and I'll

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:10,230
show you a screenshot what I mean here

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:12,360
so there's your blog and then you got

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:17,100
like it puts a little option there to

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:22,170
then tick box to then forward to steam

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:24,600
it and that's it so it does there's

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,290
roughly around about 1.4 million active

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,189
members on steam mint something like

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,100
that yeah

00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:32,990
so it's pretty cool and it's growing all

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,090
right sorry

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,090
let's move on number four marketing

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:41,030
automation in your dashboard this is

00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:48,280
pretty awesome anybody heard of

00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:49,730
groundhog groundhog grand holiday yeah

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Bill Murray

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:56,030
loved that movie well groundhog is a

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,460
it's a fairly new plugin I guess sort of

00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:03,080
new ish on the scene but it allows you

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:07,190
to set up email funnels directly in your

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:10,220
dashboard so similar to what you know

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,470
active campaign and those other like get

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,150
drip and all those other third-party

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:22,820
services that you can use to create more

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:26,660
complex funnels or email marketing

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,490
sequences or automation groundhog

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,720
basically simplifies all that and

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,790
creates its own and user interface

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,830
within your dashboard and then you can

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,240
set up triggers and all sorts of stuff

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:46,430
that send out emails when somebody does

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:49,730
something so you can manage and store

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,540
your own list so you're not you know at

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,070
the mercy of the third-party services so

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,800
you can actually control your own lists

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:01,970
completely and have control a complete

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,370
ownership over it and you can save money

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,820
on using external third-party services

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,870
as well

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:11,600
now of course groundhog is you know very

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,250
simple if you need more complex stuff

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,709
then you would go and use active

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,570
campaign or the other be the bigger sort

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,450
of players but if you're just starting

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,580
out and you just want to you know tip

00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,230
dip your toe into automation or if

00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,240
you've got like an e-commerce site and

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,630
you've just started out then this is a

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,060
good starting round because it works

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,510
well with all major e-commerce platforms

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:39,650
as well like we're commerce and and

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:41,930
others as well so this is a screenshot

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,810
of just an example funnel that you can

00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,580
set up so this one here is just

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,690
basically you know you create a form

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:56,210
and then when somebody fills out the

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:58,610
form an email is then sent so they might

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,880
feel out of form to download something

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:06,350
your value like a PDF or whatever and

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,769
then you trigger that and you send them

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:14,570
the email with the PDF and then you can

00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:17,149
set up other actions to to deal with

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,559
that that person so then if you so if

00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:19,820
you have an email that gets sent to them

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,549
and they say you know click on this

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,070
email takes them back to the website a

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,029
landing page and this is here's your

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,399
download link and then you can actually

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:35,539
then trigger another another email like

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:37,039
two days later using this system to say

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,409
hey you know what do you think of the

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,480
PDF and then you can set up other

00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,480
triggers like say another two days like

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,429
later after that send another email so

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,380
it's pretty cool

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:53,720
I encourage you to check it out if you

00:18:48,380 --> 00:19:00,730
want to sort of get into this yes it's

00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:02,090
free chapel do letters get it now

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,029
download it

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,909
yeah it's on the WordPress repository so

00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,889
yes it is pretty neat area again it is

00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,260
limited there are limitations to it so

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:14,179
just be just beware that all right

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,340
number five any movement okay

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,159
make your forms work harder for you

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:26,269
people all right what do I mean by this

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:30,649
so this there's so many times that I've

00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:33,559
come along websites and you know when

00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:35,630
I'm looking at a website and I and my

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,510
clients asked me to you know look over

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,179
it one of the big things I check is does

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,210
the contact form work that's a really

00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:49,340
important thing because sometimes they

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:50,990
don't work they stop working so but most

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,500
of the time I find that when I'm when

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,539
I'm testing these contact forms I put in

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,110
my details you know hit the send button

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:02,780
and then like a little message comes up

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,590
underneath that says your form is

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:11,510

all right let's move on number six crack

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:13,580
DIY atlantean sales pages there is no

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,820
excuse for you to not use your WordPress

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,610
way

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:21,490
site to house your landing pages you

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,470
know yes you can go and use other

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,340
services which I will not name you know

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:30,440
who I'm talking about you know you know

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,740
but there is no excuse that you can't

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,840
use your own website to house your own

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,390
landing pages in fact you could create a

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,540
custom post type using custom post type

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:44,060
UI and advanced custom fields and you

00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,920
can well you wouldn't may not even need

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,420
to use that but you could create your

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,120
own landing pages within your own site

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,970
so then you can direct traffic to your

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,640
site to your landing pages

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,460
and there are a host of plugins that

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:05,480
will help you build beautiful landing

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:09,980
pages such as elemental Brizzy site

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,800
origin beaver builder and can anybody

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:20,510
guess what the next one is Oh Gutenberg

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:22,280
yes so yeah there's no excuse there's an

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:26,060
example of probably a really poorly

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,510
badly designed landing page that is one

00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,700
of mine sorry um but the important thing

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:37,990
is when they fill out that form guess

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:41,120
what happens they go to a Thank You page

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,860
exactly no little message that comes up

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,070
saying your form is submitted

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,650

headless WordPress now this is getting a

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,900
little bit technical but I read a really

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:50,530
great comment recently about this and

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,390
somebody wrote the comment on somebody

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,760
trying to explain what headless is and

00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,140
then some of you wrote I'm still trying

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,600
to get my head around

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,360
headless WordPress I thought was quite

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,460
funny and I actually quite I kind of

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,980
feel the same I've just thrown this

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,179
slide in to this presentation to scare

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,670
the bejeebers out of me

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:13,900
and try and explain a kind of complex

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,550
sort of thing in a simple way so you do

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,870
this to challenge yourself when you're a

00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:22,630
speaker so anyway anybody know what

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,550
headless WordPress is yeah some yeah

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,980
cool did you guys want to come down and

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,990
explain that

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,390
no damn it I'll pay you

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,030
I've got some money no okay let's have a

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,860
go this so you know how WordPress is a

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,270
custom management system yeah for a

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,240
content management system

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,670
yeah CMS you know like it creates

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,550
content you can put blog posts and pages

00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,290
and all that sort of stuff and and then

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,830
it displays all that content on the

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:53,320
front end yeah so like the website well

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:56,050
with headless it's basically stripping

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,890
out the front end and they call it

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:02,800
decoupling or decouple so you decoupling

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:05,530
the backend or the content management

00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,330
system part of WordPress and you're

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,720
removing and stripping out the front-end

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:14,260
component okay how am i doing so far

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:20,430
with this guys I don't all right sort of

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:22,780
ish yeah okay thanks vote of confidence

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:28,840
just put up like the five minute one if

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:31,900
you want so essentially anybody heard of

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,450
this thing the REST API it was

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,030
introduced in you know WordPress 4.4

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,940
back in 2015 it's pretty cool it's

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,610
pretty awesome allows developers to be

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,760
able to you know get and push and post

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,500
content from the WordPress ecosystem or

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,890
the content management system and push

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,620
it to other applications other

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,110
applications such as react or Gatsby

00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:00,490
I've just thrown these in because they

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:03,310
sound really awesome but yeah and

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,140
basically so essentially your your

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,920
housing the content on your WordPress

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,380
site and then you're creating

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,710
application like a web app or maybe a

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,920
mobile app which is basically pulling in

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,400
or the WordPress component is pushing

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,650
the content to then live on that other

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,890
application and there's some benefits of

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:29,140
this and that is faster load speeds

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,930
because the application that's sitting

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,340
over here that's getting the data from

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:39,850
WordPress that's not having to read a

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:43,360
database or fetch anything from a dad

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:46,600
thank you and it's it's essentially then

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,220
that the contents just there which has

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,860
been fetched from the content management

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,200
system so how am I going with this guys

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,540
headless guys yeah cool

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,220
thank you so you get fast loads of its

00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,730
and of course you have a lot more

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,540
flexibility and control for developers

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,960
which is pretty neat

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:08,140
and if the CMS goes down which is

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,530
WordPress then the application stays up

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:16,240
it's not dependent on the content

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:18,450
management system of WordPress so the so

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,630
that's a really good thing as well I

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:27,430
would say yeah so if WordPress goes down

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,440
you go fix that and then yeah so how do

00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:33,970
I go guys with the headless stuff was

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,030
that all right yeah cool again just go

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:41,190
on Google like I did at midnight last

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:43,570
night for the the 101 hundreds of time

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:48,700
you know what the heck is headless

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:51,610
WordPress now also if you are around the

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:55,030
port macquarie area next week I think

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,110
it's does it Thursday next week yes the

00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,870
port macquarie

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,870
meetup group they're going to be doing a

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,710
thing on this where you can take your

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,910
laptop and you can follow along it's

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,930
totally cool and they're gonna be doing

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:12,160
a headless with Gatsby is that right

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,150
cool

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,310
yeah talk to Robi he he runs it yeah

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,580
cool so if you're in the in the

00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,560
neighborhood of port macquarie and go go

00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,690
to the the meetup and you'll learn more

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,930
about this okay I'm running out of time

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:32,260
so the next one is or the ninth one is

00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:36,100
go static with Hardy Press anybody heard

00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:39,850
of Hardy press cool nice so how do

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:43,180
presses a service kind of like a hosting

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:45,820
platform where you can go and build your

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:49,120
website on that platform under like a

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,510
staging site are similar to cloud ways

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,340
if you familiar with cloud ways so you

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,410
build your site

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,410
and then you would press a button in the

00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:01,680
dashboard that says publish site and

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:05,510
then what hearty press does is it does

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:11,700
it's magic does this thing where it

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:17,760
converts the website into a HTML based

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,620
site so we all know that HTML websites

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,990
load faster because they don't fetch

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,330
anything from the database so all the

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,070
content is there and that's what howdy

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,830
press does and then what it does is it

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:32,160
puts it up on its CDN content delivery

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:35,400
network and they've got 30 servers

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,790
around the globe which then deliver your

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,300
website to it so the the main benefits

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,810
of hearty press is that load speeds

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,460
really fast

00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:49,140
they say up to 10 times faster the

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,390
website is secure there's zero

00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,650
maintenance you don't need to do any

00:31:51,390 --> 00:32:01,500
plug-in or theme updates that puts my

00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:03,930
business WP genie out of business but

00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,820
you know but you gotta sort of note as

00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,150
well that it doesn't support dynamic

00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,770
websites that have you know shopping

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,170
carts and all that sort of stuff so it

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,860
doesn't support all kinds of sites if

00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,180
it's just a brochure site very simple

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,220
then you can put it up on hardy press

00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,760
and you can get it loading faster and

00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,280
you don't have to worry about it and

00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:30,210
also it only supports contact form 7 as

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:34,230
well for the contact forms sorry gravity

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,000
form lovers so yeah so that's Heidi

00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,090
press all right let's go number 10 the

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,210
last one offer affiliation this is a

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,350
very simple often missed opportunity

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,710
here does everybody know what

00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:51,570
affiliation is no best spell affiliation

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:53,550
right yeah anyway doesn't matter

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,160
so essentially if you've got if you're

00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:58,650
running a science or if you're running

00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,280
some sort of service where people come

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,250
to the website and buy stuff then why

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,580
not why not create an affiliation an

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,980
affiliate program

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,100
on your website so if you want to drive

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,990
starting to drive traffic to your site

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,910
and your your felt you're in the market

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,860
you you know you're trying to get your

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,930
website out there then this is a great

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,850
way because you can then you know tell

buy and hey you get a commission a

00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:46,870
commission so this is really cool

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,030
so there's a plug-in called affiliates

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,830
manager where you can install that it's

00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,290
free there's a whole ton of other

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:56,350
premium add-ons and stuff that you can

00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:59,610
pay for but you can get set up pretty

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,650
easily with this particular plugin so

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,710
now the benefits of course great for

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:08,260
generating leads for e-commerce websites

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:12,190
allows you to monetarily reward those

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,310
who refer you or refer customers to you

00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,470
and it's a fully self managed system so

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,840
you don't have to do anything you can

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:23,230
just send people a link and say hey sign

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,320
up and it all just works and then they

00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:29,080
can go and create a URL that then they

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:35,610
can send out to their to their friends

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,610
and stuff and yeah and that's it woo

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:45,819
so we we got the rocket to the planet

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,429
and you can see it yeah we've got the

00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:51,159
flag well done guys well done we got

00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,799
there okay we've got time for a couple

00:34:51,159 --> 00:35:07,480
of questions do we have some questions

00:34:52,799 --> 00:35:09,670
one up the back here that fun just got a

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,530
question on that WP proposal thing you

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,030
showed as you showed us WP proposal but

00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,450
then you quickly went on to say you made

00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:21,720
your own yeah why why did you not use WP

00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:24,849
proposal because I yeah WP proposal

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,650
didn't really do what I wanted to do so

00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:30,789
I didn't really explain that you know on

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,619
my proposal system because on on the WP

00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,170
proposal system when you send the link

00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:37,569
you have all the information there that

00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,630
you add into the the fields of that

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:44,049
plug-in and then at the bottom it's just

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,460
a system email field that they have to

00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:48,910
put in their email address to then

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,180
accept the proposal but I didn't want

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:55,059
that I wanted an actual forum there with

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:57,039
upsell opportunity and also a signature

00:35:55,059 --> 00:36:00,490
field there so I'm using gravity forms

00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:03,099
on mine so I just want to extend it a

00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:06,490
little bit more which WP proposals

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,839
didn't do for me so but you know if

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,690
you're just starting out and you know

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,539
you're wanting to get away from doing

00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,279
the PDF stuff then WP proposals is a

00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,670
great option to start with but then

00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:20,559
you'll find you may find that it limits

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:23,220
you in some way did you find that you

00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,750
when you said your proposals got more

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,660
increased conversion do you think that

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,460
other people were using the same type of

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:37,119
software and you have been disadvantaged

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:38,319
because you're using PDFs so so we you

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,940
know if you were quoting against three

00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:41,880
other companies and the other two people

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,990
are using something like an online

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,200
quoting do you think you would

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:49,930
disadvantage because you weren't well I

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,059
just think that yeah it all came back to

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,690
the user experience and I did ask my

00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,210
clients

00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:57,880
as well who accepted the proposal and

00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,530
you know you have to ask questions to

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,040
customers to see if what you're doing is

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,930
working and one of the main key factors

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,180
in their decision-making was that they

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,839
they found me to be more professional

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:13,329
with that that process and they said

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,760
that they got PDF proposals from their

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:19,630
other companies but they found that they

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:24,099
you know they having the the technology

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:26,349
and and sort of seen may use utilizing

00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:29,619
the website to create these proposal

00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:31,810
systems it gave him another tick against

00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:35,710
those other companies that weren't doing

00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,510
that so so yeah that's actually a really

00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,880
good point many years ago I was told to

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,619
be your brand and that's actually the

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,349
hardest thing you can do if you're a web

00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,410
designer having being your brand and

00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:49,780
having a technology-based proposing a

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,000
proposal system it's just part of being

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,800
your brand there's lots of options out

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,530
there I use propose a Phi and it really

00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,760
does make a difference for conversions

00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,020
okay any other questions so as one other

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,710
one just behind you

00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:07,300
this gentleman here with WP proposal can

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,650
you set up several different proposals

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,760
on the one web site to do different jobs

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,099
like if you're doing websites and then

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,849
you're doing Google my business as a

00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:21,490
separate separate well you basically

00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:26,470
essentially just you just creating

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:28,420
another post so you know so yeah it's

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,329
free another person put a proposal on

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,470
each post yeah we just changed the

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:37,060
proposal type I guess yeah so just you

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,200
know if you're sending a proposal to a

00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,000
client that needs

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,339
I don't know google reviews then you

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,410
create a proposal for that and if you

00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:46,740
have another client that uses that wants

00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:50,470
a website you build another proposal for

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,290
specific to that sorry yeah yeah so you

00:38:50,470 --> 00:39:01,890
know I've got ten topics for your next

00:38:53,290 --> 00:39:01,890
meetups any other questions

00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,160
okay well I'd like you to and I'm

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,980
thinking Paul again for very very

insightful topic I love having a bit of

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:16,060
