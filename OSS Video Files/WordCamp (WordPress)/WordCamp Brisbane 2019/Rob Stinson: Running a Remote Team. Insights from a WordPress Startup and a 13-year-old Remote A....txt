[Applause]

00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,350
thanks Cameron and I module apologized

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,059
unlike the previous session I haven't

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,710
color-coordinated my slides with your

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,269
hair I hope that's okay

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,510
so yes today's session for me is about

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,340
running a remote team and hi I'm Rob

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,650
it's good to meet you all

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,960
I live up on the Sunshine Coast so I'm

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,390
about an hour and off from Brisbane if

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,820
you enjoyed one Elstad on the Sunshine

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,199
Coast if you don't come to the Sunshine

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,780
Coast it's a nice place to live it's a

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,059
great place had me living on the

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,410
Sunshine Coast has so much to do with

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,940
the fact of what we're talking about

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,460
today I've been working in a remote

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,460
environment I have a young family got

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,030
three kids I've got one wife I play

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,950
football on Fridays and yet as Cameron

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,809
said I'm I've sent in two different

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,140
spaces when it comes to working remote I

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,910
work in a very small remote team on the

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,469
Block lab team with Luke here and Ryan

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,480
who's around as well we're a team of

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,120
three I'm in Sunshine Coast Luke's

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,090
Brisbane and Ryan's in Mexico I also

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,320
worked for Forex company it's sort of a

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,140
family of a number of companies but

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,520
there's about 400 plus employees and

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,700
it's a hundred percent distributed and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,020
they've been doing it for 13 years so

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,540
across the company an incredible amount

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,759
of experience in a distributed remote

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,189
workforce made heaps of mistakes you

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,280
know and learnt a lot from it but in a

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,590
big way doing remote before it was cool

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,479
so I'm very privileged to have the

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,159
insight that I've had from the these

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,100
these companies so this is ex wpx MVPs

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,689
part of that X company group and to a

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,740
wordpress agency and we do a lot of

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,360
enterprise media very large media sort

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,040
of WordPress implementations we also

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,070
work with a lot of large technology

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
companies like Google and big commerce

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,600
helping bring their feature sets of

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
their you know external to WordPress

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
services and tools and products and

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,350
bring them into the WordPress ecosystem

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,299
and then like I said I'm on the Block

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,909
lab team as well that's a wordpress

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,759
plugin that makes custom blocks for

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,540
Gutenberg a lot a lot easier than it is

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,310
if you have to do it from scratch so

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,650
this is where we do their hands up part

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,780
of every presentation so please hands up

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,550
who would say they work for emotes ok

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,010
I'm keeping them up for me keep them up

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,220
nice and high I'm saying 50% so who's

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,290
been doing remote for more than one year

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:37,349
more than two years more than five years

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:48,480
I care we still got some up more than 10

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:49,349
years more than 12 13 all right you two

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,260
can come down and do the presentation

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,060
because you never bother me I mean

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,560
remote where we this is not a new thing

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,910
I don't have to spend a lot of time with

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,280
you today explaining what a remote work

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,760
or a distributive work force is it's not

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,040
a new thing the idea is not new and it's

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,390
been touted as an answer to so many

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
different things within business for a

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,900
long time

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,670
it's been trialed by many many many many

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,379
companies around the world and seemed

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,209
failure because you know remote doesn't

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,519
work we tried that and it just didn't

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,010
work so it's not a new thing but what I

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,420
want to do today is take you through

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,250
some things that I've observed and this

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,659
is not deeply scientific this is not

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,340
peer-reviewed this is my own personal

00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,959
observations and these little things

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,549
that I've seen like how that's

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,129
interesting that's cool I like how they

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,629
do that that seems to work really well

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,510
enough fosters something that works well

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,760
for a moat this isn't it this is

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,099
interesting in art this is always good

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,269
to see because return remote can

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,590
actually represent a whole bunch of

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,230
things and there's this thing called the

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,790
remote working scale one two five you

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,680
know office space which is just no

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,980
traditional office space but then

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,290
there's having work from home option

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,489
there's a remote team in a single time

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,349
zone or there's a remote team in

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,030
multiple time zones but then there's a

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,439
remote team with like you know the

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,909
digital nomads such as the people that

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,670
just sort of like hop and skip around

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,980
the world so there's very variations of

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,150
remote work and then even the differs

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,640
from difference between being a

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,799
distributed company and a remote company

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,989
the standard sort of definition at the

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,729
moment that I see is that a distributed

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,400
company means that there is no office

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,130
everyone in the organization works

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
remotely whereas you could have some

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,740
companies are remote

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,960
but they have a centralized office as

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,500
well so without but I've mentioned for

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,050
xwp and annex company is 100%

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,430
distributed so 400-plus company and

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,099
individuals in 30 plus countries and

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,139
there's no centralized office so like it

00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,520
can certainly work at scale as well like

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,650
we're doing it within a small threema

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,479
team of three a block lab it's that's

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:50,669
easier but it can work at scale as well

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,349
you know why remote is great for

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,759
business you know things like you know

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:54,840
there's we know this sort of stuff so

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,729
I'll go through this quickly but you

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,889
know you have wide access to it there's

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,740
no the talent pool greater diversity

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,960
when you go out of sort of like Geo you

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,000
know location restrictions you get a

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,099
greater access to different culture and

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,770
different perspectives you know which

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,400
gives you either perspective yet wider

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,319
market access when you're engaging in

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,360
different locations and different spaces

00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,099
because you are remote you actually it's

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,599
interesting the insights you have on

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,120
different marketplaces and different

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:28,789
audiences that you perhaps wouldn't get

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:32,729
otherwise this is an interesting one and

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:36,150
slightly opinionated may not be the case

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:39,060
every time but within remote team

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,789
members are assessed more on their work

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,530
than on other things like and and this

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,759
is a generalization of course but in the

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,509
office space someone comes into the

00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,849
office and their bosses like robbers on

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,710
time today he clocked in at 9:00 a.m. he

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:54,810
could he's always on time that's great

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,030
that's not really work but lady no it's

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,310
it's a diligence thing you know arriving

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,870
on time Rob's always at his desk that's

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,530
really really good or Rob's a really

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,300
happy

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,800
conversational guy whenever I run into

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,389
Rob by the water cool we have a quick

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,729
chat he's a really nice guy and those

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,080
things are all fine and that's really

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,539
really good but it's interesting if

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,330
you're thinking about work a team member

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,039
performance according to their work it's

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,569
interesting how much of those sort of

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,069
things can impact the way people are

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,259
assessed like I said this is a

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,860
generalization but within remote work it

00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:29,090
tends to be the the work seems to speak

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,440
for the work worker more often than not

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,690
if things are bad with a client I can't

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,159
come knocking on your door take that one

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,570
or leave it but that's nice they can

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,460
hunt you down on Facebook and Facebook

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,550
Ads talk

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,110
if they like but not hearing you know

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,250
Rob come and saw this out as you know

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,580
that's a nice thing and for business

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,530
you can certainly save dollars little

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,570
asterisks there because disclaimer you

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,640
may not pull the implement it done badly

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,710
and everything like that but I would say

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,340
from my experience of what I've seen

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,200
that that operationally done well remote

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,990
work and remote distributed workforce

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,940
for the business has operationally less

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,070
overheads and you know you could dig

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,320
into all the reasons how another time

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,920
but remote is great for the person as

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,480
well

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:20,510
commute is optional I have so we are

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,060
working for a client in Sydney and we

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,490
were down there the other week with xwp

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,020
and we're meeting with them they're

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,290
fantastic client I was talking to him

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,100
and one of the guys commutes two hours

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:37,760
each day each way so four hours total

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:40,430
every single day from the coast above

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,230
Sydney wherever that is sorry

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,880
Central Coast thank you thank you he's

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,620
on the train so I mean like I feel like

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,940
if using the car that's like a dead time

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,680
but he's on the train suite there's a

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,980
bit of stuff legged every single day

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,850
that's that's brutal you know you have

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,620
to be more control over your

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,960
environments you know if you've got your

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,550
office at home or elsewhere but you know

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,260
you can make your space your space this

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,060
you know and everyone has we have you

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,470
know different things that we like and

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,290
you know you're gonna control the space

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:09,020
that we work in and who actually said

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,910
that nine to five is a good idea it's

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,500
not necessarily a great idea for the

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,990
individual and within remote work we

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,190
tend to be able to facilitate variation

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,710
in time a bit more I work for silicon

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,290
you know in Silicon Valley in palm woods

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,940
rural Queensland that's a fantastic

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,800
thing about remote work is that you know

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,900
ten years ago is very difficult to

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,490
access the kind of opportunities I know

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,220
that I've been very privileged access

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,840
and I know others here as well you know

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,190
couldn't do that unless it was because

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,150
you know the companies that I work with

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,320
and for believe in facilitate remote you

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,960
know you can set the aircon to whatever

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,280
you want you can reheat that tuna

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,850
casserole for lunch and no one's going

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,209
to complain and once again

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,410
would say on average for the the person

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,089
you're gonna save dollars if you don't

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,310
have to catch a train for four hours a

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,259
day and if you don't have to live in a

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,459
city and living in cities fine if you

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,870
want to but if you don't have to live in

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,819
a city where you know cost of living is

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,130
higher you know there's opportunity to

00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:09,139
you know impact and personal budget and

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,970
stuff like that so remotes great we know

00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,440
that I love this quote here talent is

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,230
equally distributed around the world

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,089
that opportunity is not and I think

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,190
about that a lot and I know I'm very

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,170
privileged to live where I am and have

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,720
in you know connections to the people I

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,800
do I think of the incredible talented

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,990
people in the world around there that

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,660
don't have the privilege that I and many

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,980
of us have and I'm I think you know the

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,050
growth of remote and distributed

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,029
workforce in our industries helping to

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,190
give access its opportunity for so many

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,790
people I think that's a really cool

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:44,690
thing I want to say like two long dinner

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,459
ayi remote is great for me and people

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,720
have said I what you know your weapon

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,589
your weapon might oh you work from home

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,230
right well you work from your house and

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,610
yes okay sure but I I came across this

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,149
idea it was explained to me from a

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:03,350
colleague of mine Brennan that working

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,240
remote doesn't mean you just get to work

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,490
from your house if it means yet to work

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,079
from your home okay no this is a

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,410
distinction and there's difference and

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,860
what that difference is is that when you

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,689
work remote is you can choose your home

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,699
where your home is the town that you

00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:21,620
live in what you want to raise your kids

00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:24,279
where you want to be engaged with the

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,600
community and do things like that and

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,980
you know you don't even have to actually

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,509
work from your house to say that you can

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,970
work from your home so like I work from

00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,199
an office space downtown looks like a

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,160
five minute drive so it's not that far

00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,540
and I'm wrench it with a couple of

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,730
friends of mine so don't actually work

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,230
from my house but I would say I work

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,610
from my home and I've been able to

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,079
choose where my home is I've been able

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,850
to choose that I want my home to be on

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,740
the Sunshine Coast I grew up there as a

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,509
kid it's a great place I love a beaches

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:53,060
my family's around and the remote has

00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:56,240
allowed me to choose where my home is

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,670
and has enabled me to you know work from

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,680
my home and that's a really for me

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,120
ultimately the cross at all why is

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,890
remote great is you get

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,589
choose where your home is and then you

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:09,589
get to work from your home but anyway

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:12,710
remote is great so how can we do remote

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:15,050
great how do we do it great and I would

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,650
if I can wrap anything around all of

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,690
this

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,680
is that it is about culture and

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,940
community not rules and procedures if a

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
company was like are we gonna roll out

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,970
remote we've seen the figures and we can

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,890
see that we can reduce overheads by

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,630
fifteen percent in two years if we have

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,640
a if we convert you know thirty percent

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,510
of our workforce to remote so these are

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
the procedures that we're going to

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,990
implement that department that

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,160
department that department so three days

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,810
of what you know you know what I mean

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,960
like you know and they a map it all out

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,029
and they hand or over a how-to book a

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,740
set of policies and procedures to the

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:50,990
workforce and say all right execute that

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:54,110
and we're remote now that doesn't know

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,089
it doesn't work for me success in remote

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,460
and success in remote from what I've

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,080
seen within you know X company and in

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,210
the small teams that I've been involved

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,190
in is so much down to culture and

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,200
community so for anything that you

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,089
implement begin any other things only no

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,320
show today it should be through the

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,170
perspective of how can we build a

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,070
culture that is great for remote and

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,490
great for remote workers it's not just

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,959
about rules and procedures and also

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,370
remote is everyone's responsibility

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,230
whether you're a team of three are a

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,900
team of 500 and whether you're like the

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,160
CEO of a larger organization or you're

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,860
just one of the developers on the team

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,600
every or you're a team manager to some

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,000
degree like you're you're responsible

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,170
for making sure that you yourself and

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,820
the people around you have a great

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,950
remote experience yeah I've heard people

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,390
say oh yeah I did work at a remote work

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,700
in a company and I don't really want to

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,620
do it and it just sucked remote sucks it

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,750
doesn't work like well I gave me maybe

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,670
your remote experience was poorly but

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,500
you know you've got to facilitate

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,270
yourself you've got to set yourself and

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,180
accept and accept the responsibilities

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,880
of working and remote as well to be able

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,709
to have a good experience anyway so

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,850
these are Rob's six no farewells to

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,670
build a great remote culture and

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,760
community for dummies and number five

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,130
will melt your brain but we have one two

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
three four five six that we're going to

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,920
go through and these are all little

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,920
snippets of things that I've seen that

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,269
I've worked over the

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,920
over the years and first other

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:22,350
categories within communication who uses

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,990
if you're even if you're not in a remote

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,959
team do you guys use hands up please

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,959
view slack or an equivalent like okay

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,790
you know company message sort of forum

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,860
sort of thing one thing I would say is

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,449
like don't do back-channel chats about

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,180
work and this is something that I've

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,620
seen happen a lot cuz it's really easy

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,699
to do there's the conversation happening

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,279
about a piece of work

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,010
and then you like and I like I'll look

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,510
we were doing the the rebranding of the

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,610
the shirts or something like that and

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,949
then it spins off into a pro you know

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,320
p.m. a daddy my private conversation and

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:58,500
we make decisions we work on staff and

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,940
we arrive somewhere and then we bring it

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,360
back and everyone else's loses that

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,180
context so if there is work conversation

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,699
do everything you can to have that

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,800
conversation in the the appropriate

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,110
forum that whatever channel is set up

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,149
for that work try not to do back-channel

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,339
work that channel comment down

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,510
communication is another one act like

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,649
everyone is remote if you're in an

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,120
organization where like you know some

00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,100
people are remote some people are not

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,649
and you've got a meeting of six people

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,019
and there's five people sitting in the

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:31,140
room and there's one person one poor

00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,290
person on a on a laptop and there's

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,060
something seen like I guarantee 100% of

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,070
the time that that six person on the

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,899
laptop is remote will feel disconnected

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,000
and disengage from a conversation

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,440
wouldn't even be intentional and even

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,690
the other five people might be trying to

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,420
like do their best to bring them in but

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,209
that that divide that is physically

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,160
there it just it breaks down their level

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,750
for the ability for that person to fully

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,339
engage and contribute you know unless

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,110
they're super charismatic and you know

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,029
you know some individuals are amazing

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,350
like that sometimes but on you know but

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,089
for so much the time they will be

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,010
disconnected like if there's five people

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,110
in the office and one person dying in

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,680
remote those five people just go sit

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,029
somewhere else

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,620
around around the room around the

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,510
building around the office and all dial

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,660
in and jump on the zoom or hangouts call

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,370
and what that does for the whole team

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,709
dynamic to contributing to like better

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,709
communication and better flow is is um

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:24,300
it's it's fantastic

00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:26,760
defaults to async as well so

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,430
asynchronous communication shorthand for

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,290
put it in chat have the chat happened

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,240
within the slap channel that has been

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,940
set up for that work if you can default

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,170
to a sync it just if there's a little

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,019
bit more structure there and this is

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,029
sort of like my average experience

00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,800
across a lot of things is that there's a

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,870
little bit more structure there a gillis

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,329
that's people that are perhaps you know

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,240
within conversation and group chat like

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,410
on a call or a video call

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,360
personalities probably you know

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,190
unintentionally dictate to how much

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,389
voice some people are given and you know

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,440
things like that and I've just seen

00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,839
async communication facilitate good work

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,760
communication so much better and of

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,110
course there are always needs to jump on

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,519
a on a call on everything I don't know

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,680
of course when that when it's required

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,209
do that but you don't need to jump on

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,550
and have a meeting every single time if

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,699
you can async a string you know type in

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,209
in the chat throat there and have your

00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:22,829
communication and your meeting

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:25,079
asynchronously incredible value within

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:27,959
that whether it's on a call or in that

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,300
document all the things document things

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,850
well like I've seen so I work with a

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,010
bunch of project managers and team leads

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,709
at X company who are just you know

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,760
world-class and I put like one of the

00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,040
biggest things that makes them

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,709
world-class is their ability to capture

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,810
things that end decisions and moments

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,899
within meetings and just document them

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,610
well and you know not not like it's dot

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,430
point it's simple but if it's captured

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,620
but what they do is they document as the

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,209
conversation occurs and they they

00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,769
capture the moment they don't just

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,019
documents that right we'll call we today

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,620
we had a two-hour meeting that that's a

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,300
very long meeting

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,130
I wonder how he'd hear about this

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,559
project and this is where we arrive

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,000
document how you got there because our

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,750
mam a week later no one actually

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,059
remembers that meeting and had be able

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,309
to refer back to just just good simple

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,799
documentation makes a massive massive

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,329
difference and here's an interesting one

00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,829
this this is this is about you know

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,750
communication but in a specific area

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,760
especially within HR if you're in an

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,770
organization doing a remote of a larger

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,809
size like you're going to have to invest

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,240
more into onboarding so imagine like you

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,940
know your fur when you've all had a job

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,309
I most of us have had a job where we

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,800
rocked up for our first day into an

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,080
offer

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,910
and and you sort of like float around

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,290
and like just like you're just there and

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,230
and you kind of get your head around

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,300
stuff and and you kind of just absorb

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,650
what's going on and so I have rub you're

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,120
the new guy oh yeah this is what we're

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,680
doing over here you know there's a

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,200
physical presence there that sort of

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,270
just really carries on boarding along

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,970
and after a week or two you okay yeah I

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,190
get how things work but with remind that

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,750
just this is not there like if we

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,820
carried that sort of onboarding practice

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,490
through into a remote you know

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,140
environment you'd pull you know I can

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,580
imagine a developer joining our team and

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,290
we've sort of handled onboarding like

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,540
that they'd be like just sitting

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,850
literally on their own staring at a

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,370
empty slack just waiting for something

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,230
to happen so within within onboarding

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,670
specifically we have to invest more into

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,470
onboarding you know and you know there's

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,030
depending on the role depending on the

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,670
project whatever depending on the person

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,810
you know that takes on many many

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,420
different forms but we need to invest

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,820
more into onboarding I lost in

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,040
translation this is a really funny one

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,650
that catches people out all the time

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,630
it's easy to make assumptions about the

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,180
things and the things that we say and

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,730
how they translate and it's not even

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,340
always like cross-cultural cross

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,010
language like my first so when I first

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,230
joined xwp you know at X company I was

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,380
that came on as a project manager and I

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:03,310
had my two projects with - with a with a

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,710
Canadian client Rogers media and you

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,840
know they spoke English first language

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,550
English as well Canada I would actually

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,020
say culturally there's a lot of

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,310
crossover even more than it would

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,560
Australia even more than you know

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,150
America in Australia right like and you

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,440
know and I just you know got stuck and

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,480
when I remember this one day I use the

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,880
term I you know the you know the Deb's

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,440
they're really on the coalface you know

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,270
really getting into you know whatever

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,660
the works are moved on anyway go Matt at

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,130
Rogers sorry what my god you know

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,860
they're really everything on a cold face

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,380
what's the cold face oh my god you know

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,000
like you know the furthest point in a

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,080
mind like they're the ones right at the

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,130
end they're like getting into the work

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,260
they're like they're taking the mind

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,330
deeper they're like oh okay

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,240
I thought you're making a blackface

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,720
reference

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,679
oh no no no no and I'm so glad we

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,880
cleared that up but I and it's funny

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,790
things like that happen and it's flares

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,610
but always be careful about especially

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,470
idioms like that consider who you're

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,670
talking to and be aware of you know

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,620
cultural differences language

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:12,750
differences but even you know subtleties

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,490
like that cool rhythm and routine like I

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,130
said earlier who decided that 9:00 to

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,590
5:00 was right like I mean I have to

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,210
I've three kids two of them are in you

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,790
know sort of candy prep area so like

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,950
nine to five like really conflicts like

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,140
a lot would that's that routine thing

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,820
and you know being able to be flexible

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,890
around that with remote is fantastic

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:38,010
yeah but like I can tell like like

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,690
ninety nine to five may not be right for

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,220
everyone but I can tell you what's not

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,080
right and that's like you know 6:00 p.m.

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,820
to 3:00 a.m.

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,500
some people sort of swing pretty hard in

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,760
the other direction like ah I don't have

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,520
to do the nine to fly thing I'm gonna

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,770
sleep in go ahead over just a cruisee

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,630
lunch and I'll sit down and working 3

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,760
p.m. and I'll work through till 3:00 and

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,980
like that's fine every now and again but

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,170
I would say that that's not healthy long

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,090
term that disconnects us from getting

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,790
vitamin D which is apparently and very

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,070
important to us connecting with you know

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,520
people out in our community which are

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,710
awake at normal hours but so they of

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,900
course flexibility and remote but let's

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,490
be a reasonable and you know building

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,280
this is basically sum up was like build

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,290
routine I know when I first started

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,450
working a remote I just like embrace the

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,070
flexibility and I was doing bits of

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,809
snippets of work here and there and I

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,890
just you know jump over that cafe over

00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,050
there for a couple of hours and I go

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,480
somewhere else and I was fine it was fun

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,100
but it was really tiring it really saps

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,630
your energy when there's like when

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,120
you're constantly making decisions about

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,830
what I'm gonna do next and when and

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,940
things like that it's really draining so

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,220
when you actually go to do your work

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,220
yeah you know you've got reduced

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,200
capacity so have routine of course but

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,700
allow flexibility like you know I can go

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,100
if I have to do a doctor's appointment

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,920
for my kids I can or I can do the kidney

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,070
pickup if I need to or if you know for

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,110
whatever you know you can be flexible

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,710
you know break your day up one thing

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,750
that I've sort of

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,510
into my daily routine like three or four

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,100
days a week I'll take like an hour and a

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,230
half break in the middle of my day and

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,520
I'll go to the gym i remote lets me

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,559
facilitate that sort of thing as

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,690
fantastic and breaks my day up and lets

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,429
me do something physical resets my brain

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,200
but it you know break your day up you

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,940
don't have to do you may start at 9:00

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,679
a.m. you may start at 11:00 a.m. you may

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,130
start at 6:00 a.m. but you don't have to

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,539
do a big you know a tower block of work

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,799
break your day up it refreshes the mind

00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:33,870
and you know resets you for whatever you

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:36,330
need to do next so work home separation

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,799
for a lot of remote workers we work from

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,000
home our house

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,590
I mentioned that I actually have a

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,450
little office down that I you know you

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,659
know rent with my friends so this is the

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,480
biggest issue for me but hands up please

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:52,620
who work from that who work from their

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,299
house okay please keep your hand up if

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,520
you think you sort of struggle a bit

00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,320
with the work home separation thing I

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,710
said everybody put the hand down as a

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,760
liar I'm kidding you just may be more

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,679
diligent than I am but it's it's an

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,029
important thing and you know when you

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,080
work at an office and you go to the

00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,760
office and you leave the office it

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,460
there's a great mental divide there that

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,500
you can separate your your work from

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,539
your home the man from a remote you know

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,279
distributed workforces we this is an

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,840
area that we've got to be diligent in

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:27,600
because if your work home lines break

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,710
down like it's damaging so something to

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,880
be very careful you know become you

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,799
spend like another hour talking about

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,840
that thing alone you know things to try

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,240
but it's good thing to be aware of and

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,070
look you don't always have to be on

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,899
slacks great it also sucks

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,520
it's worse than email like you know what

00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,500
I mean like getting pings at random

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,750
times like don't log into your work

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,340
slack on your phone is an example that

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,620
you could or make sure you turn off

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,490
notifications and but you don't always

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:57,240
have to be on like momentum up my boss

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,679
at xwp he's just he's great guy and

00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,970
works really really hard and always does

00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,100
really odd hours and I was always like

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,630
sending me messages at odd hours or

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,830
following up an email that he loops me

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,820
in but he always says to me was like Rob

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,529
look I know you're seeing all this stuff

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,260
from me at like you know 11 p.m. on a

00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,669
Saturday like you don't have to like I'm

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,529
not expecting you to respond at those

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:14,880
times I just know when you come into the

00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,290
office you're then you

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,720
pick it up when you're there but like

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,520
you don't have to be on all the time so

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,780
sometimes that might have to be a can of

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,610
conversation that you have to have with

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,960
your colleagues your you know upline or

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,060
downline or something like that like oh

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,400
these are some these are some standards

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,430
we're going to set for the way we work

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,740
that we can decide when we're at work

00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,770
and when we're not at work and it has to

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,510
be okay but when someone's not at work

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,000
that you know you shouldn't be expected

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,770
to be able to reach out in them

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,350
I'm scrum like so the scrums like you

00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,340
know a project management methodology if

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,260
you're familiar with it you're familiar

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,480
with it if you're not I probably can't

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,310
explain it really easily but it's a

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,470
basically a fantastic way of applying

00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,270
like an agile approach to a project

00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,640
works fantastic with web development and

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,600
your engineering development team all

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,690
around the world for years have been

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,580
implementing it with great success I've

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,370
actually noticed the practices of scrum

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,230
and the way the team structured and the

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,090
cadence is within it really working well

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,370
for just general operational teams or

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,690
marketing teams or HR and accounts and

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,730
stuff like that and I don't see if

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,190
you'll feel working in a organization

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,960
which is you know a bit bigger and

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,600
you've got teams dedicated to marketing

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,400
or or HR or something like that check it

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,620
and you're familiar with scrum as well

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,050
check out the practices of scrum because

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,490
I've seems like really interesting

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:36,000
instances of success where just bringing

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,950
that level of structure to non project

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,410
work really really help like

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,210
productivity and clarity and getting

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:48,420
stuff done space look this is just about

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,220
the space that you work in like

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,290
sometimes you go to an office if you

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,000
work at an office and it's beautiful

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,740
there's good light they've invested into

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,710
you know good you know plants everywhere

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,570
and stand-up desk and stuff and I'm the

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,460
worst actually for my for my personal

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,350
remote home office and like I have these

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,090
like it's going to be amazing it's a

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,370
like custom artwork up and everything

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,080
like that and I'm like month passes

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,030
three months past six months I'm like oh

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,800
I still haven't really set things up but

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,650
it's important that like if you have a

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,000
zone for work make it a good space to

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,560
work because the other you know the

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,030
atmosphere and the space and the zone

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,160
that were operating in it totally

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,840
influences how we're feeling and how

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,950
well you know how we feel about the work

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,750
that we're doing how we feeling about

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,890
ourselves within the work that we're

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,640
doing

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,260
Senay things like you know having good

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,549
light you know having you know good

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,600
screens we're all sort of looking at

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:37,120
screens all the time if you can

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,740
facilitate and afford a good screen and

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,809
I'd like that that's totally worth it

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,400
good screen height you know that's not

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,350
good for your neck you know but having

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,210
it up here's is really good actually the

00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,260
interesting thing is that this is one of

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,360
the really interesting things I've

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,990
noticed about remote and working on

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,539
remote teens like I work with I were

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:58,240
trying for like years and had no idea

00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,620
how told it was you just don't know and

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,169
then occasionally you meet them in

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,740
person like you're six foot seven you're

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,570
huge

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,510
I had no idea it's just one of the

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,039
interesting things that you the screen

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,220
height thing right but anyway so make

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,559
sure you have a good screen height like

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,020
I loved having a stand up desk like you

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,760
know do that thing if you like variation

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,039
as well like you know go to different

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,470
spaces to break things up it's amazing

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,700
how often like on a like Friday like end

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,520
of the week and it's sort of like

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,659
lunchtime and I'm like off so like you

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,100
know winding down for the weekend but

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:36,010
I've got this chunk of work that I need

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,100
to do but my brain is just starting to

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:41,289
switch off and go onto Friday Night

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,820
Football mode and then I just go alright

00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:45,070
I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna actually

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,539
go see that there's a little beer garden

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,909
near my place I'm gonna have a Friday

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,500
afternoon beer but I'm gonna I've got my

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:52,990
laptop and I'm just gonna punch through

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,370
those last bunch of tasks that I know I

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,260
really should get done before the

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,960
weekend and I just changed my location

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,059
and it's incredible how it just resets

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
the mind and just you know you know it

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,600
figure Eight's the mind if you need to

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,179
get that work done so like be variation

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,860
in your space you know good audio good

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,630
air good food all that sort of stuff

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,190
have a space with focus but then also

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,240
have a space for interaction as well

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,970
like one of the things I do like about

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,500
my little office co-working space is if

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,090
I'm like I'm not isolated from other

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,770
people if I'd only I can walk out and I

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,360
can see someone and have a chat like

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,220
being isolated we'll talk a bit more

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,960
about isolation in a second but I make

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,100
sure that if you can have have a space

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:34,029
for interaction with others work should

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,200
be more than work so within you know for

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,970
instance like you know your slack

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,890
channels and stuff like that have

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,610
channels for shared interests like have

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,850
a foodie

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,710
a channel have a beer channel have a

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,990
Friday night 40 channel if you know

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,880
whatever if there are things that people

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,800
within your team your organization can

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,690
connect over have channels that people

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,070
can just talk about that and connect and

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,660
fight shared interests maybe a channel a

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,700
shared interest there we go shared

00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,280
experiences bounties and the vault I'm

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,510
just gonna touch on that momentarily to

00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,980
meet the CEO okay this is interesting

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,070
right I guess a I'm working in a big

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,810
organization of 500 people in Brisbane

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,480
here and we all work at the same office

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:15,040
and I go in I walk around and I have you

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,440
know I'm involved I'm part of a team of

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,720
six so most of my interactions with that

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,790
team of six but you know then I go you

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,440
to lunch and I see those other people

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,300
and I see there's other than I walk past

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,890
you know the CEO and the leaders of the

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,070
organization and you know there's just

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,840
chances to engage with other people

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,850
within an organization outside of your

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,770
immediate team that doesn't exist in

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,780
remote automatically it just doesn't

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,250
exist be so easy and I've seen it happen

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,780
for myself and others as well we hit

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,120
when we have not been intentional about

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,340
this if you don't create the space to

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,190
meet the CEO or just others in the

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:52,540
organization it doesn't happen and look

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,610
that can like um you you know that can

00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,040
be like loads Town Hall style meetings

00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,810
or even know fun days like a game days

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,490
or if you can do it like in-person

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,350
meetups like Luke Bryan and I've all got

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,170
together this week around Brisbane here

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,980
like Ryan came over from Mexico and like

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,600
you know we've been able to in-person

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,010
stuff if you can facilitate that stuff

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,990
that's fantastic well it does for

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:15,760
connection and you know doing stuff is

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:18,310
fantastic or you know strategy sessions

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,890
so sometimes you need to go really deep

00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,530
into strategy and you know play some

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,240
rocket League that sort of like a once

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,010
they fill me me and a few of the others

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,510
at X company every Friday weeks would

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,740
play rocket League for a couple of hours

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,510
you know for an hour so on a Friday

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,100
afternoon and then just let your hair

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,720
down and relax but you know that sort of

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:40,180
stuff is fun professional development

00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,940
within a remote organization it's harder

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,170
to learn by osmosis if you're in an

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,180
office it's easy to sort of it's like

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,320
look over you know to sort of hey you

00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,610
have just done this thing over here can

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,710
you help me out or hey although I saw

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,000
you I saw you doing that what about this

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,590
or you know walking to lunch are you

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,210
know how me

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,740
chat about what you're working on it's

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,929
incredible what we can learn from each

00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,580
other despite being in the presence of

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,960
each other when we're working for a moat

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,380
we just have to be more intentional

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,000
about it so find ways to share knowledge

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,230
and that could be like anything like if

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
someone does something really cool on a

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,000
project find a way of sharing that with

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,750
the rest of the team share wins this is

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,309
something that we're starting to

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,390
implement at X company like when so like

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,039
really cool happens within a project

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,179
capture that and share it with McCullum

00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,580
wins share it with the wider

00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,380
organization it's amazing what that

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,580
fosters in conversation and then it

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,870
often Turk said how did you actually

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,360
technically implement that

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:32,159
oh we do you know a headless Gatsby

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,450
thing when WP graphic you are like I've

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,340
been thinking about doing that under

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,200
though you know and that that fosters

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,570
the sharing of information and provide

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,179
company access to learning resources and

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,190
if it's appropriate allow people to

00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,020
build time for just professional

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,039
development like give them work out like

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,059
head of time for doing this sort of

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:57,330
stuff oh there we go although there it

00:31:51,059 --> 00:32:02,580
is there well being so this is a social

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:04,260
separation presents according to a study

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,850
and I checked this out so come ask me

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,850
for the reference or the resource if you

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:11,210
want a 30% greater risk for early

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,020
mortality so served for separation

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,260
contributions and greater risk for early

00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,659
mortality for those we know following in

00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,350
social isolation that's worse than the

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:24,539
most other health other health related

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:28,140
factors so being separated from other

00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,789
people seriously can be dangerous so

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,620
within our remote work within

00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,909
distributed workforce something we have

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,549
to be careful of we have to be

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,770
intentional about being aware of that

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,460
and facilitating things to make sure we

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,899
keeping our friends our peers our team

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,520
safe and yeah this is everyone's

00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,779
responsibility and sometimes that's

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,130
encouraging people to have community

00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:51,990
outside of work making check-ins you

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,539
know just part of process like for X

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,039
company when we submit an invoice it

00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,830
goes to just another sort of forms

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,480
saying hey how are things going are you

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,220
feeling happy about the team and your

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,909
project just you know a part of process

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,269
just checking in on stuff you know our

00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:07,919
UI

00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:10,169
okay you know the are you okay day thing

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,249
fantastic it should be part about every

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,729
day we should be like intentionally

00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:19,080
looking out for uh peers and for their

00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:20,580
well-being well-being so like six large

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,809
buckets there with a whole bunch of the

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,089
things that I've observed over the years

00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:26,070
I hope maybe there's one or two in there

00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:29,339
you found interesting and that might

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:31,200
take away but thank you very very very

00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:40,889
much for listening to me today and your

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:43,709

yeah thanks Rob yeah again if you have

00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:50,940
questions can you please come down the

00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:52,229
front and get microphones yep respect to

00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,469
the volunteers who've just been doing

00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:58,440
this all weekend up and down the stairs

00:33:54,469 --> 00:34:00,899
haha thanks for that um I heard you say

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,969
number five is gonna blow your mind

00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:09,270
oh yeah um yeah did it expand no just

00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:10,500

got you but you didn't leave the room

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:24,990
you hung around it worked no that's all

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:27,750
I wanted Cheers in the middle thanks for

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:30,539
the talk really good insight on that

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,119
type of the work environment question

00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:36,089
would be so for myself I'm in an office

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,220
space job yep how would you go about

00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:39,750
approaching you know that the boss about

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,470
potentially moving from an office space

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,700
to a remote base working environment

00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:48,149
that's a really good question

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,010
I actually haven't personally like done

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,299
trim that sort of transition myself so I

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:56,220
don't have a whole lot of personal

00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:57,869
experience I'd so like like mostly it

00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,609
comes down to baby steps and making it

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:02,010
seem more like hey live just a day a

00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:03,839
week like I mentioned that guy in like

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,609
the college in Sydney he does the

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,010
four-hour to meet thing he said hey look

00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:09,599
I'd love to just work a day a week from

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,619
work I don't do for remote but if we

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,200
could start with a day that'd be

00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,390
fantastic you know so for that for maybe

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,930
the upline that aren't familiar with it

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,490
or

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,800
I've heard of bad things about it like

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,020
just keeping it really simple it's just

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:36,599
the you know the best way to approach it

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:38,730
broadly speaking so yeah thank you you

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,829
almost touched on something in your talk

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,630
that I think would have been really

00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:45,349
interesting you said you get back to a

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,880
beat in all the same ways could you

00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:51,180
expound on that oh yeah okay so we have

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,329
this thing in X company and we're we're

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,069
really you know proud of our remote

00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:57,930
culture and community I mentioned at the

00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:59,220
start that really I feel like that's how

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,160
we should think about things culture and

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,990
community operas and processes but one

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,670
of the things that we have is these

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,440
ideas of them I have a slide I'm sure I

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,800
had a slide but it didn't show up but

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,510
bounties and the vault and you know it's

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,250
a game of fired experience but what it

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,680
is it basically it's all about fostering

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,869
shared experiences you know if we have a

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,339
shared experience like you know we bunch

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,319
of us know each other from the WordPress

00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:24,869
Australia slack and probably have

00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:26,790
crossed paths but if we had a chat with

00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,099
each other I'll smile up but after party

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,049
just having that shared experience

00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,799
outside of work like all of a sudden

00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:33,930
like you know there's a deeper

00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:36,030
connection there it's more fun and so

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:40,589
bounties are about a shared experience

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:43,609
and they can be anything write read a

00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:45,780
watch a film go watch some in-game

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:47,250
Avengers end game and provides your

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,260
opinion on who really should have died

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,020
and share that in you know the movies

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,940
channel completely unrelated to work

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,569
it's a small simple thing all there's

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,569
