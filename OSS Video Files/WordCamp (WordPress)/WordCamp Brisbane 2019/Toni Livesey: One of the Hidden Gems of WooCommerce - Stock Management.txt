[Applause]

00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:00,990
[Music]

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,929
[Applause]

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,779
[Music]

00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:08,790
yes good excellent okay so the reason

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,550
why I'm running my talk today on stroke

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,320
management is because I'm not sure if

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,590
he's here today but I actually had an

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,380
email from a gentleman saying help

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,980
because he runs hit wall he runs an

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,939
agency and he's been setting up stores

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,029
running WooCommerce and he couldn't get

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,500
his stop controlling to work

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,500
it'll just took a little tick in the box

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,190
to actually make it work but what we've

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,040
actually found is parts we've got many

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,809
many clients around Australia at the

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,510
moment we don't necessarily do a lot of

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,629
stuff overseas anymore and one of the

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,129
things that they actually find is that

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:54,570
stop managing looking after their

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,550
inventory is really boring and they hate

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,559
counting just like the count dust

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:07,290
he loves counting and they think that

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:09,600
it's really really boring in fact I

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,320
think counting stock can be as boring as

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,369
as bet and I'm just I can't say that

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,259
word he because I think there's some

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,729
kids in here so we've got these pretty

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,280
little droppings going down so how many

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,520
people do like keeping their inventory

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,979
up to date with their e-commerce shops

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:33,450
do you find it easy all right yes okay

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,909
so a lot of people do find it very

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,040
difficult to do they find it boring and

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,320
they hate doing it but we're commerce

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,750
does it all for you so we when you're

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,479
doing stock management stock management

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,530
for your online shops and I am nervous

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,600
today so I do apologize it's really

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,399
important in this just takes just adding

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,520
in the quantity for each of your

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,740
products but for some people that's very

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,770
very difficult but we're commerce makes

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,630
it easy if you run your online shop

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,280
properly and you put a tick in the box

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,600
to control your stock so

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,040
just gonna see you this works from way

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,720
and once again counting stop Kirby as

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,180
warheads counting it makes you go

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,120
to sleep

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,160
who does stock management benefit it

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,760
benefits you if you're a business owner

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,890
it benefits you it benefits you because

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,770
you are keeping the stock up to date

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:37,310
your your products aren't going to run

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,050
out of stock without you knowing and it

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,640
benefits your customer because they know

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,700
where the product is either out of stock

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,989
or you they can keep ordering if you

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,870
don't keep those stock levels up then

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:53,840
you must not be in business because if

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,040
your products are suddenly out of stock

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,890
and non can buy anything you're not

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,590
making any money sorry

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,410
now when you are doing a stock control

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,930
it can be any sort of shop we've got

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,510
some family members who run various

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,000
different businesses they run businesses

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,880
from doing fruit boxes fruit and veggie

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,820
boxes every week to people selling

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:24,290
costumes you can have a lolly shop you

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,430
can have a fashion place so regardless

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,010
of the type of business that you're

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,620
running you need to have your stock

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,380
control up to date and it just means as

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,440
you add a product into WooCommerce you

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:41,420
maintain that product quantity it's

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,730
really quite easy so stock management

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,280
can be very boring as I said but for

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:50,090
every business it's also very extremely

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,560
important so you have inventory the

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,560
stock control we because you've stopped

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,060
stock management nearly every business

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,100
should have some form of stock

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,720
management in place we know lots of

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,390
people who keep their inventory in a

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,799
spreadsheet but if you're running

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,380
WooCommerce you can have that as a

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,680
product quantity you can also do it as

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,600
your variance so for every type of

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,340
product that you have if you have to if

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,500
you're running t-shirts and you've got

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,660
different sizes you can put the quantity

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,419
in if you have different colors in those

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,920
t-shirts you can also put your quantity

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,500
in so

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,720
whenever something runs out of stock

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,550
you'll get a notification to say that

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,600
that's coming up it's running out of

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,890
stock you got to order some more eating

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,040
now it's going dry so it does benefit

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:45,070
you and it benefits your clients and it

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,070
can work with any sort of product it can

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:52,120
also work with your services people who

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:55,060
are doing bookings and reservations we

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,110
have other clients who sell tickets

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,760
online for events we also do have some

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,010
who are doing tourism events in the

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,210
indigenous community so they keep track

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,120
of their tickets that they're selling

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,630
for those tourists for the tools that

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,580
they do yeah just trying to think what

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:19,090
they do yeah so that's what they do so

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:22,180
it makes your job easy so as I said at

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,030
the start we got a screen for help in

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,800
the form of an email and it's the reason

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,230
that I'm here today and doing this talk

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,390
because his question was how do I get

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,510
stock control to show so I can manage

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,980
stock in my online shop because he went

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,090
to put products in but he couldn't add

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,980
any stock control because there was just

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,320
one little tick in the box when you go

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,470
into your products in inventory and you

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,190
set it to global and it's really quite

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:55,300
easy once you set that to global you can

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,060
add all your stock control in so it can

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,030
be as a simple product as the variant is

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,620
a downloadable product and in we're

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,430
commerce you can even do drop shipping

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,460
products now as well the other ways that

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,610
you can manage inventory in your store

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,170
or your stock control is through point

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,120
of sales through vendor and square and

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,520
you can also use your accounting system

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
Xero or QuickBooks because you can also

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,050
set up your inventories through there as

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,760
well so you can actually integrate those

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:34,720
into your WooCommerce store we have done

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,850
then before the vendor is really quite

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,740
interesting because

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,240
we have various clients who use fanned

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,710
they have all their products in there

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,199
and use the event plugin that integrates

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:51,229
all your products that you have invent

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,900
over to you where commerce store but

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,610
then you work on your on your stock over

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,949
here and you can keep your quantities

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,410
up-to-date as well and you can do that

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,970
all from from WooCommerce and then it

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,009
goes back to then so you can update

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,360
everything in WooCommerce and not even

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,360
go back to them if you don't want to

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:17,900
excuse me so to get to that spot where I

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,190
was telling you about you need to login

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,039
to your admin area so has anyone ever

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,460
worked with WooCommerce where you have

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,510
to manage your stock control has it you

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,190
have yeah great okay so you click on

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:38,960
WooCommerce and you go into settings and

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,169
then you go for products and then you

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,120
click on inventory now this is the

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,389
question this was so easy for him to fix

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,039
once we worked it out for him and there

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,620
is a section there that says manage

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,490
stock and once you put that ticket in

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,789
the box for an able stock management you

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,810
can start working within your shop and

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,020
controlling your stock management and

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,030
your inventory but always remember to

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,460
save because if you don't save it's not

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,180
going to to work for you so this will

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,190
actually enable your stock management

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,840
globally so it's not just for one

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,030
product so if you just want to manage

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,010
stock just for one product and not the

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,050
rest unfortunately you just can't do

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,659
that you've got it you've got to work

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,639
with it and if you don't want to worry

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,070
about your quantities for all the other

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:34,580
products you still need to put a tick in

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:38,029
that box now when we're also working

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,219
with stock you've also got to remember

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,349
about the products that you buy or it

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,410
customer comes on one buys because it's

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,149
going to take away that product from

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,819
your quantity

00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:55,350
and what I've found is you can do this

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:57,240
two ways if you want a product to or in

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,709
order to be canceled out after a certain

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,730
period of time because they haven't paid

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:05,089
so it goes back to stock allow them time

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,800
because if you've got a direct deposit

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,990
section on there some payments take

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,610
three days to shop so if you put about

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,550
four thousand three hundred and twenty

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,559
minutes in there you should be right and

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,529
if not leave it at naught but then you

00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,939
have to make sure that you've checked to

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,649
see whether that person is going to go

00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,999
through that order or not because you

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,629
want it back in stock you don't want

00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:30,029
that out of stock you can also do your

00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:33,749
notifications for your stock

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:37,110
notifications so for example we run

00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:39,749
online shops as well I want to make sure

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,779
I get those low stock notifications so I

00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:44,879
usually have it set to two and also

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,069
enable out of stock notifications so if

00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,540
a product is completely out of stock you

00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:53,129
want to know about it as well you need

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,519
to be up on top of it and I generally

00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:58,589
hide out of stock items from the catalog

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,879
however we have some clients who prefer

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:04,649
to leave that an ticked so that they can

00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,600
continue ordering so they can backorder

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,399
those products and then that way they're

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,040
still getting paid for it you can also

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,230
set up your stock display format so

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,069
always show quantity remaining in stocks

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,689
so if it is becoming low in stock the

00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,220
customer comes along next time we'll see

00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,509
how many is in stock I mean they might

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,509
want to buy twenty but you've only got

00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:29,639
twelve so at least they know so you can

00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:33,360
handle lots of things from within

00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,040
WooCommerce you can have another section

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,769
there that says I only show quantity

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,569
remaining in stock when it's low so if

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,029
there's only two left you can show that

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,860
as well you don't have to show that at

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,919
all you just mark it as out of stock

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,919
[Music]

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,439
enabling stock management allows you to

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,459
manage your stock your products event

00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:57,750
tickets and so much more in various ways

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,630
so it depends on what you are selling

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,839
what services you're selling

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,360
you may be selling partial portions of

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,649
your time so it just depends on what

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,540
you're selling you can actually set your

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:15,839
stock management up so if we went into a

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,839
simple product so for those who are only

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,130
just starting out in WooCommerce and you

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,139
don't know what a simple product is it's

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,980
just it's it's a product that doesn't

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,800
have any attributes or variants so it

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,720
may be just a white t-shirt there's only

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,500
one size there's no different colors

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,279
it's just white

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,370
so you set up your inventory and you SKU

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,930
cuz you need to have that and there's a

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,350
tick in the box there that you can

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,750
actually manage your stock management as

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,600
well so if you've got no other products

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,449
no sizes or anything else you can just

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,610
manage it straight from your product so

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:55,800
when you're in simple product even you

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,810
still need that box tick to have that in

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,259
there so that you can manage because you

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,690
might have 20 white t-shirts all the one

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,360
size there's no varying colors but just

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,250
do want to manage your stock you can

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,560
have it in stock so you can show it's in

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,370
stock or you can also allow them to just

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,220
buy one off so if you don't want them to

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,259
have more than one white t-shirt in size

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,209
large that's what you do you have to

00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,399
just take that because you're only going

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:27,959
to allow them to buy one and that's

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,149
where it is there as well so we've got

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,600
our SKU we've got enable stock

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:35,699
management I've got four we're not going

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,949
to allow back orders and the low

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:39,600
threshold is two so once I once I've

00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,300
sold two it's going to notify me that

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,329
I've got two left and they can buy more

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,709
than one if they want to unless that's

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:52,170
how to stop you can also do it as a

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:56,399
variable product does anyone know what a

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,170
variable product is yep so you can have

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,870
different colors you can have different

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,130
sizes different shapes you're gonna have

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,630
a t-shirt that I've got three sleeves

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,000
for pete's sake

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,760
you can do whatever you like as long as

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,459
you set it as a variable product so you

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,370
would you can give it an SKU as you like

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,980
if you like because you can add to that

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,320
unable to stop product if you want to so

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,400
if you just want to say for example I

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,860
have a hundred pieces and you put it in

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,620
your stock quantity you can just leave

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,110
it as that but it's not going to manage

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,290
your quantities properly but if you go

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:38,610
through and set up your attributes so

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,800
that you can do your variations you can

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,550
then manage stock so you once you've got

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,350
your variations set up you can actually

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,720
point in addition you cannot see what

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm pointing to you to put a tick in the

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,580
box for manager stock once you're in

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,070
your variations and it allows you to put

00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:59,100
in how many pieces you have of that

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,740
stock so if it's a size large white

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,320
t-shirt you can actually put it in there

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,570
and then if you've got a blue one you

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,090
can have the same thing so you can have

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,040
15 pieces of the white t-shirt and you

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,170
could have 20 pieces of the blue and

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,560
then you can even do it in the different

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:22,200
sizes as well as you can see the stock

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,120
man the menu stock button is checked and

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,640
then you can put your quantities in

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,990
there and then you can also say do I

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,520
want to allow back orders a lot and I've

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,780
just kept going through so you can see I

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,220
can duck through various different

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,740
things and for example we've got a

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,970
steampunk choker which one my sister

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,650
sells we've got two in stock we can fit

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,510
the quantity and because she's got

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,720
several different colors we've got to

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,100
drop down there and each time if I was

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,930
to buy one of each color it would

00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:01,560
actually just take the stock off my

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:03,690
quantity if you're managing your

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,740
stocking you think I don't have time you

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:12,600
can use quick edit so you can actually

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,370
choose numerous different products at

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,880
one time if you want to update them all

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,270
very quickly in this case I've just done

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,610
the one so you can quick edit stock just

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,620
by hovering over and still going in it

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,030
just go quick edit it allow you to

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,760
update your stock

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:36,150
you know stock quantity and then just

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:41,190
remember to update that's just to follow

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:43,200
on for that one and that's it how they

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:48,390
have no more just say that was quick I

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:57,770
must have been very nervous thank you

00:15:48,390 --> 00:16:07,950
very much any questions any questions

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:10,920
honest is there any easy way when you've

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,900
got like two sister sites selling

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,350
exactly the same product from the same

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:20,460
place so that one talks to the other I

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:26,690
haven't seen a plug-in that would do

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,690
that yet I wish we did I'll have to ask

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,550
might have to get one custom-made

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,780
interesting one we've got a client who's

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,970
actually got three warehouses around the

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,320
world and we're position where we're

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,120
building a work on a shopping cart with

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,160
drop shipping so it can work out the

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,290
postage and everything we've got weather

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,240
based on where the warehouse is however

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,960
the only list each product once

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,560
how can is it possible for the the stock

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,960
management to reflect what's actually at

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,210
the warehouse

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:09,000
end not just at the product level level

00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,920
are they using the same system same

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,440
website for all three so that would be

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,370
the same as using a POS system for

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,980
example vend yes will allow you to set

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:22,170
up different locations and you've got

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,110
your quantities here so your inventory

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,390
is sitting in your POS and once you

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,390
update that as long as you have your

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,160
other locations set up it will update

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,780
them okay cool

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,550
yeah so I would have a look at that and

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,380
just see if that system is set like that

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,690
because you can set up let different

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,149
locations and it's

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,879
I'm square if you're running a POS

00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:46,159
system and you have all your products in

00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:48,710
there with your inventory set up in

00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:50,659
there it should update you're like the

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,490
the quantities and someone buys

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:53,269
something based from the location it's

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,889
coming from that's right

00:17:53,269 --> 00:18:04,700
even though it's listed once on the

00:17:54,889 --> 00:18:06,799
website that's right thank you hi so

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,049
when you manage the stock do you export

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,730
they are to a spreadsheet and back in or

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,070
do you just go onto the site and many

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,889
sit that way so what were you sorry what

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,990
was that you were saying when you manage

00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:22,220
these stock levels do you explore it out

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,899
onto a sheet on how you're doing it if

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,899
you've only got a few products you can

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:29,509
do it within your website itself by

00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:31,639
going you could even do a bulk edit for

00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,950
your quantities or you can actually

00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:36,679
export your products if you're doing a

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,210
major upload change all the quantities

00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,629
and then re-upload it and you can do

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,460
that from within your product area now

00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:45,889
so you can export all those in a bulk up

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,480
bulk download and then just block upload

00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,879
them if you've got thousands of products

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,120
hundreds of products if not just do it

00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:55,100
on your website and do it as a bulk edit

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,950
through list you can actually take what

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,970
products you want to update and then go

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,629
edit bulk it it if you want me to show

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,629
you later I can't

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:15,419
atony is there a way to manage or

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:17,130
integrate WooCommerce into eBay and

00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,169
Amazon so that you manage all your stock

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,340
levels through WooCommerce and all the

00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:25,289
product information plug-in called it's

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,659
for Amazon any base so if you go to

00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:32,580
WooCommerce comm they actually have a

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:38,419
plug-in there for eBay and Amazon it's

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,419
okay just one so I have a look at that

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:49,169
my question is what reporting tools to

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,880
use for for your clients reporting tools

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:53,370
yeah at any time you'll want to take a

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,960
snapshot of the inventory or well

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,210
generally admin theme with their own

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,510
products so we we show them how to

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,730
update their own quantities so they know

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:07,679
what products they have so they only

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,149
have to look within their wordpress

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,799
website to have a look to see what

00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:13,500
products they have or they can download

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,840
it as a you know as a spreadsheet and

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,039
have a look at it that way it's entirely

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,580
up to them they can run their own

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,649
reports through we're commerce but we

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:35,370
don't tend to look after their reports

00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:37,409
because they do it themselves thank you

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,049
have you ever experienced like

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:43,710
integration between the stock management

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:47,639
in e-commerce and accounting system like

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,799
a my OB inventory system I haven't come

00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:53,340
across the my OB one but I have

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,880
certainly seen the zero one and bend and

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,880
QuickBooks oh you did do you have any

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,399
solution or just flogging that I can use

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,320
well usually there's a plug-in for most

00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:06,240
things so I would have a look online to

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,769
see if there's one for my OB because I

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,039
have never had to look for well alright

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,659
yeah yes a peer I think actually does a

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,460
lot of those sorts of things as well so

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,460
have a look on me hmm

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:28,809
oh my gosh all the way up the back

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,600
corner I hope it worked I hope it's

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,220
worth it I'm here hi Tony how are you

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,380
good how are you good

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,669
what's your recommendation for advanced

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,440
stock plugins advanced plug-in so for

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,020
really large stores but I want to say

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,419
say the stock all in one view or managed

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,850
to stock without actually having to go

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,650
so for example Christmas sales the

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,320
company might want to actually just be

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,500
able to change the stock you know in one

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,510
or few rather than having to go in and

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,600
out of plugins all the time and if you

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:04,150
had any experience with sort of besides

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,640
your sort of default we stock management

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,110
any other plugin recommendations that

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,650
are worth looking into I really haven't

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,140
had to use any other except for I did

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,700
buy one to do all my bulk uploading and

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,010
then found out that WooCommerce will

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,350
allow me to do everything anyway after

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,960
we bought the license for it so I

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,950
haven't used any advanced once because

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,240
we really haven't had to with Commerce

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,000
seems to be able to do a lot of things

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,820
and if you're working with bigger

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,380
systems like Bend and square and you

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,059
have you inventory already set up in

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,700
those usually that's where you would

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:49,090
manage it anyway and that updates at all

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:50,559
oh hi Tony Dave I've been kind of

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:54,220
wrecking my Brian over the last 20 30

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:58,320
minutes how this would work I do use the

00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:00,669
WooCommerce engine inventory component

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,470
but it's only four items I have two

00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:04,270
hundred and twenty odd items but I don't

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,669
always stock them so I sell products

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,400
that I don't have in stock and I use my

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:12,669
inventory through zero which works

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,380
beautifully with WooCommerce so I'm just

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,470
wondering how there's adjustments made

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,270
if you're you know doing a stock take

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,159
you find you're down a couple of items I

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,600
guess the financial transaction needs to

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,220
be done through your accounting package

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,549
to make that adjustment that's right

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,230
yeah yeah we did have a question about

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,950
Xero and a lot of the things

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:36,799
for example had to be done within zero

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,590
I don't like zero either but there are

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,360
other systems that I prefer to use zero

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,880
seems to be the hardest and you do have

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,280
to use EQ I'm a lover of zero it works

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,870
beautifully for me I could understand

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,910
applications where people have that

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,230
stock in their shop and they're selling

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,650
it yeah and that would probably work

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,360
quite well for them and I'm just trying

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,350
to work out how I phrases question -

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,500
that's what I was just correcting

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,299
through my brain so yeah my reliance is

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,210
very much on the zero side of things of

00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:10,070
inventory I can't put that order across

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:12,049
to zero unless I've got that stock item

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,309
in there yeah so I can't complete that

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:16,580
order until it's in there because that's

00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:19,220
the it's reliant on that so but anyway

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,910
thanks for the presentation no no sorry

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,910
