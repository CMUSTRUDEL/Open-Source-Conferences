[Applause]

00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,450
hello okay great awesome thank you cam

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,960
and I seriously love it that you are on

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,200
brand it's awesome so just a quick bit

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,240
about pixel palace Oh actually no let me

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
just start with a bit about my talk

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,310
first of all this talk is all about

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,449
perspective like cam just said there's a

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,039
few people in this room that have worked

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,359
on $50,000 WordPress sites I'm

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,820
guaranteeing there's a probably a lot

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,070
that I like holy-moly that's a lot of

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,869
money for a wordpress site so I'm just

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,020
out of interest who thinks that $50,000

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,370
is a lot for a wordpress site yeah and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,820
who thinks it's not much yeah and who

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,690
says it depends it depends yeah me it

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,700
totally depends right and so today I'm

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,500
going to talk about why it depends and

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,329
hopefully answer the question at least

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,399
from our perspective of a small agency

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,840
in the space about what goes into a

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,280
fifty thousand dollar site and why it's

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,350
really good value in the right

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,850
circumstances so yep anything about this

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,769
topic to lots of people you get a lot of

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,430
different opinions on it there's two

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,159
parts to it

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,900
one two parts to a high value website in

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,020
my opinion one is the stuff you can see

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,479
so design dev build functionality stuff

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,130
like that but the other bits a little

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,229
bit more abstract it's about value-based

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,110
pricing so I'm gonna dive into both

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,600
those things today in the talk but just

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,820
to recap a bit about me and pixel palace

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,650
so like cam said those who don't know if

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,009
anyone saw my talk last year but I kind

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,619
of dived right into my life story a bit

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,200
in terms of humanizing the brand and if

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,490
you didn't see it the video is up on

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,320
WordCamp TV I'm not going to go into all

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,020
this again now but yeah really

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,720
interesting I started in web after my

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,149
glitt'ring music career ended and I

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,799
started out building business catalyst

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:58,380
sites actually in 2007 ish and I was

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,719
building sites for about 500 bucks when

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,210
I started I had a few contacts for my

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,040
music industry stuff so I was getting to

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,300
work on some cool things just from home

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,220
I just had my first baby and at the time

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,850
I was like talking to a friend on my

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,860
couch on weed first when I first started

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,050
I was like ah imagine if I could earn

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,390
500 bucks a week from this this would be

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,010
oh my god amazing

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,720
and I think at that time I charged like

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,610
some 3 grand for an e-commerce site and

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,390
I thought I've made it that was it

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:31,120
this was freaking unreal so it was about

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,520
2011 I found a picture Palace after that

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,180
and in about 2011 we moved to being

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,730
WordPress specific and now twelve years

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,670
on we specialize in strategic marketing

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,530
and custom WordPress in particular to

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,260
talk in terms of price our custom sites

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,970
range from about the 20 grand mark start

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,220
point up to $100,000 would be the

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,610
biggest one we've done and we're a small

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,890
team is seven as of last week I'm

00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,840
currently scaling the business but for a

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,960
while there it was only three now it's

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,420
been five for a bit and now is seven so

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,130
exciting times so I'm going to talk

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,170
about some site today and I am NOT

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,580
saying that any of these sites or the

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,290
sites on a portfolio or these clients

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,400
paid fifty thousand dollars that is not

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,140
what I'm saying

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,850
but I think it's important to show you

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,110
some examples of some functionality and

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,420
things that we've built that are

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,750
examples of things that go into a high

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,840
value custom site so some of our clients

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,190
at Pixar palace include businesses like

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,750
women's agenda which is a large news

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,060
site out of New South Wales we have done

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,710
quite a few jobs for RSPCA over the

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,920
years we've got another one on the boil

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,590
at the moment and particularly their

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,730
humane food division we launched travel

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,770
bootcamp this year which was a really

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,080
great custom site for a bunch of travel

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,370
Instagrammer bloggers influences that

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,870
run a really fantastically large event

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,280
every year internationally to teach

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,710
people how to make money from traveling

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,010
and we've done quite a few travel sites

00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,450
so big complex African safari sites

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,370
we've done a couple things like that so

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,520
lots of content lots of pulling of stuff

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,420
multilingual blah blah blah so that's

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:14,380
the sort of examples of work that we do

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:17,200
so what goes into a high-value site

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,390
well obviously design and development

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,910
and I think most people think that

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,130
that's what we do and it is that I mean

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,660
that's the basics right the foundations

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,630
everyone does that

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,580
but this is from our agency perspective

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,230
it's much more than that so we include

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,260
things like custom components is a big

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,000
one in adding value I know speaking some

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,800
of the talks over the last few days have

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,330
really talked about some of the more

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,870
custom stuff that people are doing in

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,920
WordPress so that's a massive value out

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,630
and one of the bits I'm going to dive

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,660
into in a bit more detail and show some

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,750
examples of the stuff that we've built

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,490
its UX and UI so strategic design and

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,140
it's using our design experience

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,470
combined with data and strategy to

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,530
design a website that actually has goals

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,470
in mind so its strategic and it's not

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,000
just pretty pictures training and

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,970
handover so management of the site

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,370
afterwards so the backend architecture a

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,770
huge value in that and can be very time

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,020
consuming in planning as well as

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,730
customer service so pixel pellets were

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,950
really big on the customer experience of

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,230
clients working with us so that's

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,540
another big value add and then finally

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,800
strategy and planning huge huge amount

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,470
of time can go into strategy and

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,850
planning on a high-value site because

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,310
there's often a lot to work with like a

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,370
marketing team at our business or just

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,950
lots of content and lots of things to

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,380
keep in mind to lay foundations for a

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,270
successful project so this stuff is just

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,680
the ticket to the game stuff right like

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,000
every agency should be doing this most

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,210
freelancers would be doing some of this

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,940
if not all of this as well it's a really

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,880
good place to start obviously but I'm

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,350
going to just look at this from a client

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,930
perspective of world because this is

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,340
part of the thing about adding value and

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,430
how you start getting up into higher

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,070
value in the space of web so from a

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,110
client perspective on a web project they

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,220
see all these same things it's all the

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,750
same things but they have a different

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,330
meaning to clients and a different level

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,800
of importance so like design they see

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,140
designers you know it's gonna make me

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,090
look cool if I'm gonna speak value to

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,440
clients in this space they want to know

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,940
that this is going to make them look

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,150
awesome and their competitors are going

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,840
to go WOW okay that's really cool

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,180
they're awesome

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,400
will this make me look awesome dev lots

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,140
of clients even big corporates don't

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,300
understand dev they don't understand the

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,040
technical side of it so their concern is

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,540
is this going to work I have no idea in

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,380
this space is it going to be faster

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,360
they're going to be gone

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,910
are they doing it the right way I don't

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,090
know so value out there in terms of

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,200
communicating that custom components can

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,780
I have something unique I've got this

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,820
idea for really helping clients

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,610
understand what we do or finding this

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,200
information easily can I have something

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,650
custom on my site that my competitors

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,720
don't have yo xui for them as Willis

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,230
convert am I gonna make more sales is it

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,880
going to work training and handover can

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,950
we manage this in-house I'm investing

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,320
all this money and the last website we

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,820
had we can't update anything without

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,550
calling the web company this is a

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,870
massive concern and a huge value at if

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,150
you can speak to the problem of the

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,320
client in terms of yes you'll be able to

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,210
manage this in-house as long as we

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,860
invest the time in making sure that

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,580
we've set the backend up properly for

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,110
you and lastly the strategy making sure

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,820
the investment going to be worth it so

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,680
being able to show that they're gonna

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,840
get ROI on it because we've laid some

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,520
foundations that are based on real facts

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,620
and real data and real user information

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,090
there's one other big value-added I

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,010
think that's often overlooked by

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,720
agencies but clients in particular and

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:58,180
that's this giving a so the

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,160
attention to detail in projects and

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,990
having an in-depth understanding of the

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,120
client and business and the objectives

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,710
and having the whole team across that

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,130
and having the whole team invested in

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,680
outcomes takes time and time equals

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,670
money this was a huge realization for me

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,230
in the early days because I was in what

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,660
many people probably in this room will

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,700
recognize freelance hell which was I'm a

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,750
massive people pleaser I want everyone

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,330
to think I'm awesome and I want to

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,190
deliver at a high level and I was

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,900
working on clients that didn't

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,520
understand that and didn't value that

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,020
and weren't paying enough for me to be

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,330
able to spend the time or the energy

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,260
that's involved in really giving a

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,180
and so that was a big problem and you

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,250
need budget to be able to have time to

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,530
care is my point and I think it's really

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,970
important for clients to understand that

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,410
too it's a big part of our education

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,600
with clients that pixel Palace is that

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,410
in terms of value it's a hard thing to

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,470
put a

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,149
dollar price on but it does add to the

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,709
success of the project it adds to how

00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,269
fun it is to work on the project

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,970
throughout with the company that you're

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:05,509
working on and you know it really speaks

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:08,149
to that value-based pricing so the other

00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,430
bit of a high value site is this whole

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,160
thing of custom versus template and I

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,990
think there's a real need for some

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,389
education I think it's getting better

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,100
I've seen some awesome stuff too this

00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,230
weekend on some of the custom stuff I

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,819
know I loved Alex from frame all the

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,680
stuff you're doing an ACF with you guys

00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:27,740
so that's what we're doing too and I

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,329
think lots of people in the public or

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,300
even in marketing don't understand

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:35,540
what's possible in a custom WordPress

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,980
this topic came from a at the time and

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,029
they put the call out for speakers for

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,769
this and I was trying to think of a

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,129
topic to submit I had an interaction

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,480
with a new marketing manager at a

00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,680
potential new client that we were

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,100
looking to work with they're a big a

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,569
nice boutique alcohol brand and we've

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,839
been in talks with infer about six

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:55,430
months working out the project this

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,050
someone in the c-suite had worked with

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,490
us on another project at another company

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,069
and was really really impressed and

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,389
really wanted us and the new marketing

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:04,970
manager got hired internally at their

00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,160
end and came on board and she rang me on

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,380
her second day and said I don't want to

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,230
I don't want to use you guys and I'm

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,779
like okay I'm great that's been six

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,079
months of talking to these people okay

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,899
why because I don't want WordPress so

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,279
okay all right so why don't you want

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,589
WordPress because I don't want a

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,850
template I don't want this has to look

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,660
amazing I don't want a template I was

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,459
like oh my god

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,620
so we spent 40 minutes of me trying to

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,139
educate her she really don't want to

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,939
listen and we pulled the plug I'm not

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,439
working on this if you literally can

00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,720
come into a company this size and not

00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:40,069
understand the difference between custom

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,630
versus template and also what is

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:46,069
possible then we are not working

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,839
together so done finished so I think

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,680
there's a huge amount of Education I

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,870
thought this would be a good thing to

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,939
talk on especially because I know a lot

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,769
of the work camp attendees are marketing

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,209
people or maybe not high-level Deb's

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,910
that are working in big enterprise

00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,589
WordPress companies you know you might

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,180
be freelancers or you might be marketing

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,800
or content or business owners and you

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,089
might not realize that there's so much

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,999
you can do in a custom

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,290
WordPress it's amazing so other some of

00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,600
the other bits that are really cool

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,610
about custom stuff is being able to

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
strategically design so we start with a

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,290
blank figma file on every job we start

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,749
from scratch which lets us design

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,870
something strategic you know great user

00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:25,249
experience great user interface it can

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,290
have the marketing message we can do

00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,939
really creative stuff we can think about

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,410
mobile we can think about user journeys

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,839
and all that stuff we're not jamming

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:36,410
things into a preset thing we can pretty

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,660
much the world is our oyster the other

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,069
bit of it is you know a custom build

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,579
there's nothing you don't need super

00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,649
light

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,910
really we don't pile in a HIPAA plugins

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,740
trying to make stuff happen you're not

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,050
probably in a theme that's got a whole

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,430
heap of stuff that you don't need so you

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,029
know more secure like we've heard over

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,160
the weekend but also just faster another

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,990
big value add in these bigger sites is

00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,360
the streamlined administration in a

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,420
custom site again the stuff that Alex

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,949
was talking about with ACF that's hugely

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,389
valuable most clients when we deliver

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:08,329
them one of these sites to them with

00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:09,800
that built into it their minds blown or

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,509
what they can do with dragging stuff

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,129
around and adding new rows and adding

00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,920
new pages with a page builder type

00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,779
functionality that they can't break in

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,620
the look of their custom design that we

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:24,079
designed for them that takes time and a

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,870
lot of planning to get it well done and

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,759
well executed and then execute but it's

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,339
super super valuable because the time

00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,660
spent by administration in-house at

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,209
these big companies with marketing teams

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,980
that might change over all the time it's

00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,170
exponentially expensive if they can't

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,420
use it properly and hand on that

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,579
knowledge easily and then the last bit

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,749
is custom components so this is one of

00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,189
them if I'm going to dive into a bit and

00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:48,410
just show you some of the stuff that we

00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:51,259
have done over the last few years in our

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,660
custom WordPress sites it's things like

00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,009
directories and listings membership

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,839
directories and paid membership

00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,120
directories complex content management

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,389
using taxonomy and custom post types and

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,480
ACF highly filterable content on the

00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:07,670
front end complex gravity stuff and then

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,149
again the customized admin and custom

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:14,029
page builder functionality so some

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,589
examples this actually the site it's

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,970
really quite old it's one of our really

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,840
old ones but I think it's a really great

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,480
example of

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,400
something that we built where the value

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,340
is greater than the sum of the parts

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,610
because this was a directory for RSPCA

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:32,720
it's part of their choose wisely org dot

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:34,820
au site which is a listing of venues

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
that you can make you can search for a

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,630
venue or restaurant cafe if you want to

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,880
go somewhere that has humane food

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,750
choices so has humane eggs or chicken

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,340
whatever so it's a geolocation directory

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,320
which they had before they had a clunky

00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,770
old one but it worked was just a plugin

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,820
into a theme so we went back

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,170
custom-designed

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,520
the interface of that but the biggest

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,920
bit that I want to talk about today was

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,500
the submission of a business listing so

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,660
we created a simple gravity form it's

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,610
nothing it's nothing that crazy where

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,150
people can submit all of the details of

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,710
the business venue and at the bottom

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,480
it's got questions about their food

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,060
choices so they can choose you know yes

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,650
we do the eggs yes we don't do we don't

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,770
use him and chicken but we do use humane

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,060
pork submit off it goes to our SPCA what

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,920
that does in the backend is create a

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,540
draft listing in the directory so it's

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,700
actually creating a post in the custom

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,190
post type with all of that stuff already

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,570
formatted ready to be published straight

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,780
into the directory with no one touching

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,550
anything and then our SPCA get the

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,740
notification saying someone's supplied

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,270
the admin logs in they go check the

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,920
listing and just check that it's all

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,300
legit they might ring them but more

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,130
often than not they can see from online

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,450
that it's all okay

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,010
and the biggest bit is the commitment

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,930
section so this bit down the bottom here

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,640
we're asked the questions in the backend

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,680
it lets our SPCA the biggest problem a

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,110
had in admin was that they

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,250
time-consuming Lea had to research

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,830
whether or not people check the right

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,780
boxes and it was legit and then manually

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,950
set up the listing in the website now

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,870
they can just see what the answer for

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,840
those questions and tick the box either

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,130
they're on the way or humane food all

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,920
the way which means they're completely

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,820
compliant or they're only half compliant

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,920
publish and that's straight into the

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,450
directory the ones that are humane food

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,950
all the way get the highlighted listing

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,400
because in the green and the other ones

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,350
just plain listings in order of

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,110
geolocation closest to wherever you

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,210
searched so super simple but added a

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:31,040
huge amount of value to the RSPCA team

00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,760
in terms of admin so it's pretty cool

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,430
and

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,639
example was this site that we built mid

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,889
last year its massive content African

00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,620
safari site multilingual in German

00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:44,600
English just to add to the complexity

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,949
it's basically features a lot of

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,750
interactive and complex content

00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:50,750
management using taxonomy and custom

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,459
post types and categories so this site

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:57,529
has sections for safaris accommodation

00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,149
listings countries/regions training

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,070
adventures and all of the content

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,510
cross-pollinate in both languages across

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,190
all different parts of the site so you

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:09,260
can pull in content from everywhere

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,519
basically using the categories and

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,199
taxonomy and stuff so it also features a

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,790
really cool custom element one other

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,220
custom element says heap there's too

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,170
many to go into today but this one was

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,660
cool so this is on the home page and

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:28,040
it's an interactive SVG map of Africa

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,139
where you can select the area of the

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,420
region of Africa and get a quick link

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:35,269
into some details about it so in the

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,459
backend this is an ACF row and you can

00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,690
just select you turn on maybe a so all

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,100
the regions that are in that map are

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,959
actually set up in the backend ready to

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,569
go so the client could just tick it live

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,670
and fill in the the top pick selections

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:48,139
from a selector in the ACF the rest is

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,589
automated published and it's straight

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:53,569
live to the site so again so simple I

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,250
mean it's not that simple as a bit of

00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:58,370
JavaScript and the SVG stuff but it's a

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,230
simple idea but it's the strategy behind

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,300
it and the forward thinking about how

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,780
this might benefit the client and users

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,669
for a long time to come so this site

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,400
also has a really cute little it's just

00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:13,850
an example of a gravity form interactive

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,280
inquiry form so again nothing that crazy

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,709
but just use a slider and gravity forms

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,209
but it's a much more engaging way to

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,860
capture inquiries for the business

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,069
rather than just you know call to action

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,210
fill in our form so yeah just little

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,669
bits and pieces like that that are

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:36,169
creative coffee beans but those have

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:38,510
seen me at work camp the last couple of

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:41,600
times it's not work camp unless I talk

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,740
about coffee beans delivered this is my

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,670
baby with my husband

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,700
it's an ecommerce store that we start

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,350
about for nearly five years ago now over

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,820
one weekend over a beer thought it was a

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,900
good idea since we could build an

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,450
e-commerce site that we should hmm

00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,280
yeah it's turned out okay but it's now

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,080
its own beast it's its own company it

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,490
has five staff my husband works at full

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,900
time we have an espresso bar a

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,720
distribution center and it's probably

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:11,010
one of the up top online retail artisan

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,580
coffee sites on in Australia so yeah it

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,920
went well but yeah yeah right that's

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,990
another story but anyway this is a great

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,180
example of something custom as well so

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,790
on this site we found that people are

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,980
having trouble deciding on what coffee

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,470
they should buy there's lots of choices

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,760
and they weren't sure so we came up with

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,530
this idea for this interactive quiz

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,590
which is basically just using a gravity

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,660
form again and some custom graphics and

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,860
obviously some front-end stuff but it

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,870
lets people go through and select their

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,150
preferences about what machine use stuff

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:49,770
like that personality types is just a

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,030
kind of cute one Bri my answer gives you

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,100
a little different thing every time you

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,830
get this page and then it pops out

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,390
basically a coffee personality so

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,870
they're all different depending on what

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,750
you picked which is shareable on social

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,730
media and they're really really funny

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,740
but these are three products selected

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,440
specifically like a line to what you

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,300
selected in that quiz so it's real if

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,540
you'd selected milk then ill Carmelo is

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,820
a fantastic blend for you and also you

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,810
said you drank more than two one or two

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,490
a day see you probably going to need a

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,930
kilo and you need whole beans because

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,720
you said you had a grinder so the

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,450
product selection simple right gravity

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,750
forms custom post type WooCommerce and a

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,970
whole lot of really complex like matrix

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,870
of the face like this this is who says

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,460
it lands here but nothing too crazy in

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,890
terms of functionality the value was in

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,360
the thinking and the strategy on it and

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,010
it was super valuable because we found

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,600
that once we launched this about it was

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,690
about six months after we launched the

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,910
site we implemented this and if people

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,250
go through the quiz that the conversion

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,330
rate was 200 times what it was without

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,990
the quiz so it also on a side because

00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,970
it's a gravity for

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,320
the data gets stored in the gravity form

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,250
in the backend so although this doesn't

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,410
look like a form and you're not

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,940
submitting anything you actually are so

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,580
we have collected a great amount of

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,679
really useful user data on our customers

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,030
if they're logged in to the site into

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,679
the WooCommerce as well it stores

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,059
against their customer records so we can

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,850
see what machine they have and stuff

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:19,440
like that if they've done the quiz so we

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,200
use that data for marketing directly to

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,580
them about things specific to them

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,920
sorry that's custom components I could

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,760
talk all day on custom components

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,760
actually really love it's one of the

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,090
bits I love about what we do but the

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,100
other big big important bit here in

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,550
terms of value is strategy it's really

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,309
scary

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,590
jumping into something of high value and

00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,809
not feeling like there's a strategy and

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,580
I've seen that before we started doing

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,440
strategic marketing we'd often see big

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,970
companies come to us and they need a

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,040
website and they have budget and stuff

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,900
but you start digging and realized they

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,010
actually had no plan for the web no

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,790
digital plan they might have at a

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:02,580
marketing plan but no actual real plan

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,870
so having a plan a good marketing

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,880
strategy but also a plan for the website

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,010
is absolutely crucial in making things

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,510
work small or big but if you're

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,370
investing this much money when you're up

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,770
in this level of thing then a plan is

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,150
absolutely vital so it's things like

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,040
having a marketing plan and a brand

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,410
strategy you know the obvious stuff

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,380
understanding your market and your

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,790
target market and how to speak to them

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,730
yeah it's easy to assume that you their

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,070
clients know why they want a website but

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:31,470
really more from not don't just

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,750
frightening the other bit is you know

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,320
ux/ui taking the strategy and turning it

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,790
into a really good design that works so

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,040
we also find here really good value out

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,870
as anything we can do to get the client

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,179
really focused on the user at this point

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,340
so that's things like user goals and

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,390
journey mapping content canvases aligned

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,020
with their business goals and all that

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,360
sort of stuff

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,730
is part of what we wrap into a package

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,530
on a higher value site like that because

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,390
we don't want to work on anything that's

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:02,640
not going to work it doesn't feel good

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,530
architectures the other thing so along

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,030
with planning it's about looking at

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,590
audience research so looking at real

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,030
data if they've got an existing site

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,410
we'll look at you know how's that

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,460
performing what are the top pages where

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,230
are people going

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,450
where are they dropping off all that

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,790
sort of stuff and use that to plan the

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,830
new one it's really great to show that

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,090
to clients because it adds massive value

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,950
when you're starting to talk about real

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,970
data and not just abstract assumptions

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,320
on things then also it's about

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,870
considering how WordPress is going to

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,940
handle the project so we do spend a lot

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:35,370
of time and this is pre build pre design

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,400
pre content pre final content a lot of

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,770
the times a lot of time planning and the

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,600
structure and laying the groundwork in

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,820
foundations for things like the custom

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,380
post types and taxonomies and how things

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,090
are going to feed into how things going

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,460
to pull across all different parts of

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,660
the site and also the backend

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,790
architecture how we're going to build

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,230
this so people can manage it what's

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,760
going to be the best way to future-proof

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,740
it for them so that they get a really

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,940
good clear run at this themselves

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,380
without having to come back and get help

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,550
so the other big piece here is

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,800
understanding value and selling on value

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,030
it's a tough one in this space because

00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,020
you do get people that just go I want to

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,310
know how long it's going to take you and

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,530
I only want to pay you that and that's

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,420
not right that's not right the there's

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,760
so much this this is such a complex part

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,680
of this whole thing I'm really

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
fascinated by it actually there's a few

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,890
things that go into this though that

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,290
make this whole thing more than a

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,210
website relationships matter when you're

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,380
embarking on a massive high-value site

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,210
like this it's a bit of time and in a

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,620
team Outsiders like when we were three

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,050
people and we were doing sites this size

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,000
it's a massive investment we are all in

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,980
that whole team is all-in and all over

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,350
this whole thing so the relationship

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,210
with the client is so important to

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,800
having it work and feel good and

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,960
maintain the momentum and to feel good

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,580
about it and anyone in agency will know

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,870
how quickly I don't even freelancers

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,030
everyone that works with clients will

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,200
know how quickly a client's attitude or

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,780
their communication style the

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,100
relationship can just put a big downer

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,320
on the whole thing and make you not want

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,910
to work on it anymore I have this

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,590
analogy that everyone laughs at but I

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,450
think it's a good one that embarking on

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,430
a decent-sized web project with an

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,700
agency is like choosing a baby daddy

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,960
because basically you're you're choosing

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,670
to have a child together that you're

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,020
going to raise for some amount of time

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,110
together whether it's just getting that

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,790
thing born or if it's raising

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,559
to go off to college and be successful

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,440
and make lots of money and support you

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,820
into your old age and I think you need

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,650
to choose it carefully like choosing

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,570
based on whether you feel a synergy with

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,820
this thing and you trust the agency and

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,470
you trust the people and vice versa I'm

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,270
so picky about the clients we work with

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,790
because I have a small team to protect

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,320
the energy of and I want it to always I

00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,390
want Monday's to feel great that pixel

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,730
palace so the relationship matters

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:55,700
communication major factor way a lot of

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,440
projects fail and I think again that

00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,480
feeds back into the relationships but it

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,120
adds to value if an agency communicates

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,500
really well that is valuable and

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,290
something that probably doesn't get

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,040
talked about enough in terms of shopping

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,240
around and trying to shop on price price

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,250
won't matter when you're not getting an

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,330
answer from people or you feel like

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,840
you're just not getting what you need

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,880
it's the worst systems and processes so

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,919
you need systems and processes if you're

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,900
working on big sites so things stay on

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,870
track and on budget and avoid scope

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,090
creep things will fall over if you don't

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,340
have processes in place having processes

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,620
and systems takes time and budget and

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:38,690
experience so again it's adding to the

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:40,549
value price versus cost yeah so this is

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,929
this is a great one because people shop

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,830
on price on websites for some crazy

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:47,809
reason I just can't I don't know I don't

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,400
understand it's kind of like shopping on

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:50,900
price on a car I get any four you can

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,040
afford is a $500 car because that's

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,049
where you can afford an you need a car

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,450
and I think fit for purpose and all that

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,220
stuff but what you buy for $500 is not

00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,900
what you buy for ten thousand dollars or

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,059
fifty thousand dollars and they're

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,590
people understand that in that analogy

00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,740
but they don't seem to understand it in

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,419
Webb so it's about taking a client from

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,280
a low expectation of budget because they

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:12,679
don't understand all this stuff that I'm

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,720
talking about and moving them through

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,580
their education to understand that

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,100
sometimes the cost of a website is

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,780
invisible like sometimes you can't tell

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,320
how much these things cost in you in

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,890
lost opportunity or time wasted or not

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,950
converting and you know paying a couple

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,360
of grand to get it designed and built is

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,160
nothing compared to what you're losing

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,280
from not having done all this and other

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,059
stuff in the background so it's a tough

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,129
one

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:43,879
and then charging for value rather than

00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:45,200
time so you know if you employ an agency

00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:47,479
like pixel palace or some of the other

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,979
sort of agencies in the space you're

00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:53,779
employing experience and speed and

00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:55,940
expertise and you're you're buying on

00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,789
outcomes you're not buying on well it's

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,369
going to take us 40 hours to do that you

00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,719
know it's our experiences come from

00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,549
years and years and years of doing this

00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:07,070
stuff over and over and seeing it all so

00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,509
we can be quick and awesome and we know

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,710
how to quickly jump in and do something

00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,659
and we have things in place to be able

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,149
to roll stuff out really quickly that's

00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,619
valuable it's that thing of you know you

00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,359
go the dentist and he tells you it's

00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:19,879
gonna be $500 to pull that tooth out and

00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,379
it's hurting you you don't argue with

00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:23,119
him so it's only gonna take you 10

00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,679
seconds to pull that tooth out I'm only

00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,529
going to pay you for the 10 seconds no

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,559
you're paying for the whole thing it's

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:33,349
like value-based value-based rather than

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,239
time base and then just coming back to

00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:37,489
the thing of giving a is valuable

00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,989
giving a is valuable that's the bit

00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,080
for me and I think it's just so

00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:44,599
intangible but it's it getting a team or

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,830
a freelancer who cares is worth paying

00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:50,570
for and if you think it's expensive to

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:55,159
hire professional wait until you're

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,749
hiring amateur now it's so tough in this

00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,399
space because I do believe if you pay

00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,539
peanuts you generally get monkeys you

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,789
might luck it out and get something

00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:03,649
really awesome and but that poor

00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,879
developer or freelancer is probably

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:08,509
dying

00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:10,460
conversely I'm all about not selling to

00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,909
clients who shouldn't spend big money

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,070
for something I'm definitely a massive

00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:18,440
fit for purpose is my thing all about

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,359
fit for purpose so there's a range of

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,309
options out there in this space you can

00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,049
get a site for five hundred dollars you

00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,320
can get a site for a hundred thousand

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,229
dollars

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,719
they're both websites and everything is

00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:31,309
okay the lower end of things is okay too

00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:32,869
if that's what you can afford and that's

00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,279
what you can do then that's okay but

00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:37,309
it's about understanding that what you

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:39,440
get for that is less experience less

00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:41,419
care less time less speed less

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,940
technically sound that's okay as long as

00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,499
you're aware it's like the car thing if

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,639
you can only afford the $500 car you

00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,830
know you're not getting something

00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:51,020
terribly safe or long-lasting but you're

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,550
okay because you understand

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,200
we've probably all seen examples of this

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,880
like the client has spent $800 on our

00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,230
website and then is immediately redoing

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,640
it again because they realize that was

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,470
just so stupid and it doesn't even work

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,070
properly and they may have gone to the

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:06,200
pub with that $800 and they want to at

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,220
that point all the clients who cut out

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,840
the two interesting bits of

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,280
functionality that we propose on a

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,080
website to make it different and

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,429
actually convert for them because of

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,900
budget but then they just hope like a

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:17,030
boring our site that they could have

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,830
just had a template and you know they

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,190
look like everyone else and they had a

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,900
chance to really get ahead or clients

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,220
conversely who pay too much we had one

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,790
client come to us a couple years ago

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:34,130
that had spent $40,000 on a Envato

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:38,420
template and yeah and so that terrifies

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:42,380
me and it's just awful so it's about fit

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,120
for purpose so basically that's the

00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,650
takeaway through today that I would like

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,780
you to take from my talk if anything

00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,280
there's five things one there needs to

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,620
be a plan I think it needs to be a plan

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,210
regardless of budget but the more time

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,290
the more budget you have the more time

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:58,940
you have the better plan you can have

00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,770
WordPress can be greater than the sum of

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,420
its parts I'm yet to see something we

00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,590
can't do with the custom WordPress like

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:09,050
you can do some cool so I love

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:12,350
WordPress for that and if anyone tries

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,090
to tell me otherwise next the

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,040
architecture the admin and the backend

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,150
adds a huge amount of value and this is

00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,440
something people don't talk about enough

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,520
but it really should be if you're a

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,850
marketing manager and you're getting

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,440
quotes on websites like talking about

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,200
what how the backend architecture is

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,120
going to be set up is really really

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,040
important relationships matter

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,360
relationships for me and communication

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,890
is the biggest thing in my business it's

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,750
the reason why pixel power always has

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,700
done well because I'm a communicator I'm

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,340
a people person I might not be the best

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,800
designer I'm definitely not developer

00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,540
but I understand people and I know how

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,090
to communicate well so I manage

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,230
relationships well and that is of

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,580
massive I think you could talk to anyone

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,140
that pixel Palace has worked with in the

00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,610
last 10 years and that would be the

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,410
number one thing they say at the end of

00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,670
a project at the beginning I was scared

00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,990
of spending the money this was at you

00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,669
were three times more expensive than

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,640
some of the other quotes I got for 10

00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:03,970
times more expensive but oh my god in a

00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,860
heartbeat do it again I wish

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,120
I knew that at the beginning and so and

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,550
I have this thing too I'm always like if

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,080
you knew what I know you'd be fine with

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,410
it you'd be like shut up and take my

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,390
money so relationships and communication

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,280
is everything in that space and then

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,520
value is not all about the time it takes

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,500
like the dentist so that's a really

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,950
important thing I think for everyone

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,660
freelancers as well as potential clients

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,310
or if you're in the market for a website

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,610
the understanding that the value is not

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,380
about the time it takes that's it got

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,710
time for questions

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:45,269
[Music]

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:45,269
[Applause]

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,180
we've got time for a few questions I

00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:57,040
believe so if you could come down the

00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,590
front we will have some microphones and

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,740
yeah thanks again Jen that was awesome

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,740
talk

00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:22,039
thank you so much I love that I love the

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,929
slides are awesome in your stories um

00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,429
you talked about communicating are you

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,869
to your clients what's the best way to

00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:30,019
do that so do you tell them horror

00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:32,239
stories about that $40,000 website built

00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:35,709
on a template or data how do you

00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:37,789
communicate the value and bruh I think

00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:40,219
onboarding of quite like the initial

00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:43,279
first few conversations with clients was

00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:46,429
super important and I think also in that

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,039
space the energy that you come at relate

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,839
like again I'm naturally really good

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,819
with people so I naturally do this thing

00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,129
where you can see I'm being authentic

00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,659
when I talk to you about what we do and

00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:59,059
what the value is in that and I believe

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:00,319
that so people feel it I think it's

00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:02,899
really hard to have that conversation if

00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,190
you don't believe the value yourself so

00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,199
that's probably one thing is really

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,549
getting clear within yourself if you're

00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:09,949
having these conversations with people

00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:11,479
like that you value it and that you're

00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,799
not going on it's not really worth it

00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:15,139
because a minute you feel like that then

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,789
they're going to feel that too but yeah

00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:18,289
like it depends on the situation it

00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,119
depends on the client sometimes it's

00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,799
great to say if they've got a really low

00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,589
budget expectation because someone else

00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,299
has quoted you know ten grand and we're

00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:28,190
saying this is 40 and literally

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:30,019
genuinely if we're saying it's that then

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,379
I'm telling you that it needs to be that

00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,429
like this isn't so I think yeah I think

00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,719
it's a two thing I think it's

00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,249
confidently believing that it's worth

00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:38,779
that and understanding the value and

00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,729
then working out a way to clearly

00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:43,190
communicate that in the right every

00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:46,219
client has a different fear I guess that

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,259
early bit yeah so understanding their

00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:52,789
problem and trying to help them solve it

00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:55,369
this is probably yeah thank you it's a

00:33:52,789 --> 00:34:00,349
great great talk for these feature-rich

00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:05,299
sites who owns the IP of those features

00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:07,549
you or the client I they they own what

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,460
we did for them that's not to say that

00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:12,649
we can't go and build something with a

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,679
similar setup for someone else

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:18,589
we never ever have copied exactly from

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,029
one to another because all of our sites

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,079
are custom like in any way and you know

00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:22,039
if you look through our portfolio you

00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,569
see they're all completely different

00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,859
there's not one that looks like oh yeah

00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:28,070
they've kind of gone oh yeah that's the

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:31,220
same thing totally different so

00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,810
yeah I mean those clients own their

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,120
thing yeah I can do what they want with

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,040
that um there's no restriction I last as

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,500
far as I'm aware or concerned that we

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,790
can't go and do the same sort of bill

00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,710
because if they're all iterations are

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,750
the same thing yeah yeah yeah so then

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,510
fine following question from that if

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,710
someone wanted you know another agency

00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,770
wouldn't to come along and say oh that

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:54,500
choose wisely functionality love it can

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,940
i buy it you do sell nothing well

00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,890
there's nothing in that so that's the

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,130
beauty of that right and like it's

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,960
literally a gravity form and a custom

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,270
post type that creates the draft post we

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,920
didn't write that that's like so I think

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,470
there's a part of this too that's like

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,910
we some of that functionality is built

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:16,340
using premium plugins we try not to use

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,050
plugins unnecessarily but some of that

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,760
big the heavy lifting is done by things

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:25,340
like what ICF obviously but Gio my

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,390
wordpress and facet WP and those sort

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,670
things like there's no need to reinvent

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,830
the wheel on it so all of that stuff is

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,150
basically strategic use of plugins

00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,010
together and some of the native

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,140
WordPress stuff like custom post types

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,730
and taxonomies and things like that if

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,290
there's nothing proprietary and it we

00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,420
haven't done anything that we did that

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,810
we couldn't do with a plug-in almost you

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,520
and some clever stuff so so yeah and

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,700
there's a different question

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,670
communicating with your clients do you

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,400
just do that over email and phone or do

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,510
you insist on a certain wide oh yeah

00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,120
that's a good one

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,130
emails horrible I think things go

00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,130
pear-shaped on email so damn quickly

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,780
it's not funny so I think a lot of

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,190
clients are happy to rage on an email as

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,780
well but they don't tend to rage when

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,070
you pick up the phone and I feel like a

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,160
lot of creatives in particular are

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,650
really scared of that phone call but I

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,150
mentor a lot of other designers and sort

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,560
of startups and the creative thing and

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,300
I'm always say let me get comfy with

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,950
these conversations get comfy with the

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,600
uncomfortable conversations because what

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,760
I found over 10 years of doing this is

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,160
that clients love me because I have

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,450
boundaries and I say no that's a really

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,610
great idea but no we're not doing that

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,170
because it's out of scope and it'll take

00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,360
us another three days to do and but we

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,830
can do it I can quote on it blah blah

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,270
blah but that's a phone call not an

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,650
email they get an email on that and

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:44,950
they're like pissed off so I am deaf

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,680
a phone call girl or a meeting we have

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,630
found to presenting designs the first

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,940
time to clients in particular where

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,730
there's multiple stakeholders in person

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,529
or at least on a zoom so I can watch

00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,420
them because I watch their face I know

00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:59,289
and I can find I've got a spidey sense

00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,819
that my team will tell you it's

00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,900
hilarious I'll predict I can tell you

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:04,000
what their feedbacks gonna be before

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,359
they send it and every time it's like ah

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,819
yeah so yeah but being there and

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,260
presenting in person lets you talk them

00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:13,869
through the stuff that's so easy to make

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,970
assumptions that people know everything

00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,770
that we know and you know you've been

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,020
working on a design a complex design for

00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,339
a big corporate site for ages and you

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,390
just send that off to them and we've got

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,650
all these assumptions because we've been

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,970
looking at it yeah like that's gonna be

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,200
sticky so when they scroll it's gonna

00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,150
stay there then you send them a thing

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,380
and you send some notes that I read that

00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,029
those are sort of the things that I like

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,770
was there a big blood of a bluebird blue

00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:34,210
and then they're upset already aware is

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,410
you don't present that you talk them

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,770
through this or something and they're

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,589
like this is amazing so again it's the

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,779
giving a ship part it's that bit of yes

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:45,130
it's easier to fire off a PDF or send

00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:46,690
them a link to the figment of a comment

00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,089
on or whatever it is that you do is your

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,529
process but there's huge value in

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,900
stopping and taking time to actually

00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:54,069
cuddle them and say let's talk this

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,779
through I want to show you my enthusiasm

00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:57,430
and what we thought and the thinking

00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:58,839
behind it that we had strategy and this

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,329
is why we did this and imagine when it

00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:02,980
does this and you get final first pop we

00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:05,079
get sign-off first pop on most things

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,359
that we send big things because we can't

00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:12,869
do that so great all right thank you for

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:16,980
listening thanks again Jen that was a

00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:20,260
great talk I'm sure we're all going to

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,599
ask you pay everyone to the person next

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,700
to you to give you $50,000 to build more

00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,500
website it's gotta be worth it

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,950
everywhere but is there another question

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,950
that's secret are we done

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,500
yeah I was just wondering how far do you

00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:41,380
get through scoping before you give the

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,299
quote of this will be $50,000 yeah yeah

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,760
so these big sites definitely often have

00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:47,710
a pane scoping so we'll do a workshop

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,230
where we if they can't give us a very

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,770
detailed brief so one big one that we're

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,200
working on currently

00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,420
the marketing girl at that place is

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,000
amazing and detailed and has the most

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,190
amazing like everything done brief

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,350
amazing content done all ready to go

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,850
very easy for us to just go bang that's

00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,250
how much that is but more often than not

00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:09,140
these big corporates in particular have

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,610
no idea so we say we'll go and spend a

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,960
day or two days or whatever it is

00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,360
working with your marketing team or

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,910
working whoever it is their thing to

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,900
come up with the plan and from that plan

00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,640
they'll come out of it with an

00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,280
architecture for the site perhaps and a

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,750
contents like here's the pages and the

00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,710
architecture here's a content canvas

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,090
that you can go and start thinking about

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,220
content on do you need help with content

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:31,400
do you need a marketing plan do you need

00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,260
you know so from that if they if they

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,490
have no idea and we can't see clearly

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,190
what the scope is because we do

00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,900
fixed-price we're not doing you know

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,610
it's it's this is the cost of this site

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,350
to this scope if we can't see that

00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,940
clearly then I won't provider a quote

00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:49,340
and they have to do that otherwise we're

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:52,880
out yeah sweet oh thanks again Jen
