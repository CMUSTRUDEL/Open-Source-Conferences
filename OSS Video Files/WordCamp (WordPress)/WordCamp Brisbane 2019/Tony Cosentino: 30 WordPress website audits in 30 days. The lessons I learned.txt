[Applause]

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,929
thank you very much and we're still

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,110
getting enough for what here at the back

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,480
okay

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:19,289
awesome I was born in Queensland I might

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:22,920
have you know okay so I'm going to talk

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,390
about 30 WordPress audits that I did in

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,369
30 days and the kind of lessons that

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,970
I've learned but before we get into that

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,079
I want to find out a little bit about

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,460
you guys so who in the room have been

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:40,890
exposed to WordPress for less than one

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,989
year well it's a good mix there how

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,989
about one to five years

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,820
okay how about more than five years okay

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,180
if I look around these are all the

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,410
people that got trapped here because

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,690
there's only one track the event

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,399
sessions that open yet and they didn't

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,760
get to the door in time before I started

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,850
so no now there's more pressure on me to

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,720
get the facts straight than before so

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,720
bear with me okay

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,869
Tony cousin Tina as you know the WP

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,210
guide at comdata use we can find me

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,950
saying with Instagram it's a little tip

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,689
you can use your website address with

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,659
your Instagram name with the dots and

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,360
everything makes it super easy

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,270
Facebook's the WP guy right so a little

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,890
bit of a walk through of my timeline so

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:41,100
in 2008 I started an Internet

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,259
communications degree and blogging I

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,229
think was a subject and WordPress came

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,549
up we had to go and find WordPress and

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:53,130
install it and at the same time I had a

00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,720
I think a friend of my sister that

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,570
needed a website for their hairdressing

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,790
so on and I thought I think I could use

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,750
WordPress to kind of do this so I just

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,810
had a go at setting them up and they

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,569
loved it and that kind of sparks the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:15,620
beginning of building websites for money

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:18,150
so I was I don't know fun starts 2011 I

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,709
decided to ramp it up and I went got on

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,810
a plane I went to New Zealand to my

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,140
first word camp and it was just

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,329
mind-blowing like I had people who work

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,400
for automatic there there were people

00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:33,299
that built plugins there that I had

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,590
actually heard of and this great regular

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,260
community of people as well that would

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,060
just all you know amazing so enjoy

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,849
thoroughly soaked it up and enjoyed it

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,489
and then came back to Australia and then

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,489
went to another word came that the same

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,700
year in Melbourne and I got up and did a

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,959
lightning talk on my five favorite

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,220
plugins so if you get a chance to do a

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,200
lightning talk I suggest you have a go

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,310
at that too it's a lot of fun and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,480
there's no pressure you can just get up

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:06,000
and talk and then in 2012 I decided to

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,379
speak at Sydney WordCamp about every

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,439
plugin Under the Sun that I'd kind of

00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,180
come across and it was a shocker I'm

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,940
still getting over that presentation if

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,870
please I go and look at it it's somewhat

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,729
online still but because of that I I

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,440
didn't really get back to doing speaking

00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,919
until last year I had a little place

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,799
traumatic stress from that that last one

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:31,319
so but I came back here last year and

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
spoke about podcasts and using WordPress

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,970
and I've got some nice feedback and

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,220
Charlie sitting right here enjoyed it I

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,220
believe say hi Charlie

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,930
so here we are today talking about the

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,620
the lessons of Lent we're doing ordering

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,120
30 WordPress websites in 30 days right

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,729
something I love about WordPress though

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,079
just just to inspire anyone that's just

00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,659
new to WordPress is it can give you a

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,810
lot of things like freedom flexibility

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,439
financial security trying to be a great

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,139
dad for my kids the guy on the top left

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,489
is my oldest and he was on Australia's

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,859
Got Talent on Sundays magic Josh or hot

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,690
Josh got a nickname and he's he's going

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,500
to be on again tomorrow night in the

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,480
semi finals and you may see

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,340
coming out parents from my mohawk I

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,680
don't know yeah but I was there okay and

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,240
you get to meet some amazing people in

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,850
the WordPress community particularly

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,680
this lovely lady who will be speaking

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:42,490
later with open and closing word camp

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:49,180
for you today right so here's 30 common

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:51,040
mistakes that are worth noting right the

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,560
number I think the number one thing you

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,220
can do to make your website terrible is

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,860
get cheap hosting you think you're gonna

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,470
save money you're just starting up you

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,800
look for the $5 a month hosting you find

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,770
it and you start to grow and then you

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,040
realize that your emails are working

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,430
your site's super slow it's sometimes it

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,190
goes offline you can't get hold of any

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,830
wordpress any support staff i really

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,200
suggest thinking strongly about your

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,150
hosting it's and you blade we'll talk

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,790
about speed but host things are where

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,520
you can actually improve your speed the

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,930
most getting decent hosting the more

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,630
hosts the more people on a hosting

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,890
account cheap hosting the more people

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,710
that are fighting for the same server

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,330
processing speed and there's lots of

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:46,979
great hosting options outside some of

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:49,180
which of you I use so talk to them now

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,150
what I've gone is order than these sites

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,710
there's a lot of people that had the

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,710
defaults time zone set in their settings

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,500
at some of the general settings I think

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,330
and you can you can select not only you

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,540
know plus ten for Brisbane but you can

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,760
select your city so that if you're in a

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,620
state that has daylight savings it will

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,300
automatically adjust to the daylight

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,490
savings time it's kind of important to

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,860
know when comments come through when you

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,840
want to post something ahead of like

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,700
schedule a post that it comes out at the

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,600
right time so that's just an easy one to

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:29,289
get right that people often miss your

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,320
permit settings I still found a few

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,370
websites that had the old default

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,680
WordPress

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,060
family setting and the question like

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,650
vehicles watching Surry doesn't roll off

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,280
the tongue when trying to share a link

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,790
to somebody now my favorite is post name

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,370
but I know that people that build silos

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,350
of content prefer to have category and

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,380
then post them which is also a good

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,240
strategy and it doesn't affect standard

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,610
pages still come up as their page name

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,680
and if you've got if you're really

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,030
making it categories your blocks of

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,620
content that you want to promote then

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:09,820
you can use category post same as well

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:13,060
okay how many people know about this

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,160
setting how many people have never heard

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,900
of this discourage search engines from

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,830
indexing your site anyone not heard of

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,830
it good

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I've cut I've looked at websites someone

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,900
paid thirty thousand dollars for three

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,400
months previously and that setting was

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,630
still set to discourage search engines

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,770
it's so easy to miss because you when

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,669
you're building a site you want to hide

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:45,190
it from Google at the time and it gets

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:46,990
forgotten to switch back right hello

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:52,360
dolly is a great plug-in to show you how

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:55,090
plugins and structured but and I think

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,860
Matt Mullenweg actually his names on it

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,690
I don't know whether you wrote wrote it

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,010
but it it doesn't need to be there right

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,639
it's just a plug-in that's sitting there

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:09,039
doing nothing that you can delete right

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:11,770
to tighten up here your plugins and and

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,150
honestly I've found it probably about 25

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,780
percent of the websites still had it

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,419
sitting there too many plugins right so

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,500
this is opening comments were that I one

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,020
of the websites I came across had a

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,289
hundred plugins it really did have a

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:31,630
hundred plugins the scariest part was

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:33,039
only 50 of them were active so so

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,959
they're like a hundred attack vectors

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,440
for hackers to kind of look for weak

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,820
points to get into the web site so have

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,160
a real think about what plugins you use

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,960
and there's lots of options to any way

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,400
that like

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,850
some themes have options that you didn't

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,050
realize that can replace a plug-in and I

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,490
know we're gonna probably talk about

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,780
Gutenberg today but if you've got a

00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,040
visual builder theme and and you you

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,080
kind of want to switch off the Gutenberg

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,890
blocks to sort of let you just use that

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,110
visual builder tool in that building

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,640
your content a lot of them now have

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,250
introduced a setting which you can enter

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,990
classic editor mode automatically

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,490
without naming the plugin that you can

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,200
get to do that's there's little things

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,110
you can do to kind of streamline your

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:28,570
plug-in collection right so back to that

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,430
50 inactive plugins that that website

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,850
had if you've got inactive plugins

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,560
don't be a hoarder right don't it you

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,020
don't have to I know they're really

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,730
really handy you never know when you

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,420
might need it but if they're in the

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,980
plug-in directory you can install it you

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,120
can search for it and store it down the

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,680
track when you need it

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,120
don't just have it sitting there just in

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
case on a rainy day you might want to

00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:00,430
write old themes is a really common one

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:04,840
to have every default WordPress theme

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:08,530
since the website was built you don't

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,240
need to have every version of WordPress

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,920
the WordPress theme sitting in there or

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,810
themes that you've tried and decided

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,720
that you you're going with a particular

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:21,220
one have one thing as a fallback so you

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,770
can deactivate your main theme if you

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,740
have real issues to try and fault find

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,260
so 2019 I'd suggest having that because

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,480
it's the most current less chance of

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,270
having having bugs and issues and things

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:40,330
so don't have a thin graveyard in your

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:43,150
website child themes how many people

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:49,630
don't have a child theme on their

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:51,790
website it's not too bad I know that the

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,890
case now is that you can use custom CSS

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,330
and you don't need to have a child theme

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,890
but one day you might want to add some

00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,170
functions to the website and there's

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,620
also plugins for that but it's kind of

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:05,600
cleaner to have

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:08,300
child theme to add custom CSS to to add

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,370
functions and there's a couple of

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,670
plugins that are really good to do that

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,470
there's child theme wizard which you can

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,010
use to create a child theme up my

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,800
favorite is the child theme configurator

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,660
at the moment because it will analyze

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,670
the theme that you want to make a child

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,200
theme from and it will tell you whether

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,620
it's compatible with making a child

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,060
theme and it will also copy your things

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,250
like your menu and footer settings

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,830
across to the child theme so you don't

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:41,170
have to go and reallocate the main menu

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:44,720
stuff like that worth thinking about

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,820
right so I couldn't believe it these

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,500
websites serious websites that I looked

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,020
at that were commercial for commercial

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,680
yeast and though were definitely a

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,820
revenue generator and a lot didn't have

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,970
back up running they are that had no

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,160
backup plug-in installed whatsoever or

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,570
they had it installs and they had one

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,890
backup for when the website was built

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:13,880
and nothing since you need to do regular

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,170
backups preferably on a weekly basis but

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,700
it really depends if you don't move your

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,200
content around don't change your content

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,050
depends when you do updates and when you

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,540
do content updates in plug-in updates

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,990
and things like that so have a regular

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,040
update schedule and there's plenty of

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,960
options out there my favorite at the

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,620
moment is WP updraftplus

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,620
it's a free play in on the wordpress.org

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,360
repository it allows scheduling it

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,780
allows off-site backups they can send

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,690
copies of the backup to Amazon s3 which

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,700
is my favorite off off-site storage

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,920
option tech there's a little bit of pain

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,500
initially to set that up but it's worth

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,570
it it's very economical you you can use

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,740
Dropbox I think Dropbox has funny things

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,920
happen once you get over a certain size

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:04,970
they say offend Amazon s3 that most

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:07,580
reliable right no security now I know

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,230
people who start out think why would

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,390
anyone care about more we saw it's just

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,520
starting up it's

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,520
it's nothing it's well there's no reason

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,600
to come and hack my site but I've had

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,250
sites that were quite new and they were

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,310
hacked and they were a South African

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,640
bank was set up in place of them because

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:32,740
a soft side is easier to use but by

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,810
hackers to use other things fishing and

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,630
things like that so if you make your

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,730
site slightly harder to access then the

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,040
next WordPress site then I'll just move

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,070
on to the softer targets and you'll

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,250
avoid the trouble so wordfence is a

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,970
popular plug-in for that I really like

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,460
WP all-in-one security I think it's

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,710
called it's kind of like that a bit

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,710
lighter but it's all quite effective

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:09,850
right so caching if you've if you're a

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,100
programmer and you can custom make all

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,380
the code for your theme from the ground

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,700
up you probably have a very slick fast

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,370
site you probably don't even think about

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,590
caching but these days we're using lots

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,810
of tools themes with visual editors and

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:30,310
lots these 50 plugins location can save

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:32,770
you a lot of grief and there's plenty of

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,470
options around there's pay there's free

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,060
options there's paid options you just

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,070
search for WordPress keishon that your

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,540
file is there's a number about there but

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,770
it's worth it's it's one of the

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:48,370
foundation things you should consider

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:50,760
having an every site contact forms I'm

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,440
sure everyone here's a contact form

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,850
how many people have contact forms how

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,330
many people don't have contact forms

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:01,990
that do not save entries

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:06,010
no one's gonna put the hand up oh the

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:09,010
issue is you've created a website you've

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,240
done marketing people come to found you

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,240
they've come to your website they've

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,990
looked at your site they said yes I

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,160
think I do want to work with this person

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,080
they go to your contact form they've

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,620
okay go to the trouble of filling in the

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,779
hit send and then after that point

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,410
things

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:29,990
happen websites often lose a weapon

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,029
email on the way out there can be an

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,199
issue with a mail exchanger of the

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:38,230
hosting or a setting that doesn't work

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,639
your email account might have a problem

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,279
there's so many factors that can lose

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,689
that email between the send and your

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:51,379
inbox and you just lost this critical

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:54,230
leave when if you if you allow your

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,490
website to save copies of the forms at

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,959
least you've got a fallback you can go

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,389
back on a regular basis and go oh

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,129
they're forum and I've seen I've seen it

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,930
happen that's happening when a

00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,499
percentage of emails have just not made

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,519
it out

00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:09,319
so obviously gravity forms is a plug-in

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,379
that everyone's heard of it's a paid

00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,779
option but you can find some of the free

00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:17,749
plug-ins out there that have add-ons

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:21,050
that will make them save copies in the

00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:22,730
database so do some research and have a

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,670
look for those if you're not up for

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,220
paying for a paid tool I think you can

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,189
leverage free tools if you right combine

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,839
a standard contact plug-in with a an

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:40,129
add-on that creates database entries

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,290
okay on your form you need to also think

00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:46,610
about how many fields you're making the

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,800
person fill in too many fields as it

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,959
says there reduces the pollution rate by

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,720
50% every field you add you want to ask

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:58,160
them I don't know how they found you is

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,149
probably an import one to have but

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,329
there's other questions that you may

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,089
want to avoid I have a short contact

00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,559
form for the initial contact and then

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,409
I've got longer forms for different

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,789
tasks so someone wants a website built

00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,679
I'll send them a different to a

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,000
different form that has much more detail

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,250
because it we've already started the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,049
conversation and they're prepared for it

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,549
they're prepared to take some more time

00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:23,299
but the initial contact we're trying to

00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:28,039
get that initial spark keep it keep it

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:30,770
as easy as possible for them slow sites

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,970
now I can remember being and being in

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,270
the talker and I think it was seven

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,200
seconds three seconds is the new seven

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,659
seconds

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,880
so if you want to talk about how fast

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:44,720
your site is you're aiming for three

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,960
seconds now I would literally watched my

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,120
site go from six seconds to three

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,510
seconds just by changing hosting they'll

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,639
both host it in Australia but the new

00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:04,389
option was just the Rolls Royce of

00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:07,549
hosting which are outside today okay

00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:11,090
images now this is again talking about

00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:12,590
the speed situation it was very common

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,389
when I was looking at these sites to

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:20,230
find thousand pixel images sitting in

00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:23,899
250 pixel boxes are around the page

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,610
right so think about that think of try

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:30,490
and work out with Google Chrome you can

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:33,980
right click and get image sizes off the

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,539
off the page and just see what size the

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,639
pay of the images are being rendered and

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,519
then create an image that size and

00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:42,740
that's step one then the file size of

00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,149
those images still normally bigger than

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,519
it should be

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:51,260
I'll by the way the three-second rule on

00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:53,120
the previous slide tiny kingdom comm is

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,380
where you can benchmark how fast your

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,080
website is that's a good place to do

00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:02,929
speed checks so back to the images so

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,570
what tiny PNG calm is a great service is

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:08,389
free you can click and drag 10 or 20

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,010
images up to there at once and it will

00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:12,220
reduce them down to the minimum file

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,880
size whether they're PNG is or JPEGs

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:19,570
without losing any quality so it'll give

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,830
you the most efficient image you can get

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,110
and that will help your page load speed

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:29,690
so aim to get this 3 seconds kind of

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:33,889
going how many people here use Yoast for

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:36,309
SEO as an SEO tool how many people here

00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:39,500
use something else

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,750
ok so there's a percentage and I respect

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,260
that I used to use other SEO plugins too

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,539
but it's it's kind of the common SEO -

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,210
all these days

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,950
if you haven't got one I'd seriously

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,960
recommend having a look at it it's free

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,000
it's well supported there's lots of

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,210
people that know about how to use it but

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,360
the next step is don't leave it then in

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,710
the default setup because it generates

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,019
sitemaps for things that you don't

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,019
necessarily need like not every website

00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:12,200
wants authors to be in a site a group of

00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:16,940
that's indexed by Google or sometimes

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:20,809
images projects is a very common tool

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,570
that is part of a lot of themes these

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,130
days and people aren't using them anyway

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,779
so there's no point creating a sitemap

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,130
or letting Google try and index

00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:30,860
something called projects when it's not

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,289
there so and also your social media

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,029
accounts I've found a lot of sites that

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,679
had Yoast installed hadn't put their

00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,200
social media accounts into the setting

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:47,330
for social in the yo settings so that's

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:49,039
worth considering to analytics it's a

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,289
really important thing to do and you

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,059
might think oh I'll get the website

00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:54,769
build and then I'll get to the analytics

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,299
and I've actually had quite a few people

00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:58,279
he didn't have analytics set up because

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,769
I thought they were still in an early

00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,230
stage but really you want your data from

00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,029
day one if you can to show the growth

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,529
and to see who came to your website in

00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:08,450
the beginning and then how it's evolved

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,769
and you need to know if you don't know

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,710
what traffic's come to your site what

00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,029
are you know they're gonna you know grow

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,139
your business you need to know these

00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:24,110
things so get Google Analytics set up

00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:26,480
and then I'd say about 90% of the sites

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,720
that I looked at their Google Analytics

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,309
account even though they moved to HTTPS

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,539
they had not changed their Google

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:38,419
Analytics property settings to HTTPS so

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,340
I bet you there's at least more than 50%

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:47,120
of people here within that scenario

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:50,240
it's so common SSL Certificates I'm

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,300
trying to think of when how many years

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,850
ago that we

00:21:52,300 --> 00:22:00,100
the pendulum really swung towards HTTP I

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,380
think it's it's just so the norm now and

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,930
you'll find if you if you are still

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,980
running on HTTP that your web hosting is

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,480
probably providing you with a free SSL

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,210
certificate through let's encrypt or

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,530
somewhere like that and it could even in

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,540
a lot of cases when I looked at the web

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,790
sites it was already active and they

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,920
just needed to then change these

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,360
settings to HTTPS and there's some other

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,680
steps you need to do to go and find

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,630
references to HTTP but it's not

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,450
impossible to do it's worth it's worth

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,120
doing because you'll get left behind

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:40,720
that ninety-five percent of the web

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,760
sites had HTTPS okay Google search

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,290
console was often missed often people

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,370
were happy to have Google Analytics set

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,960
up they had their WordPress logins but

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,480
they didn't have a girls have Google

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,390
search console set up if you can take

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,610
the time to do it with using DNS

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,100
settings because Google's so Google is

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,020
allowed you to do this now it captures

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,110
all the variations through your website

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,540
whether there's WW and HTTPS and what

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:13,090
sort of stuff the domain level is the

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:15,310
best way to do it and then once you've

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,780
got it set up I found a lot of the sites

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,070
had installed Yoast

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,980
and they hadn't submitted the Yoast

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:27,960
sitemap to the Google search console so

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,090
remember to do that too

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,940
in the in the Yoast settings there is an

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:36,040
area I think it it'sit'sit's won't list

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,140
all the features that you've got in

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,960
Yoast there's a section that says

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,610
sitemap XML and there's you you

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,860
literally can click on a link which will

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,530
show you the sitemap reference and then

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:52,810
get that and put that into your Google

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:55,600
search console make sure the admin email

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:58,000
address is the one that you want to get

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,550
regular updates from Google search

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,520
console I think usually it's turned on

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:05,030
to send you updates but check that it is

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,710
turned on and check the

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,720
you've got the right email address

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,850
connected because a lot of you will use

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,910
a gmail address to set up Google search

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,410
console because it's quick and easy but

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,530
now you can connect your regular

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,570
business email address to Google and

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,840
then add that as an email account as

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,610
well so that it's in your main inbox so

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,380
you don't miss it because you don't

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,280
always check your Gmail as much as your

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:35,120
your commercial your business email

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:39,200
right H once we're getting on to the

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:44,570
content area now h1 is commonly we use

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,060
to make statements down the page because

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,940
they like the fact that the H pumps were

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,470
nice and big and bold but from a Content

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,290
perspective it's kind of confusing you

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:58,010
know you know write an essay and say my

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,540
says about this and then halfway down

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,060
you put another heading of the same

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,160
magnitude as the first one about really

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,110
a subheading so think about that peril

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,180
it's not as John Wheeler says that it's

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,100
not as important to you Google juice as

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,580
it used to be but it's still good

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:17,360
practice you CSS to adjust your h2

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:21,410
settings to be larger if you want to use

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,170
prominent headings and if I found that

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,270
commonly and some things actually for

00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,520
some bizarre reason their comment

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,950
heading was h1 by default so you've got

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,840
to look at your theme and sometimes is

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,340
it issues with that which you would then

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,760
use a child thing that I mentioned to

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,690
fix you can you can sort out issues like

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,040
that with your child theme how many

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,780
people's phone numbers are click-to-call

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,070
how many people's find with a not click

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,860
to call on their website right so we've

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:56,210
entered the mobile first era it's it's

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:59,570
so common now it's painful to try and

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,430
click on that number select the exact

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,770
amount of text go into your phone up and

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,810
paste it in and you know when you really

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,930
just want to push that number and go to

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:11,570
your phone calling section and all you

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:16,270
have to do is put te l colon and then

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:18,240
the number just like you do with an IH a

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,030
normal link acceptance

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,370
HTTP you put te o if you wanna have

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,800
spaces in the way that the numbers

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,990
displayed on the phone put dashes in

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,309
between if you put an actual space in

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,040
those numbers I think he'll have an

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:34,830
issue or put the whole number in his one

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,080
continuous number to rip it was so

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,800
common like so common on the websites

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,660
that I looked at and you know it's

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:47,480
slowing people down it's it's not making

00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:51,860
it as easy to get hold of you okay so

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:56,280
how many people have got ecommerce sites

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:59,670
yeah think about whether you've got

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,960
terms and conditions in terms of service

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,230
on your website because I think it's

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,350
Australian law that you meant to take so

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,390
and a lot of clients that I looked at

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,590
didn't have that so you're kind of

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,020
flying blind you kind of break through

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,250
some rules there's there's plenty of

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,950
services out there to help you do that

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,160
WordPress has got some templates to help

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:23,840
you do your privacy settings so think

00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,840
about that from a commercial perspective

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,210
basic architecture now I guess it's it's

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,179
kind of everyone's got an opinion about

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,340
this but don't don't get creative with

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,080
him with your navigation it's meant to

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,300
be boring it's meant to be easy to get

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,960
to it's meant to get get people to where

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,220
they need to go

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,740
don't say ask us ask us about or

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,260
something instead of contact you know

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,120
just get to it cart

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,559
what's wrong with card what what are we

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,210
need bag now like I think it's out to

00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,440
other software's probably using we're

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:05,400
trying to copy them let's stick to our

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:08,240
guns we started with car 10-second rule

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,830
in ten seconds

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,470
follow up to any of your websites what I

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,179
know who you were what you do who you do

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,370
it for and why you're better than anyone

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,929
else at it tense do you think you could

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,150
communicate that in ten seconds or would

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:24,179
you have to read for three minutes to

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:29,070
find out that you I don't know a great

you to come down to the mic

00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:46,749

that'll fix stuff up the livestream

00:30:53,659 --> 00:31:03,379
sorry you recommend updraftplus for our

00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:05,829
backups yeah I use up drachmas and I'll

00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:09,019
back up on a weekly basis to Amazon s3

00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:10,999
yeah yeah problem I have with it it also

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:14,899
stores the backup on the website itself

00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:16,309
how can i but we're dead it says it

00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:20,239
doesn't have that setting does it to

00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:26,359
delete after after sending now you're

00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:27,919
just gonna do housekeeping I know you

00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:31,190
can tell how many backups to keep on you

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,429
on you in general in the on the settings

00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,489
page

00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:38,839
I usually do it about 10 just in case

00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:42,019
yeah and but then again it I've had 400

00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,489
backups stored there are times I think

00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,339
there's a setting that you can set how

00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:47,509
many copies of keeps in general yeah I

00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:49,279
can't work out where to put it

00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,659
Peter said it it said that it's at the

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,059
very top when you go to settings that

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:55,039
says do weekly monthly daily whatever

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:58,129
yeah and right next to that it says how

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,789
many yeah and I said that but it's

00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,489
awesome

00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:03,229
still stores it and then when I delete

00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:05,059
it from the website it also deletes it

00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:10,940
from history yeah I don't I don't know

00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:15,199
the answer to that okay do you know

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:18,079
something about that cron job if you if

00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:20,599
you can do cron jobs I can advise you on

00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,459
cron jobs the updraftplus people are

00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,259
also really handy so if you log a help

00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,879
ticket they do usually respond they

00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,409
usually about 48 hours but they usually

00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:29,179
quite good and I'll get back to you to

00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:34,309
help and I've backed up sites that were

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:36,160
unbearable on paid backup software with

00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:39,250
WP updraft plus it's

00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:43,930
so got it backing up hard sites and big

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:45,490
sites particularly for a remote storage

00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:48,130
I've had issue forget sending remote

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:52,330
copies up to our plasma bachelors it

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:54,910
really well yeah Tony um yes so your run

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,810
you sort of seem like a pretty good on

00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,020
Yoast SEO

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:02,080
have you tried all-in-one SEO and do you

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:04,600
that's the what that's that's historical

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,180
that's an historical SEO tool that's

00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:13,120
like one of the first ones that are used

00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:14,680
yeah I use both and not find HS sort of

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,150
they have their own quirks Eames it's

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,100
the thing that is it interests me though

00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:21,160
that as Yoast is working with Google on

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,600
a regular basis so they're a bit a bit

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,540
more cutting-edge and yes sometimes I do

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,700
things that break almost break the yo

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,810
setting the SEO settings but they fix it

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,270
pretty quickly with the automatic

00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:36,520
updates so it's real it's like it's

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,190
almost like Betamax and VHS like it's to

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,570
me it's like yeah Yoast is kind of the

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:51,340
primary these days for me there's some

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:53,640
other ones I use as well but yo is there

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,780
one website that comes to your mind

00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,360
regardless of deem this tree or whatever

00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,860
but something one or two websites that

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,330
come to your mind right now that you can

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,780
say people this is what a website should

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,780
be like

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:20,190
besides yours Tiny's got a good website

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,220
if you haven't found it yet all the one

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:26,069
recipe says only one SEO recipe for

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:31,770
success is one elegant themes is the

00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:33,780
other elegant themes calm hello I'm

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,450
wondering like is there any optimal

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,020
number of plugins that you would like to

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:42,359
limit yourself in terms of installation

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:45,000
no because they're all different some of

00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:46,679
bulky and use a lot of resources and

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,030
some of lean and don't it doesn't matter

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,440
you could have you could have 50 lean

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,720
plugins that have really well coded

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,869
wouldn't matter but you could have 5

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,270
heavy sluggish plugins that create

00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,530
problems no it's just comes down to how

00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,299
good the plug-in is look at how many

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,839
downloads are oh look at how regulates

00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:06,299
updated look at who's supporting that

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,859
plug-in whether it's a lone developer

00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:09,660
who's at uni looks gonna get bored in a

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:11,010
couple of years or whether it's a it's

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,530
got a company behind it that are going

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,480
to fund regular updates that are

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,970
prepared to kind of keep community check

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,290
on the latest versions of WordPress to

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,599
keep it current

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,299
so it's really bit the pedigree that

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,569
plug-in not the quantity yeah and

00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:29,730
definitely not a hundred I'm conscious

00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:31,650
of the time so I know that Tony's going

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,700
to be around in the the tea breaks and

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,960
the lunches and things so he's

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,559
definitely somebody that you can have a

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,839
yawn to ask questions of get on to his

00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,790
website in his insta and chase him down

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,700
and ask questions and I still do those

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,490
health checks for not only clients but

00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,770
for developers so if you want a sanity

00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,319
check of what you've done before you

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,299
sort of send it on your way I don't do

00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,680
that service for developers - yeah and

00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:57,210
I've noticed that there is that G can

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,770
she buy one of his health checks from

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,599
his actual website you can click and

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,609
purchase so that's it's very handy to

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,380
have a second set of eyes so I'd like

00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:07,200
you to join me in thanking Tony for

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,530
sharing a whole lot of the wisdom

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,530
