Title: Mel Telecican: How Elementor Changed my Life (for the better!)
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	Before Elementor was installed on my sites I was wary of doing very much in the backend of my website. As someone who loves to action things quickly (think MVP), not being able to iterate without handing it over to my web guy was super frustrating. When Elementor entered my life I felt significantly more confident to develop new pages, update content and get creative.

first up can I say thank you for being

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,320
here after a massive weekend of learning

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,580
and meeting lots of people thanks for

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,019
hanging around it's always nice to know

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,250
that there's more than a handful of

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,400
people here so thank you yeah Elementor

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,470
has absolutely changed my life and and

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,289
as was said I'm the marketing and sales

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,789
automation specialist it's where I get

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,619
very excited working with people and of

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,390
course strategy is a big part of all of

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,670
that as well so I run two businesses one

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,320
of them is does custom work and the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,140
other is like a training business for

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,690
people who like to DIY so it's about

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,550
helping people understand all of the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,149
elements of something and be taught

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,510
using non-technical terms so Who am I

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:55,020
not I'm not a web developer I'm not a

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,149
web designer I'm also not an elemental

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,600
expert which is important for you to

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:04,140
know but rather I'm a very enthusiastic

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,909
user so in fact I was after school one

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,270
day with my son I was at the park

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,890
there's another family's there and I was

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,680
talking to one of the mums and she said

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,630
to me Mel I'm having some issues I need

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,030
some content change to my website I'm

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,200
finding it really difficult and it's not

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,390
going to be done in time for this event

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,640
that I've got coming up and so I'm

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,650
thinking about changing to Wix or

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,320
Squarespace to which I said no no I know

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,060
I've had some idea about her big picture

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,860
dreams and what she was hoping for for

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,350
her business I said look you're gonna

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,049
have some real limitations it's going to

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,790
hold you back later so do me a favor go

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,430
and try this this product that I've been

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,420
using it's called Elementor have a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,670
little look around there's lots of

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,880
videos and content online and see what

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,880
you think and 48 hours later she text me

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,759
and said amazing fantastic

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,619
this is game-changing for me and so

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,079
while we're not about replacing web

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,909
developers or web designers it's about

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,659
having that functionality and being able

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,489
to change small things on as we need to

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,009
right sort of Minimum Viable Product if

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,569
we need to put a new image in or we need

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,130
to put a new block of text or we want to

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,600
put a price

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,790
table in that we can do that without

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,460
breaking everything and of course

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,650
backups are really important still so

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,480
what is Elementor for those of you who

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,440
aren't aware I'm sure most of you are

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,920
but I'll run through it anyway

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,260
is that it's a drug drag and drop page

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,720
builder plugin for WordPress so if any

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,250
of you have used if you're a DIY you

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,320
might have come across something like

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:41,230
canva which is very user friendly and

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,790
it's one of these graphic design

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,650
solutions where you can it makes it

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,850
easier I guess is lots of drag-and-drop

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,740
functionality so I see Elemental like

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,930
that in lots of ways it's much more

00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,080
complex but it's incredibly

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,000
user-friendly for the non coders amongst

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,950
us hands up with a non coders are just

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,180
out of interest yep so I'm not alone

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,700
that's always good to know when you're

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,760
talking if you had something like this

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:13,610
so for me life is now somewhat broken

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:17,540
into two parts the year 2018 B II before

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:21,440
Elementor and the year 2019 after

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,710
elemental and so in 2019 I would go to

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,350
my web designer and say could you just

00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,340
do this and for the worked as hunters in

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,680
the room you're rolling your eyes

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,360
already groaning I can hear can you just

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,210
copy and paste that and move this from

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,700
there and do all that and of course I

00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,090
would get yes sure Mel yes okay but it's

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,230
going to take us a few days and so

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,170
naturally even though I did have an

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,840
understanding of the need to do things

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,980
properly it was still problematic for me

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,350
so when when my designer said here Mel

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,180
I'm putting Elementor on your site go

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,100
nuts and we're you know we back it up

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,310
regularly and things like that it really

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,440
was a game changer so I'm really happy

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,520
and my web designer is equally as happy

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,960
so what I've done is I've done some

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,810
short videos because I didn't trust

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,360
myself to do anything alive and I'll

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,250
just show you really quickly the couple

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,710
of sites that I have designed using

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,500
elemental so this is the first business

00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,699
loyalist and as you can see there it's

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,610
got what's call

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,710
and now it's escaped me it is an

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,229
animated headline so as you scroll down

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,229
below the fold you can see that we've

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:40,590
added in some nice features there

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,539
scrolling features or motion effects as

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,400
well and then there's the second website

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:49,259
that I've done and while these are not

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,330
well these are not the world's most

00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,639
beautiful well-designed sites they're

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,890
still highly professional everything has

00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,029
been built using the element or elements

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,029
[Music]

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,389
so for those of you who are wanting to

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,169
know what is involved in free elemental

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,669
free and pro I'll start with free and so

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,110
you can see here these are some of the

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,680
elements so this is what you will drag

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,210
and drop across into into the display

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,400
which you'll see in a little bit as well

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,440
things like images and buttons all the

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,729
obvious things that are there spaces

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,740
google maps in addition to that or all

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:35,250
of these features all of these graphic

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,580
web design elements rather so menu

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,250
anchors progress bars formats for

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,419
testimonials so you don't have to do you

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,169
know design them up it's already

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,460
pre-templated you can still adjust it

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,889
really really lovely and of course you

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,570
can drag and drop at HTML block as well

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:55,080
so if you're looking to integrate

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,870
something like your I kept ointment

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,940
calendar booking tool you can literally

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:06,810
pull that block in copy and paste the

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:09,539
embed code and away you go and so a

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,699
little bit of a demonstration of the

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,430
drag-and-drop functionality for you so

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:20,150
that's one of my websites here's the

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,150
back end clicking on edit with Elementor

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,889
and as you can see all the elements

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,449
appear left of screen so this is in

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,430
desktop version you can see what the

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,889
desktop appears like you can see here

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,349
I'm duplicating a section and so I'm

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,060
just showing you how easy it is to once

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,650
you've setup one section I'm probably

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,439
not using the correct terminology but

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,569
one section and one you know sets out

00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,289
sets of columns you're able to then

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,300
duplicate and edit and go from there so

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,310
it's really easy it's you can see there

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,330
that you can change the words you can

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,490
change the colors you can add columns

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,409
and then you can get tricky and start

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:03,449
creating other features as well such as

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:06,349
scrolling effects or motion effects so

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:09,180
who hasn't who hasn't used Elementor yet

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:12,090
how are you feeling about this is it

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,250
feeling achievable yeah is it feeling

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,229
like you're still getting a high quality

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:22,770
outcome as a result of dragging and

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:24,539
dropping yeah so good stuff here I'm

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,099
just playing around as you can see it's

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,689
really a case of getting in and having a

00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,759
bit of a play around of course and so

00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,259
here I'm just playing around with one of

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
the motion effects the scrolling effect

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,500
can increase and decrease the speed and

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,229
then of course the viewport which is

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,659
about how much I guess something can

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:44,789
drop in or come from the side those

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,580
sorts of things so clearly this goes on

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:52,110
a little bit too long so I clearly enjoy

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,990
playing around there and so what you can

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:59,129
do also beyond that I'll just wait you

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,419
can see there let's see the hover over

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,960
here on the far left you can see what

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,909
says desktop tablet and mobile and so

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,469
you can actually elect to just click on

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,029
that get rid of mobile I'll get rid of

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,039
tablet and just say look bad sections

00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,649
just for desktop or that section is for

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,569
desktop and tablet and you can literally

00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:20,039
pick it from there very straightforward

00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:22,319
you can go to style change your colors

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,939
really easily in the hallway track we

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,610
were talking about once it's set up it's

00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,979
a case of then if you set it up properly

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,840
it's a case of all your brand's style

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,000
guide colors being there

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,610
your fonts and the sizes default sizes

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,620
are all there so really really friendly

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,910
and then there's something called shape

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,500
dividers which are a bit of fun

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:44,240
especially if you've got you know maybe

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,350
a creative or artistic style business

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,750
you can do them for the top and the

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,460
bottom of each section play around with

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,380
those as a whole range and you can just

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,870
see this this is not an edited video

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,970
it's that quick you click on it drop

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,150
down choose it play around and see what

00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,150
works

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:12,780
still playing clearly still enjoying

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,700
that and then in just a minute you can

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,650
see down the bottom in that gray section

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,210
on the left there you'll be able to see

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,610
shortly I'll click on the monitor and

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:25,800
that's where you can have a look and you

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,410
can start editing for mobile or for

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,450
tablet and adjusting so once you've done

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,520
say your desktop design to start with if

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,460
that's what you choose to do then you

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,010
can what am I doing here adding columns

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,480
there we go I'm replicating above so you

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,120
can see the lovely design of the above

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,290
it's literally a case of pulling in a

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,420
text block adding an extra column

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,930
dragging in an image uploading from the

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,930
media file

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:13,870
drag and drop a textblock very easy nice

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:18,220
to use so how does this compare to your

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,650
page builder who's liking this one

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,090
better than what they've got currently

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,800
just one yeah yeah so it's worth having

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:34,540
a look at I'm playing with that's for

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:38,980
sure all right skip ahead skip ahead

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:42,780
shortly here we go still enjoying the

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,780
colors there we go lots of lovely colors

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,260
here we go responsive mode so we can

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,270
pull it into tablet make sure that we're

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,540
happy with the layout readjust for

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,010
tablet or readjust for mobile which I'll

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:02,260
show you a little bit more about later

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:04,450
as well all right and so then requests

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:12,940
access well that's problematic isn't

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:14,740
that okay so really what this is because

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,960
it's not appearing that's okay I will

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,970
pull this up really quickly and pause

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,130
this because it was working this morning

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,100
so I'm not sure why it wouldn't be

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:27,790
working right now bear with me one

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,770
second so if you can see that the idea

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,420
here is that at the top on the left hand

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,940
side you can see that it breaks down

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,140
into three key sections and actually

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,920
it's showing way out there because

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:43,840
that's actually a design but let me move

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:48,040
along a little even more please that I

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,840
didn't do this live now it's still

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,940
showing layout okay

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,310
unfortunate so but on those top three

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,610
sections are the top three sections is

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,680
basically content then style and then

00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,630
advanced and so I guess you enter your

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,310
content in it's very straightforward I

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,960
don't know why this is not working all

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,280
of a sudden style that's where you

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,040
change your fonts and your colors and

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,810
everything like that

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,180
and then advanced is where you can start

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,920
doing things like bringing in you know

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,250
scrolling effects motion effects and

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,399
then you change from mobile or tablet

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,339
and so the pro elements for the paid

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,380
element or plugin includes all of these

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:29,389
elements or these design design parts so

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,810
very cool things like portfolios slides

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,279
and media carousels log in which a lot

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,920
of people are looking for but can't do

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,319
animated headlines as you saw before a

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,889
pricing table navigation menu

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:44,120
call-to-action boxes a countdown timer

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,329
which I'm going to show you really

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,480
shortly reviews share buttons Facebook

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,649
embed codes and even forms we all know

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
that they're one of the hardest things

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,860
to do and so this makes it very very

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,860
easy as well

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:25,050
well that's not good let's see No all

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,749
right so who knows what a countdown

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,600
timer is you know if you have campaigns

00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:33,149
where you're looking to open and close

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,980
an intake they're great and often people

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,629
need to buy another or you know get

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,339
another plugin and add it to the stack

00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,199
and so as Tony was talking about

00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,029
yesterday the less plugins the better

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,740
really unfortunate that that's not

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,509
working because it actually shows you

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,790
how easy that is it's another drag and

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,649
drop countdown timer you can adjust

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,389
everything change the background change

00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,610
the color of the letters and then of

00:13:51,389 --> 00:14:02,069
course go in and readjust for mobile and

00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:05,129
for tablet as well this one is working

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:06,990
and so then of course there's the motion

00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,209
effects which is a feature of pro as

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,249
well so similarly at the top here you

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,740
can see there's the animated headline

00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:15,899
and then here we've used the scrolling

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,610
the scrolling effect the motion effect

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,759
and you can set that up on the far

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,209
left-hand side to whatever speed you

00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,000
want and again it's a case of figuring

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,309
out how much of how subtle or how

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,860
significant you want that atom that

00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,689
motion to be and so you can just play

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,750
around in there choose vertical or

00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:38,910
horizontal scroll adjust that speed and

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,120
then there's the viewport there at the

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,410
bottom that tells you just how much it's

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,209
going to speed in whether it's going to

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:53,370
fly in from the side or if it's going to

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:54,839
be quite small very unfortunate that

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,089
last video didn't work because it has a

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,779
pricing table as well so if you saw the

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:03,809
pricing table on my site preview for

00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:06,720
it's very very smart well it's it's just

00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:12,720
a very smart setup this is another

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,220
example of the the motion effects but

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,500
the pricing table is great because it's

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,689
literally a case of bring it in choosing

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,610
the color changing all the features or

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,880
the benefits changing the amount it's

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,470
all fields on the left-hand side and and

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,450
then you can just adjust it and then

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,750
duplicate if you've got for example a

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,579
three tiered pricing structure and it's

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,860
really smart it's unfortunate that that

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,690
is not deciding to work after working

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,060
all the other times that it worked so

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,430
those are the two sites and if you want

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,459
to have a look at the motion effects

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,560
that that Elementor can do I strongly

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:49,260
recommend you go and check out just

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,079
search for element or motion effects and

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,720
there is a brilliant space scenario has

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,120
anyone seen it and as you go down the

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,339
page it's it's an outerspace scene and

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,950
the motion everything's moving and it's

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:07,440
just very elegant and beautiful and very

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:11,760
I would say the the capabilities of the

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,040
of the of these of these elements is

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,140
actually very high level so when you

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,940
look at a very high level site who had

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,399
that has all of these animations in play

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,839
this is giving you that capability in

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:28,560
pro so make sure you have a look at that

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:32,279
so I regularly talk about great ways to

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,709
do things so in non techie terminology

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,850
so if you'd like to connect those are my

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:41,720
connections on Instagram and LinkedIn

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,720
thank you and questions

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,430
I'd love to just flip back and just see

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:55,110
if that one's gonna work why would you

00:16:50,430 --> 00:17:00,450
request access not gonna happen

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:04,680
hi mail yep I got one I'm here right

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:07,439
Ronny so it seems like you really

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,470
enjoyed playing around and exploring

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,910
this yes so I'm just wondering whether

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,579
that was ever a problem with you need to

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,020
keep this in this box like did you end

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,790
up doing this on your Friday nights you

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,760
Saturday nights as well and was that a

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,829
problem at all yeah you know what it is

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,540
is that I love my work but I don't get

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,610
to do I do creative things but I don't

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,370
get to do visually creative things right

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:32,100
as much and so yeah it might have become

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,630
a bit of an issue but I guess it's like

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,430
anything the more you play around with

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,510
it and get comfortable with it the more

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,130
it makes sense and then you start seeing

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,200
other things out in the world and going

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,510
on oh okay I can see how I could apply

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,590
that and especially the the motion

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,929
effects but it's okay it's not habit I'm

00:17:46,590 --> 00:18:01,440
gonna be alright but really enjoyable

00:17:48,929 --> 00:18:04,920
cool thanks well reviews now does that

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,240
boolean reviews from Google actually

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:15,620
Michael that might be a question for you

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:15,620
know our face book reviews yeah yeah

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,400
yeah and there is a Google review one

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,400
there's a free one and a paid one

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,679
[Music]

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,370
you'd talk to us about that countdown

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,340
timer do you know whether or not

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,380
Elementor can automatically change the

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,360
content so I have something the counter

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,150
there until this date and then are

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,809
different yes/no so you set the date and

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,280
you can choose whether you've got days

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,990
you know the four the four things days

00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,790
minutes hours seconds or whatever the

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,950
options are that's not right but you

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,870
know what I'm talking about yes and then

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,640
so once it's down that it's out so then

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,650
you can reset it you can also hide it of

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:16,320
course as well Michael is there anything

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:19,049
else that yeah Michael is the community

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,690
the Elementor meetup community leader at

00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:25,280
the Gold Coast so he is definitely the

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,600
man to ask the more technical questions

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,730
yeah but it's great it's a brilliant

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,140
tool and we use it with we've used it

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,510
with our clients who've got Elementor

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,970
and they find it brilliant because they

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,230
want to be able to have control over you

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,360
know opening and closing that and not

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,040
have to you know think too much about it

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,510
when they decide yes we're going to open

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,230
again and they can do that without too

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:51,480
much fuss with several of the functions

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,870
in Elementor duplicating what's already

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,880
in the theme how did you decide on what

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,980
functions you will allow the theme to

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,929
manage such as menus and things of that

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,720
nature as Kesari so that last bit again

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,900
so how did you decide on what functions

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,240
you would allow the theme to manage such

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:14,910
as navigation and what functions you'd

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,740
then set up and elemental so so we so I

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,240
didn't set this up myself so we didn't

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,830
mind the thing is that we haven't

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
actually used a theme so we've just

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,480
brought in blocks and then decided what

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,700
would be in each there are themes that

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,960
can you can follow the format and you

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,559
can do it that way but it asked was

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,370
setup from from scratch so we decided

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,470
what we wanted to be in each part right

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,809
so what theme were you using with your

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,490
elemental so we didn't use it we didn't

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,990
use a theme there are a few things you

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,820
were talking about earlier today there's

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:52,799
a straw what are the other couple of pop

00:20:44,820 --> 00:21:02,220

00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:05,100
