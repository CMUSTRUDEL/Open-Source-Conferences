Title: Georgia Mountford: Building a Hybrid JavaScript app for WordPress: Georgia Mountford: Building a ...
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	At the end of 2018, we launched a custom eLearning platform that is built on the WordPress backend and experienced through our ReactJS frontend. In this talk, I would like to discuss why we chose the hybrid approach and how itâ€™s a viable option for designers/developers looking to modernise their WordPress sites incrementally. I will share the technical challenges we faced throughout the project, including how we overcame them, and what we intend to do next with our web app.

[Applause]

00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:06,839
thank you all right I might need to move

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,389
this up a bit can you hear me okay yep

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,340
great all right I know you've done this

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,750
a lot of times today but I also want to

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,730
know who's in the room and who I'm

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,090
speaking to so can I get a show of hands

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,680
for designers and developers business

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,810
owners like DIY WordPress is any agency

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,109
owners or people who run a team of devs

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,269
okay cool I hope you all get something

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,669
out of this talk I know the title does

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,590
make it sound like it's very techy but I

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,940
do think that the overall message that I

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,250
want to share today is something that

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,960
everybody can get something from and at

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,120
the end I will share exactly what I

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,620
think each group can learn from my

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,210
experience on this project so basically

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,449
what I want to talk to you today about

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,420
is this JavaScript app that we built and

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,030
embedded in WordPress so the how and why

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,800
of that I'll go over technical

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,350
challenges and how we solved them and

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,329
why I think this hybrid approach is

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,140
something that might be useful for you

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,420
if you don't know what I mean by hybrid

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,060
basically we went halfway to headless if

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,920
I can call it that there's been other

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,570
talks this weekend about the whole

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,060
headless thing and the Gatsby thing so I

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,070
won't go into all of that our project

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,250
though basically were a mix of both

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,310
worlds I did this with my partner Hamish

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,200
he was a lead developer he came to this

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,390
project with a strong background in

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,759
c-sharp programming and in JavaScript

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,470
but no experience from whatsoever with

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,329
WordPress or even PHP and I came taking

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,000
the role of sort of front-end design and

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,590
project leads so I shared with the

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,960
client on the requirements and managed

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,310
the project so why did we do this well

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,439
sometime last year I was approached by a

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,640
client who wanted an e-learning

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,799
membership site or a subscription-based

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,079
tutorial platform to be built for pole

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,790
dance fitness tutorials and it was

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,740
actually because of this niche that we

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,840
came across a lot of custom requirements

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,810
that it actually led to us choosing this

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,630
hybrid approach so what my client really

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,000
wanted were

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,610
a lot of the usual things to manage

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,400
subscriptions restrict content have

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,260
tutorials with quizzes attached and

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,170
obviously be usable on different devices

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,940
be easy for the team to upload tutorials

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,550
and easy for the students to consume

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,920
them what was interesting though was

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,340
they wanted this custom design that

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,770
would support a different kind of

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,900
learning experience so the way that

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,120
pole-dancing is taught basically there's

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,100
not necessarily a linear progression is

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,940
not your academic module one lesson one

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,860
and so forth

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,870
it's a collection of skills that are

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,150
linked together in in different ways and

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,040
we want the students to be able to kind

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,400
of navigate through that with their own

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,990
flexible learning path oops so

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,520
immediately I recognized this meant we

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,990
would need custom post types we've heard

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,230
a lot about custom post types this

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,120
weekend so I'd need custom fields and

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:11,560
I've mean relationships between these

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,930
CPT's we'd also need advanced search and

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,870
filter functionality and also good

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,760
indexing on all of our tutorials and the

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,400
related data so that that search and

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,170
filter happened quickly

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,960
then to support the personalization

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,630
aspect are we needed to be able to save

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,550
data about the members activity so what

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,410
tutorials they watched maybe how many

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,630
times have they done the quiz did they

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,940
pass it and from that we can build

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,750
custom queries to make recommendations

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,240
to what they should watch next and last

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,330
but not least we wanted the UI to be

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,130
smooth and sleek for the user so we want

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,590
an experience where they can navigate

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,900
between these related tutorials really

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:58,510
naturally and also find new tutorials

00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,130
that they're interested in so after

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,750
weighing up all of those things we

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,610
decided we wanted to leverage the

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,680
WordPress back-end because it's a really

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,050
powerful CMS and it's got a lot of great

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,940
plugins that would suit our needs and we

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,010
wanted to build our own front-end so

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,160
that we could have that single page app

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:19,450
that is fast and beautiful and easy to

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,920
use but we we we felt that we didn't

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,380
have the time or the resources to

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,630
do the entire solution that way so we

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,820
decided we would embed a fully

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,280
functional react app in WordPress and

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,680
then try to make the transition as

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,320
seamless as possible for our users so as

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,050
they moved from the regular pages to the

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,400
web app we wanted that to feel seamless

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,340
to them so this hybrid approach really

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,410
suited the blend of our team skills I

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,800
came to the project knowing WordPress

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,510
but have no experience with react and my

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,000
lead developer was the opposite

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,890
we'd also done a similar way smaller

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,170
project before something that was more

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,790
like a proof-of-concept with embedding

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,160
reacts in WordPress so we knew it was

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,670
possible and we were ready to take on

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,800
this more ambitious project it was also

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,080
ideal to do the hybrid approach because

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,150
it meant that we could limit the

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,810
headless Ness if I can call it that

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:21,050
again to just the core functionality so

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,510
our e-learning experience then that

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,150
enabled us to develop things faster to

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,090
do a really good job of that UI and then

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,210
still have room to grow later so that

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,040
flexibility was really important to us

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,420
because we did want to leverage a lot of

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,490
the other WordPress out-of-the-box

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,170
solutions for your things like you know

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,370
membership management payment gateways

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:45,320
contact forms and etc we also were able

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,120
to continue using page builders for the

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,000
other parts of the website that are more

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,590
simple home contact about and my client

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,210
could go straight into the blog section

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,100
and be familiar with the WordPress

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,550
interface and and take care of that

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,910
themselves so now we know why let's talk

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,490
about how we did this this was our tech

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,460
stack the key things really are just

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,160
react j/s that was what we used for our

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,310
UI + WP graph QL

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,870
which was a data access layer we also

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,660
then wrote a couple of custom

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,700
integrations so that WP graph QL could

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,650
talk to the other plugins that we chose

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,050
and

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,260
case this was our CP for the membership

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,470
management facet WP for the search we

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,940
filter an indexing and meta box io which

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:35,530
was our cpt manager of choice I don't

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,360
want to talk too much about why we chose

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,340
react because you could do this in any

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,740
JavaScript framework of your choice or

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,050
vanilla Jas I will say though that we

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,229
founded a pleasure to code in react and

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,830
I kind of fell in love with JSX just

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,050
quietly and we also really loved that we

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,520
could use material UI which is an

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,430
implementation of Google's material

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,500
design that's made for react and that

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,350
meant we could use like really cool

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,270
buttons sliders grids poppers and have

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,419
an attractive UI up and running really

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,060
quickly I do want to spend a bit of time

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,740
on why we chose graph QL because this

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,590
was really the game changer for our

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,110
project for those of you who are not

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,690
familiar with with graph QL it's it's

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,199
essentially a more modern alternative to

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:26,380
rest and it's significantly better from

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,840
a performance aspect it's also really

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,539
simple to write and execute complex

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,160
queries with flexible user inputs and

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:38,500
its supports nested queries and related

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,060
data really nicely and as you may

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,330
remember from the requirements all these

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,280
things were important for us so this was

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,669
made possible by a plug-in called WP

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,370
graph QL and if you are interested in

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,530
the rest versus graph QL discussion I

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,900
would check out Jason Balls Twitter page

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,340
because there's this interesting thread

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,930
there where actually one of our other

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,770
speakers gets a shout out which I

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,490
thought was cool all right so now we

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:09,430
have the plan and we have the pieces the

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:14,050
path was not without obstacles so let's

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,639
talk about those first and foremost we

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,039
found there were limited resources on

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,580
doing what we wanted to do this is mid

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,500
to late 2018 and there's a lot of

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,300
tutorials about going headless but not

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,090
really about this hybrid idea and

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,159
definitely not doing it seamlessly so

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,200
the solution was basically trial and

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,169
error not a problem solving

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,469
in the end our solution was that we made

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,750
templates a single and archive.php with

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,419
empty Dom container that they gets

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,700
loaded into we configured WordPress to

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,399
route to these templates whenever our

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,290
slug matched the certain types of CPT's

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,019
you can see a tutorial for example there

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,930
and we would in queue our scripts on

00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:00,430
that slug and did you any other scripts

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:03,459
that we didn't need we also struggled a

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,779
little bit with the limited dev

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,120
experience that we had in WordPress

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,980
coming into the project because both my

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,649
partner and I are suppose were trying to

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,389
run before we could walk almost so we

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,339
were experienced with programming but we

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:18,850
weren't that familiar with the WordPress

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:21,940
ecosystem and we found a lot of support

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,579
for amateur level wordpress problems and

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,680
in the end what we realized was we

00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,269
weren't asking questions the way that a

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,769
wordpress developer would and that's why

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,660
we were sort of struggling to get

00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,399
through that barrier eventually we found

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,690
a couple of good slack channels where

00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,760
we've got some excellent support from

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,560
the community so thank you to jason bar

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,579
and the WP crafter well team because

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,339
they showed us the light a lot of times

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:47,110
we also sort of struggled a few times

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,870
with other plugins that we wanted to

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,079
interact with because they only had PHP

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,550
or REST API s the solution there was

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,790
that we wrote our own integration

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,339
functions and resolvers so that our we

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,890
could access their functionality from

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,140
inside our JavaScript and the maturity

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,620
of some of our dependencies was an issue

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:13,810
as well because I'm thinking material

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:16,899
and meta box and WPF ul all had features

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,300
that we really needed now about three

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,760
six nine months down there a release

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,430
plan so it was just the timing thing for

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,170
us and what we did there was work with

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,420
those plug-in developers to either

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,800
provide use cases so that they could you

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,690
know build in some of the stuff that we

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,990
needed and understand what we needed it

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:39,579
for or we raised pull requests and and

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,620
sort of closed that gap so at the end of

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,540
the day we did it we embedded a fully

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,560
functional react app in and otherwise

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,970
completely Stan

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,980
WordPress installation it was beautiful

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,779
now we're doing some refactoring so we

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,430
do need to consolidate a data access a

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,290
componentry we've got about three

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,850
different design patterns from trying to

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,120
put this together over such a short

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,490
amount of time we did have a small team

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,199
just us two working after hours we had

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,999
full-time jobs and we had a very very

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:09,819
hard deadline for launch

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,079
so we also need to now upgrade some of

00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,059
those dependencies that have kind of

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:17,170
caught up if you want to call it that to

00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:19,209
sort of our needs and after that we

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,149
would love to translate more of the

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,279
project into the a scope which I think

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,009
will be really exciting now that WP

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,389
graph QL is part of gatsby we're

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,550
interested in looking at how we can use

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,790
that for that other parts of the site

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,439
that aren't elearning component and

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,749
maybe after that we could look at

00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:40,269
translating some of our react there Jas

00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:42,100
to react in native and possibly offer a

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,610
companion phone app or something like

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,319
that we also want to continue our open

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,779
source contributions and we intend to

00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,430
publish a blog or two about how we did

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,439
what we did so if you're interested in

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,180
more detail or code snippets or any of

00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,129
that sort of thing please get in touch

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,480
with me my details will be on the last

00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:03,670
slide so now we know how the why and

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,519
then what's next I just want to finish

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,259
up by sharing what I really loved about

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,170
it and why I think maybe you would like

00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:12,809
to try it too so it was great for us

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,970
because we got the best of both worlds

00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:18,040
we got to design our front-end in the

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,740
MVC design pattern so your Model View

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,759
controller which was discussed yesterday

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,800
and we still got to use page builders

00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,230
for everything else outside of that

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,579
component and even for rapid iteration

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,029
of mock-ups for things that we were

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,470
going to build in our custom UI we found

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,220
front-end development relatively

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,160
hassle-free

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,050
which compared to my previous experience

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,300
developing for WordPress was kind of a

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,399
breath of fresh air I don't know about

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,579
everybody in this room but I generally

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,610
find it's a mix of convoluted PHP

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:54,129
templates CSS overrides that can get

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,480
very messy jQuery version conflicts or

00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,700
all that sort of fun stuff

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,430
it was really nice to be able to develop

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,960
something for WordPress in a clean and

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,730
more modern way I also actually found a

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,530
someone new to react that the react

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,850
learning curve was with shallower than I

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,070
expected

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,020
case in point about six months after

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,180
launch my client presented me with new

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,250
mock-ups so we're gonna get a nice new

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,790
facelift on the site and I managed to

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,680
reskin the whole app in far less time

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,320
than it took me to do the rest of the

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,060
WordPress site and that was a lot to do

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,520
with material and they're excellent

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,810
themed engine but it wasn't just style

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,360
that we were editing there's a lot of

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,360
layout changes too so the modular

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,670
component thing and the convenience of

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,890
JSX all that just made sense to me and

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,610
it made for a faster development time

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,530
and I loved it it also loved WP q fq l

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,990
that was a very very clean and

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,240
user-friendly way to query our data and

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,870
it was especially convenient with this

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,380
graphical IDE which I called grassy QL

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,220
for my entire time up until I realized

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,500
graphical is much much better way to

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,040
pronounce that it makes so much sense

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,600
it's a good graphical version so this is

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,780
this is a really handy little thing you

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,910
can stick in your WP admin and you can

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,680
run your queries see the results like

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,300
this you can actually explore your

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,100
objects so you can go through and see

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,370
the fields and what they're implementing

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,680
and stuff like that which is very handy

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,420
and absolutely we loved it because the

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,820
client loved it they were impressed and

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,030
happy the end result was fast and smooth

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,610
and intuitive and looked great and came

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,880
in on time and on budget so I don't know

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,250
what else you could wonder why you might

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,990
like it I talked about why it fit all of

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,090
our requirements and perhaps that's not

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,180
something that you sort of have the same

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,850
needs for but I still think the hybrid

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,010
approach is worth considering if you're

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,260
a business owner it means that you can

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,240
update your website bring in advanced

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,370
functionality custom designs improve

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,220
performance without doing the whole

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,690
website as an app so if you've been

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,850
interested in this idea of this single

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,010
page app sort of headless WordPress you

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,540
don't have to do it all or nothing you

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,350
can go hybrid and you can do it bit

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,839
simple

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,850
same applies for a designer and a

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,829
developer you can tackle upgrades

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,439
incrementally you can obscure yourself

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,959
progressively take something like the

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:24,170
image gallery or the blog section and

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,009
make your single page app for that load

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,929
UJS on that page and your cooking also

00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,189
if your goal is to go headless I feel

00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,050
like this can be a good stepping stone

00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:35,689
and it can put you on the path to

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,209
perhaps developing software solutions

00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:41,509
that are a wordpress back-end and a

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,160
phone app front-end if you are an agency

00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,600
owner or in a mixed mode team I think

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,459
it's really cool because you can have

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,319
each player working in the ecosystems

00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:51,290
that they are already familiar with and

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:55,459
yet still be solving problems with

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:57,529
modern tools and modern methods and if I

00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,269
can sum it up in a nutshell it's just

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,759
about giving yourself more options

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,920
there's a lot of talk this weekend about

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,420
you know it's a new time for WordPress

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,759
and and all this sort of thing and I

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,350
truly believe that I think that everyone

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,829
can benefit from modernizing their

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,660
WordPress sites without while still

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,819
keeping their existing sites running and

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,370
I think it's great to explore

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:21,379
alternatives to these big overhauls that

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,679
might run over time or over budget or

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,089
just never happen so yeah I think that

00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,709
you should consider a hybrid approach

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,329
for your next project it might be a

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:33,999
quicker or cheaper or more agile

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:33,999
alternative thank you very much

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:59,649
did you have any questions thanks

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:01,930
Georgia that was a great talk I can't

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,329
wait to see what you've built for your

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,360
clients sort of productized and made

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,670
available because it's a sort of thing

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,290
that sort of I think could be really

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,189
successful so good on you

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:18,670
my question was around you sort of

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:22,059
touched on briefly about how you had

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,670
your bit I'm when it came to you know

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,429
you needed features that weren't yet

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,679
available and you touched briefly on

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,720
what you did to go about getting those

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,990
features but I was hoping you could

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,730
expand a little bit more on that from my

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:43,570
perspective is at the other end is as a

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:46,210
plug-in developer trying to meet those

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,059
requirements from the users yeah and I'd

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,360
like to hear what worked well I'll use

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,440
WP graph QL as the example because

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,870
essentially what we found there was

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,370
Jason the plug-in developer was really

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,940
interested in the way that we wanted to

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,360
use the his grotty well they were using

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,610
it for

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
I think news distribution and like

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,809
syndicated blogging and this kind of

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,880
thing so our use case with this whole

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,400
tutorials that are related to each other

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,900
and quizzes and and user data that we're

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,170
saving just wasn't something that was a

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,980
use case that he had built graph QL WP

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,170
graph QL to do so he was I think we were

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,120
just very very lucky he was already

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,910
interested in introducing a lot of these

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,260
things it just was a matter of we did a

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,050
little bit of the grunt work with some

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,780
use cases and and my lead developer did

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,240
do a lot of the coding anyway and raised

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,190
PRS and yeah I think that we were very

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,100
fortunate I do know that in other cases

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,740
a plug-in developer can't cater for all

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,520
these expanding needs that's how we

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,450
handled it

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,500
cool

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,710
I would just then say that echo that is

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,750
is a really good idea even if you don't

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,990
have the technical ability to raise a PR

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,690
that what your tip there on just telling

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:10,810
the developer the use case is super

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:12,760
helpful definitely thank you that you'd

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,050
like to see how its product eyes I did

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,420
regret that I didn't put more

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,910
screenshots in and show some more about

00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,950
what the solution we built and it is

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,220
obviously highly niched for the whole

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,930
fitness thing but I do think it's a

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,180
structure that that can be applied more

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,860
widely so if anybody is interested in

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,970
something similar I would really like to

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,970
talk to you thank you

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,899
