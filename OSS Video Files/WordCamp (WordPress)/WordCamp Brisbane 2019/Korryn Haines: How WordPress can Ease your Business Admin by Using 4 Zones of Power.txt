Title: Korryn Haines: How WordPress can Ease your Business Admin by Using 4 Zones of Power
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brisbane 2019
Description: 
	Most business owners are using WordPress websites but have no idea of its potential power. More than a mere vessel where you display what you do to the online world, a well planned and set out WordPress site can help you put business processes in place that will save you tonnes of wasted time on admin. Iâ€™ve seen it time and time again. As a Virtual Assistant, I constantly refer clients to website developers and become heavily involved in the process, helping them set up back of house systems to make their business life that little bit smoother.

[Applause]

00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,370
[Music]

00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:09,660
[Applause]

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:11,550
hopefully you can hear me okay yes I'm

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,310
usually at home behind a computer so

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:19,710
this is a whole new ballgame for me so

00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:23,430
so as Nick said yes I am a virtual

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:28,130
assistant so I started my business three

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,720
years ago built my own WordPress website

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:35,880
that was a learning curve and a half I

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,360
will say and since then because my

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,460
clients are all either solo micro or

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,670
small businesses they're all using

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,719
WordPress - so a lot of the time I find

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,739
I'm supporting them in using WordPress

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:56,610
in backend of things - so the last year

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,820
was my first year at WordCamp and as

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,090
everyone has mentioned the community is

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,409
amazing and so I thought this year when

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,729
the speaker opportunities came up let's

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:14,430
shake things up a bit and get in front

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:17,040
of the room myself so yeah I'm coming at

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,369
it from the angle of I'm I'm supporting

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,909
people using our using WordPress and

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,780
being in the back in the backend of

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,650
businesses

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,470
I see how WordPress changes how they do

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,110
their day to day and how a website

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,390
change can and all the plugins and all

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:42,750
the extra things can change how you do

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:50,520
your day to day hopefully the clicker

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:53,100
will work I'll go manual so as I

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,290
mentioned I'm a virtual assistant yes I

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,969
am real yes I am a person standing in

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,860
front of you I provide admin support

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,189
remotely I've got clients all around

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,390
Australia and one is based in Hong Kong

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,129
which is rather exciting

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,860
all in varied industries all I've got a

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:18,489
mixture of journalists and engineering

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,500
consultancy so I'm kind of a Jill of all

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:27,390
trades you could say but my my my true

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,549
zone of genius is techie in systems so

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,500
hence why I love WordPress and I also

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:39,849
specialize in G suite so I guess that's

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:49,000
that the the techie brain happening

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:51,150
there so with my work as a Vai I love

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,069
finding efficiencies and how they are

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,360
doing their day to day a lot of my

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,120
clients come to me when they're just

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,430
running and running and running and I

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,459
like to sit down with them and and map

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,440
out okay what are you actually doing and

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,860
how can I help or how can someone else

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,019
help because virtual assistants vary in

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,630
their skill sets like I said I'm a

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,709
techie person but there are other VA s

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:23,200
who do the more the day-to-day checking

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:24,910
emails client liaison from reception

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,639
there is one of my colleagues she's

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:35,139
completely fine reception phone services

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:38,769
so yeah I've been each of the the each

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:41,859
of the things listed above at some point

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:45,160
at some stage in my business so yeah

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:47,769
I've got a varied range of clients so

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:53,290
it's it's challenging and there's a lot

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:56,290
of different hats to wear so today

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,269
here's what I want to run through the

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,889
four the four zones are powering your

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:04,660
business processes and this is where I I

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,419
see it consistently when I start with a

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,190
new client so this is sort of my plan

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,709
attack when I start with a new client

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,530
and I see how that translates into how

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,639
you're using WordPress how to use

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,380
WordPress to strengthen your business

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,670
admin and I'm talking more about the

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,150
strategy be

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,640
because I'm not an expert in WordPress

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,800
and the plugins like the the speaker

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,260
before me I picked up a few plugins

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,370
there where I'm like yes I am I am

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,230
running with that like I got excited

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,260
last month when I figured out how to add

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:42,100
coupons to WooCommerce like it's the

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,290
little things it's the little things how

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,610
to link your systems to processes to

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,360
make your businesses run smoothly

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:53,640
smoothly so I'm very very processing

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,620
systems driven again it's an admin trait

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,750
and the essential WordPress challenges

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,070
clients are outsourcing to a virtual

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,690
assistant

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:08,400
like I said VA is a very varied and I

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:15,640
only do a small part of some WordPress

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:20,080
system so I'll cover that later so the

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:23,110
whole inspiration for my talk today my

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,590
one of my very wonderful clients who I

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,930
love dearly decided to move from another

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:33,580
platform that I won't speak of the name

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,330
here today decided that's it I want to

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,150
go WordPress

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,820
I want to up the ante I want to have

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,820
this this this and this in place so like

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,790
a Hearst a list of developers that I

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,050
have seen the work of or recommend she

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,550
went completely in the opposite

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,380
direction completely fine but and the

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,230
outcome was a fantastic looking website

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,600
but in the back threw up a whole new

00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,230
world of challenges for me as an admin

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,210
person helping them to get around and

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,460
get things flowing smoothly for them

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,300
because up until that point she was a

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,950
one-person show there was no support she

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,320
was doing everything herself a lot of it

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,410
through social media so adding a

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,830
complexity of a new website that does

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:24,910
all these extra things then added to her

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,140
her plate of what can she do herself or

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,810
what does she need to outsource so yeah

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,419
that

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,970
has thrown up a few challenges in the

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,610
last few months but we're ironing out

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,620
the the creases and things are running

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,950
out so much more smoothly which is what

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,470
you want with WordPress down doing it in

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:53,900
the in a structured way that's what you

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:55,850
want to happen so this is probably the

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,780
whole meat of what I'm going to discuss

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,669
today when I start with a new client and

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,510
actually this is that the areas I look

00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:08,419
at I also do audits for clients who

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,790
aren't ready for a full-blown VA but

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,710
they just want to you know figure out

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,190
what's going on and where their

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,610
constraint line things so the four key

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,370
areas I look at and I see this across

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,680
product and service based businesses

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,400
your operations your marketing your

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,440
sales and your delivery and how you're

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,039
doing your admin for each of those areas

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,770
like some do crossover you know one

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,950
system working in one section can filter

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,280
across to multiple areas but looking at

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:46,550
that and saying okay how can I structure

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,860
how I'm doing this and what tools am I

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,130
using and what does that mean like it

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,830
may not be automated it may still be

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,520
very manual but thinking of how you do

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,860
that step by step day to day and then

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:08,410
adding in the pieces that will make it

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:12,139
run a lot more smoothly so operations

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:16,340
it's kind of a little bit wide yes but I

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,320
think of it more as day to day looking

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,479
after your financials doing your

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,919
day-to-day tasks talking to your

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,570
customers from for my client this

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,120
dramatically changed because they were

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,950
previously doing a lot on social media

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,500
and that was it because their WordPress

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,229
web store their their website was just a

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,990
static piece of the puzzle but when we

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,959
had the new website up a lot of her

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,209
social media was driving people to her

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,519
website

00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:47,379
signing up for online courses signing up

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,119
on the you know contact me via the

00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:54,819
contact form higher rate of blogging all

00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:58,319
the quality reactions changed in to move

00:08:54,819 --> 00:09:01,329
towards the WordPress website and so

00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:03,670
this changed the whole way of whether I

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:07,600
was monitoring the inbox or she was

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:10,449
looking after it or you know new

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,740
inquiries coming through that she didn't

00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:16,269
realize we're coming through a different

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,519
way so this created a whole new gamut of

00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,679
challenges for us because then we had to

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:30,910
sit down okay so who's doing what where

00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:33,189
and when sorry I'm wearing to my nose so

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,350
it's just keeping it at all consistent

00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,569
and sort of looking at okay well with

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,339
financials you know if you have an

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:43,689
e-commerce platform is it feeding into

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:47,470
your into your accounting software if

00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:53,529
not can it just just to take out those

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:56,999
extra steps along the way so the next

00:09:53,529 --> 00:10:00,970
area was marketing and Don this before

00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:04,990
the change of how she was doing her

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:09,579
marketing then drove people to her

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,559
website and how would that look with the

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,809
blogging as I said the blogging then

00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,949
changed like previously you should just

00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,549
throw it up and that was it

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:20,649
but then came the change of others SEO

00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,329
to think of and how does that look and

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,540
what images do I need to add up to make

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:27,549
it look good and all of a sudden she

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,869
went hard that's too hard so that thing

00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:33,339
got handball to me and we had a

00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:35,649
timetable of okay I'll be doing the copy

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,639
this day band has to be ready to go by

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:43,420
this day podcast she added a podcast to

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,970
the mix which wasn't there before so

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,850
then we have now have a podcasting page

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,129
on the website that also ties into with

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,999
call to actions of okay do you like the

00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,370
podcasts

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,960
sign up for my free eCourse here and all

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,720
that sort of thing so

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,180
there was extra levels that the the

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,610
website were now handling that then we

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,620
had to think about all right now I have

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:11,080
to step in or she has to think about how

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:13,540
we approach each of those areas also the

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,560
landing page is actually that and I did

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,899
this for her this week because the

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,279
website now has the e-commerce side with

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:27,640
her subscription base and her course and

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,290
now this week a retreat I then had to be

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,959
creating landing pages for her because

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,850
she didn't know how for starters and

00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,279
also the way the developers built the

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,380
website it's a lot of hard coding in

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,380
there and things like that so for her to

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,160
even attempted yeah she did she just

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,779
went too hard so with my knowledge of

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,320
WordPress I was able to go in there and

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,730
help her get that up and running and

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,630
we're near half booked already this week

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:59,230
so but then with that being now

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,330
applicable she's booked it out looked

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,240
had those extra places there where

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,360
before it was a holes a lot of manual

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,250
calling or emails and things backwards

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,500
and forwards whereas we've just put the

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,400
landing page up and it's going and it's

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,470
done and in actually each time someone

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,990
signs up we've got an automation running

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,670
where it populates a Google sheet for

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,770
her to go okay that person's come

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:29,920
through right where are they up to in

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:32,529
the process of what we need to do so the

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,290
third area is sales and I sort of

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:39,160
touched on this with the Google sheet

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:41,470
having having system having plugins and

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,400
things happening with your website but

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,200
for me personally and I have I recently

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,930
added WooCommerce and I'm going to be

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,610
building some more templates because I

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,130
specialize in G suite and a lot of

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,880
people ask me for my templates and so

00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,190
I've had to add that level into my

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,510
website where that I'm able to sell my

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,959
templates and they're able to go and

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:07,000
download them and that side of things so

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,490
that's now changed for me in

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,220
okay that happens but then what are the

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,740
steps then from that do i automate it so

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,069
then they are able to like that gets

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,589
populated elsewhere for me to manage

00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:23,980
who's buying what and when or for my

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:27,509
client with the membership portal that's

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:31,120
now on her website she gets the new

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,339
signups but it's not automated in

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,769
setting them up as users so then it was

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:38,230
turned to okay am i sending up the years

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,839
is she setting up the users or and how

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,019
is that looking what do the username set

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,569
look like what are the set passwords how

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,629
is that then getting communicated to the

00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:51,699
customer that's now that's now signed up

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,519
and it's all steps that hadn't even

00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:57,160
entered her mind at the time of getting

00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:02,199
this website done that it would change

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,329
how she's doing things also with forms

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,160
on the website she's also got now an

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:09,519
onboarding process because before it was

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,769
just all in in here in her head being

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,629
done manually but now that she has me

00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,809
and also another team member looking at

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:19,689
this she's now got a Google Form that we

00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,910
now use and embed into the Welcome

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,500
emails and all that sort of thing that's

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,959
off the back of the changes that we've

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,899
made on the with the website because

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:38,319
it's completely changed how her whole

00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:41,170
business is running and I'm just

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:43,149
realizing I'm charging through so

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,079
hopefully I'm not exploiting any brains

00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:51,660
or going too quickly and then the fourth

00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:55,509
piece is the delivery and as I mentioned

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:59,559
with my particular client a lot of was a

00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:02,139
lot of it was done on social media and

00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,879
that's now changed because she's now got

00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,040
this evergreen platform with a

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,170
membership site that she's been able to

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,019
upload all her videos or her content

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,269
then sell that as the packaged product

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:16,269
and so she's been able to step out of

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,459
having to do that live all the time in

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,540
social media and the ways that she was

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,760
doing it

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,550
and so that has meant the delivery

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,860
models changed for her product there

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:30,339
also the delivery of she has a

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:34,199
subscription service for SMS messages

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:37,630
which wasn't even in the realm of

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,430
comprehension at the time actually it's

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,550
another one of her lovely brain childs

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:47,260
that we had a moment of okay

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,880
how is that going to happen and so we

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,639
had to map out what that looked like

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,470
okay they went to the website put in

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,420
their details then what would happen for

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,459
that to get into the the platform then

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,769
it needs to to be doing that side of

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:01,839
things but then on top of that where

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,540
else does those contact deep details go

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,260
and who like who's troubleshooting when

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,269
things don't go to plan and so it's it's

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,980
thinking about the processes in the back

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:16,959
that yes some of its automated but then

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,589
you also have to try and catch what's

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,060
not automated and that's you know a lot

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:23,680
of that falls down to the admin person

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,290
that's helping them or to the person

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,569
that is looking at the inbox and going

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,149
oh where's all this coming at and having

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:32,949
that structured alright we need to catch

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:39,730
this now and what's the next step from

00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:42,550
here and also some people some have you

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,220
know you your downloadables are all

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,560
hosted on your work on your website what

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:52,329
does that mean so how is that getting

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,000
from from sign up to the customer so

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:57,100
just thinking about how how your web

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,399
whether your WordPress website can help

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:07,360
you deliver what you're you're selling

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:09,370
to your customers side note I totally

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,860
sit in a florist on a tree stump

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:16,240
thinking like this when I'm thinking of

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:18,880
of admin processes actually you know I

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,189
don't it's actually I don't know of

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,610
anywhere around here that's quite as

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,110
lush and green because you totally do

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,950
that sitting nature when you're thinking

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,780
of Technology

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,540
so how do you use WordPress to

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,040
strengthen your business admin and I

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,680
kind of have touched this all the way on

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,770
this all the way through is thinking

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,950
about how are you doing things right now

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,570
and then looking at it of okay there's

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,190
these really cool plugins around which

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:52,740
we saw in in the session before how can

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,900
I apply that into my business to take

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,590
out those extra little steps along the

00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,350
way so just thinking of how do you do

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,890
your current processes what are in place

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,770
because a lot of things do talk to each

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,810
other if you dig deeper or find the

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,470
little fun little tools that connect

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:16,380
things along the way how does your tie

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,650
website tie into this because websites

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:24,450
used to be a static thing but now

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:26,690
they're not so is your website doing a

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:32,100
lot more than just being a placeholder

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,560
for your for your business and like I

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,560
said where can you create those links

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,050
something might go there directly I know

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,660
a few things you can just integrate

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,840
straightaway but some might take an

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,930
extra few steps and is there an

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,220
opportunity to automate and I've said

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:55,320
this you don't try to automate

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,720
everything there it's all well and good

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,840
to try and yep I'm going to completely

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,650
let go of all this stuff but sometimes

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,400
just keeping your fingers in int in

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,180
touchpoints is handy to have just pick a

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,130
couple of key things and start because I

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,180
expect to people that I do the audits

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,120
for and they're like yeah I just want to

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,010
hands-off and they try and do it and

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,050
it's just overwhelmed because there's so

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,660
many pieces of the moving pieces of the

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,370
puzzle that if one thing fails here then

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,640
what does that mean for the rest down

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,940
the track so and so that gives you the

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,930
chance to continuously tweak and improve

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,930
what you're doing

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,330
[Music]

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,090
okay so I touched on it before there's a

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,970
couple of EA's in the room which is

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:54,530
slightly terrifying so I apologize if I

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:56,240
throw you in it the different VA s do

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,940
different things I'm a techie and

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,540
systems person I work very closely with

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,400
a VA in Sydney who loves calendar

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,250
management and emails and the day-to-day

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,490
stuff you couldn't get me out of there

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,980
fast enough but a lot of people need

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,290
that me included

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,930
my system wise and automate that side of

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:23,060
things because my brain likes to run in

00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,340
little simple flows but when I said I

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,100
was speaking at work camp I throw it out

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,330
to my colleagues in virtually yours

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,570
which is an Australian based network for

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,870
virtual assistants because I only do a

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,900
small very small amount of WordPress

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,090
support work for my clients but I threw

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,310
it out there and said look what are the

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,340
type of things you guys are helping your

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,140
clients with in WordPress because

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,390
there's going to be a room full of

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,210
people who are using WordPress but might

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,820
just want some extra help and so they

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,190
come back to me with a very healthy list

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,130
of things that they're helping their

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,180
clients with and it's sometimes is that

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:11,570
hoc sometimes it's a it's a set thing

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,730
but it's also interesting to note that V

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,370
A's are working in the back of WordPress

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,580
and are able to help with some of the

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,550
things that you might find challenging

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:26,000
so editing pages using themes various

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,880
things I know a favorite amongst a few

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,100
people I know is Debbie and I've

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:35,180
recently just bought it myself to learn

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:39,050
it but I've also got a client who uses

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,100
elemental so yeah I'm using various

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,450
themes that different clients are using

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,130
updating the content and this that's

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,840
usually a really big one because they

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,610
just go look at the backend of WordPress

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,700
and go yeah not not not doing that

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,320
so doing the blogs copy images videos

00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,480
podcast episodes

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,490
Lindell Harris is in the room podcast VA

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,070
so that's that's really hers owner

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:10,450
genius

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:11,620
researching plugins I actually I haven't

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,290
done that myself that was actually

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,300
another suggestion from someone and a

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,520
lot of the time their clients are going

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:22,630
ah what I want it to do this so they

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,820
send our VA s on the some their bas on

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,380
all this to find plugins to do that for

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:31,270
them running the updates and backups

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,850
custom coding there's some VA s in the

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,990
group that wholly specialize in in

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:41,290
WordPress websites which is very cool

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:43,450
basic basic stuff and troubleshooting

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,940
I've had a couple of times with my

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:51,490
client where things just stopped working

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:53,290
so another learning curve so monitoring

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,790
the comments and responses on pages and

00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,870
posts I heard she had this with my

00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,400
client it all used to do it when she was

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,740
on the old website and then all of a

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,110
sudden she was getting just email after

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,440
email after email about the the comments

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:12,460
and she went what's going on I don't

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,470
understand so yeah I think I went in

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,590
there at about 200 comments after she

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,290
finally told me what was going on so

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,870
that was fun

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:25,600
basic SEO SEO keywords analytics

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,150
reporting so a lot of the time they they

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,800
just want to know what's going on but

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,140
don't want to pull the reports or figure

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:37,150
out what's going on embedding of the

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:38,770
forms in from other systems managing the

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,830
e-commerce listing so the product based

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,870
businesses and this last one flagging

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,570
upcoming WordPress events for clients

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,760
that is genuinely a response I had from

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,190
someone so they're stalking the the

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,240
dashboard of WordPress and flagging the

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,240
events for their clients

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,620
so yeah as I said I had been only do a

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,600
small amount of what I went through

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,390
there but yet that our VA is out there

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,350
that also working in WordPress and it

00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,540
trying to find ways that using WordPress

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:16,210
can help streamline that the admins for

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:19,050
their clients because admin takes up so

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,970
much time then why not use a tool that's

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:26,710
you're already using to just streamline

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:32,620
what you're doing day to day so that is

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:36,880
my details yeah I hope that had some

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,520
helpful insights for you you know using

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,550
a virtual assistant isn't scary we are

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,309
humans we are we are in the in the

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,090
trenches so yeah if you have any

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:52,200
questions or ya want some feedback on

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:56,759
just yeah that's where you can find me

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,759
[Applause]

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:10,080
so any questions for Coronel actually

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,220
what we'll do other questions if if we

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,380
could actually come down with the

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,640
question and then it makes it a bit

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,380
easier for us and then we can actually

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:23,130
get you on camera as well you mentioned

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,820
that you are feeding information from

00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:31,710
WordPress into a Google sheet yep

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,900
how are you doing that usually this

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,860
particular client has a we comment has

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,710
WooCommerce and so using zapier so that

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,770
just that bridge between where commerce

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,000
through to Google Google sheet its and

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,480
that's the thing little things like that

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,510
really are simple in it just takes out

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,030
that legwork in between and that's yeah

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,070
and then I can be a lot of time that

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,020
that connection just is enough for my

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,510
clients to go yep we're all over it so

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,419
sort of takes out that time from me

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:06,270
spending doing it manually for them to

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,220
them being a confident with yep that's

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:18,630
just going straight there to their happy

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:34,140
days so yeah any more questions one day

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:35,790
on the frontier hi and things I'm just

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,240
wondering does that actually work with

00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:42,450
other things like databases other than

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:46,530
Google sheet as well I actually couldn't

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:49,110
tell you yeah sorry I've liked a lot of

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:52,049
time when I my clients go I want to do

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,940
this particular thing I go off and

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:57,380
research it and find what the best

00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:01,140
solution is based on what they're doing

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,910
yay for Google in YouTube

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,980
I guess that's probably part and parcel

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,730
being a VA is just being able to you

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,210
know hunt down the solution

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,549
so yes aap is my favorite thing for a

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,730
lot of those connecting bits and pieces

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:17,820
but yeah it just depends on what's yeah

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:24,340
what they're using and what's possible

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:26,470
yeah hi hi Hut how do you charge for

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,679
jobs as a virtual assistant do you

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,120
charge like oh good question

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:37,840
something I should have covered

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:39,610
I personally I'm a per our VA but look

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,669
there's a lower VA s that either do

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,250
blocks of hours so they do say 5 10

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,200
hours in a month or or others do package

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:50,890
rates based on what the deliverables are

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,950
it really does depend on the VA and the

00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:56,919
kind of support they're doing and yeah

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,860
my the network I'm a member of virtually

00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,720
ORS it's kind of starts from $30 and

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,150
upwards depending on their skill sets

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:10,290
and what yeah what exactly you're

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:10,290
looking for because it is so varied cool

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,020
you mentioned that you do G suite

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:21,640
templates sorry where about some way you

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,350
mentioned you do G suite templates

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,650
what's that about

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:31,169
well I am geez I've got my

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:35,919
certifications with G suite so one of my

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,080
most favorite things is being cheap like

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,590
this CRM is out there that are fantastic

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,320
and but a little time my clients they

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,510
have G suite but don't want to pay extra

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,520
subscriptions for all those CRM is out

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:52,150
there so I've actually built quite a few

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,640
CRM and type spread Google sheets that

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,780
they use just to track inquiries and

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,690
things like that because they don't

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:02,530
either a they can't get their head

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:04,570
around full-blown systems or B they just

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,160
want somewhere to easily update

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,549
themselves and see what's going on with

00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,350
particular clients so and I've also it's

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,150
like built social media planning

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,870
templates and things like that that my

00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:19,460
clients just finds just easy to use

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,100
easier to use and a full-blown system so

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,550
yeah I've had quite a few requests to

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,170
get the templates happening so that way

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:34,520
they just can do it without having to

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:37,610
think about it yeah you mention years up

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,490
here for a lot of your integrations how

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,690
do you approach handling like privacy of

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,960
data information when you're going

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:48,880
cross-platform and if you use like

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:53,120
third-party or various connection points

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,960
to be honest a lot of time I give the

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,610
the advice to my client and they go with

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,200
what they want feel is right because

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,760
sometimes they even go yeah I'm not

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,310
comfortable with that happening so then

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,800
we go back to a manual option so it

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,000
really does depend on my client and what

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,770
they want to do and what they want to

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,970
achieve so yeah I don't go in there

00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:16,280
going yeah go across all multiple places

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,500
just because it's something they have to

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,180
be comfortable with and ok with in terms

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,310
of the privacy stuff and things like

00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,920
that so yeah a lot of the time they're

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,900
like yeah that's fine but yeah if they

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,890
don't want to do it we don't so it's

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,890
really dependent on them

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,990
I'd love the idea of having a virtual

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,810
assistant to handle all my admin but I'm

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:50,090
a massive control freak oh yeah and I

00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:53,600
was terrified of the idea of letting

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:57,020
someone yep do that stuff yep how do we

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,940
actually task someone like you because

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,160
half the time I feel like if I would

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,320
take the time to describe what I need

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,480
done yeah it's kind of already done

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:11,030
anyway yeah and then I'm like how do I

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,880
keep that private and secure yeah I feel

00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:16,340
like a lot of my clients I like that and

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,080
they're like I don't wanna let go or

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,720
yeah I don't like the idea of letting

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,910
someone into everything so it usually it

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,780
starts with one thing and then once they

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:28,870
get that that that trust they go okay

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,640
well then can you do this as well

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:35,330
virtually yours the network I'm a member

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:38,240
of Rosie has a lot of resources for for

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,360
people who want to outsource so I'm yeah

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,010
I'm a VA I'm the doing the do but a lot

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,290
of her resources run through a lot of

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,200
that and give you ideas on how you can

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,870
think about where to start or where do

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,610
you what do you want to get help with so

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,570
yeah I could recommend having a look at

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,570
some of the stuff on her website

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:10,970
Oh Oh is there one more is that it yeah

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:13,190
one more thank you quickly as a VA how

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:17,930
do you compete on an international basis

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:22,310
because of your competitive prices I run

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:27,170
on the theory that there's enough for

00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:29,630
everyone so I don't even try and that's

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:32,930
a lot of thing a lot of that we find is

00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:35,720
the people I work with they want someone

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,430
based in Australia and they understand

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,200
that the cost of living and all that

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,960
sand the everything on that side of

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,850
things doesn't compete anywhere near

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,860
what the overseas VA is have so yeah

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:52,700
then there are instances where yes you

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:54,380
could go overseas but the the the

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,480
culture barriers the language barriers

00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:01,400
the quality of work yeah it all it all

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,780
difference so much so I run on the

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,570
theory that you you get what you pay for

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,610
and yeah if you want someone that you

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,950
can wholly trust and beast in the you

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,850
know in the same time zone and

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:15,260
understand the business environment then

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:20,570
that's what Australian based base V ice

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:22,010
for yep excellent well that's that's a

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,750
