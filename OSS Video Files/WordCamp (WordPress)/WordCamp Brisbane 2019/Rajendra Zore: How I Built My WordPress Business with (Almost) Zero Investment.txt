there wouldn't have been so many claps

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,170
he if he would have taken my full name

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,470
which is Rajan Rougerie and which is

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,920
apparently Rizzo by then all right so I

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,340
guess my click Berry title have pulled a

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,150
good set of audience today and with

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,980
almost empty room I was quite nervous as

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,199
soon as the people start walking in I

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,390
kind of started getting some pumped up

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,040
and confident like okay I'll kill it I

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,430
don't know let's see but before before

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,250
we could get started I want to know my

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:53,940
audience from this it's not working or

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:57,449
it's okay just just solopreneurs in the

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,120
house we all are most of us anyone doing

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,730
WordPress business we all all right I do

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,379
that all the time even if I'm running a

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,750
multi-million dollar business today

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,460
I was once a solopreneur that is how I

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,680
started and that is all I'm going to

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:19,060
talk about so P people are still joining

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,940
so okay

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,940
so today I'm going to cover some of the

00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,549
business practices which probably you

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,810
know I have done tried tested failed

00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,520
multiple times so I I have finally

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,460
realized that there are certain best

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,970
practices that every individual who is

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,280
planning to get into business or even

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,040
even if they are working on some kind of

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,430
a leadership profile they should have

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,429
these practices well done well practice

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,080
and well tested with their set of

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:57,550
audiences so every every practice that

00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,860
I've mentioned here from personal

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,289
branding to customer advocacy to ethics

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,740
to transparency it's all very generic

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,920
keywords but I'm going to put some of my

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,739
real stories how how it all worked with

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,069
me for my businesses so before I get

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:20,290
with that this is me Rajan Desiree not

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:22,630
Rizzo you all can call me Raj and you

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,290
can connect me on social media almost

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,430
everywhere haven't tried tinder yet but

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,600
other than that I'm almost everywhere

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,500
yeah that's that's pretty much my

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,280
professional journey and this morning I

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,530
tweeted about like how I started from

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,720
McDonald's in back in 2007 when I

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,430
dropped out of my college I'm still an

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,290
undergrad so I'm really sorry I'm

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,370
already intimidated with such a big

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,790
classrooms big respect to professor's so

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,459
I dropped out and I could manage to get

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,750
first job in McDonald's they were the

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,000
only ones who got impressed with the

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,549
fact that I'm dropped out they gave me

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,130
the job thanks I enjoyed myself there

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:07,480
were free employee meal and I always

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,570
used to wait for that after cleaning

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,900
some toilets but that is how pretty much

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,989
I started and had all sorts of odd jobs

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,600
until I cracked myself into background

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,489
screening and I was doing some profile

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,060
checks and due diligence and whatnot I

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:28,300
don't know why that came into my you

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,680
know my professional journey but it has

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,010
taught me a lot because I was dealing

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,769
with clients I was dealing

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,239
of due diligence and profile checks and

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,739
stuff like that so it has given me a

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,709
different level of confidence and

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,590
understanding with the industry moving

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,650
on I after after leaving that career I

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,260
was almost two years unemployed and I

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,250
decided to kind of leave my city I'm

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,370
from India

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,069
so I stay in Mumbai and I decided to

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,530
move that and move out to a new city I'm

00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,659
the bird I find a job there but got

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,980
kicked out after five months because of

00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:09,139
the incompetency yeah so ironically my

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,450
profile was business head my boss

00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:13,819
thought I have no clue what I'm doing

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,729
and he kicked me out saying that you're

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,729
incompetent you should go back you know

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:22,250
I was like okay thank you for your

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,470
feedback but I might going to stick

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,550
around in this city for a while and

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,590
after he kicked me out and staying on

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,080
street for a couple of nights I figured

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,729
out that it's about time I should put my

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,010
foot down and probably just start

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:40,070
something of my own

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,760
that is when it strikes me that how bad

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:47,419
my career path was I haven't worked any

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,780
time in any IT industry it was all non

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,479
IT jobs I tried myself but you know back

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,070
in my country if your undergraduate you

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,410
straight away get unqualified like you

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,610
know and I'm still a dropout time's

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,169
running I've built multiple startups

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,570
currently running run cloud which is a

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,370
multi-million dollar company and our

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,949
product has been used in 80 plus country

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,750
so I want to thank my boss who said I

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,860
was incompetent as a business developer

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:20,240
I started questioning myself hard until

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,190
I become CMO of run cloud and trying to

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,370
figure out with my own business strategy

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,080
how I can make it big so you guys

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,520
remember the title right you can go on

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,430
my Twitter also a lot of click baby

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,870
stuff I had been added over there but

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:40,250
the point is all this is real I was

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,409
homeless in the new city I I have tried

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,440
a lot of lot of things you know whenever

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,440
you you are

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,380
hopeless helpless all you do is Google

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,300
you know I have done my share of Google

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,780
and I realized that it's not working for

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,840
me

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,570
so let me just try and fail myself and

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,190
learn and probably come the day when

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,870
I'll be able to share this thing so

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,790
probably this is kind of a first hand

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:08,340
that I'm sharing okay so this is pretty

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,650
much just a show of kind of infographic

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,570
or something but it worked on social

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,570
media I got a bear lights and all that

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:24,870
okay so as I said that these things

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,580
anyone remember this will be Shawshank

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,080
Redemption yeah

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,120
loved it best one best one especially

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,370
when you're low in life such movies

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,190
works for you okay and for some goddamn

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,950
reason you get so interested in every

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,570
dialogues like okay dude this is related

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,870
to my life like suddenly everything is

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:54,180
related to your life so this thought has

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,220
you know it helped me because all this

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,140
while when when probably one night when

00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,669
I was just homeless and sitting in that

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,150
new city wondering what I'm going to do

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,070
next

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,550
there was this hope that everything is

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,020
going to work out fine you know and

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,970
suddenly one of my friends suggested me

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,190
this movie and I was like oh dude this

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,169
movie is like a retargeting they just

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,900
retargeted me and giving this good

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:20,430
dialogue you know on hope so this is

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:24,720
this is the code that I go by okay now

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,680
moving on this doesn't move on fast I

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,780
just clicked it but dude you have to

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,210
move on yeah so coming down to business

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,280
let's start with personal branding how

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,960
many of you understand what personal

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:46,410
branding is are you guys on Twitter yeah

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,750
and what is your first move with

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,100
personal branding is it doing social

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:59,010
media right or just starting a blog okay

00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,810
doing social media right just starting a

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,180
blog because I want to get into my

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,680
personal branding stuff and I know a

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,240
little bit of English and thanks to

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:13,110
grammerly Oh Graham only saves me all

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,740
the time I'm like went gone and won't it

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,760
just correct me dude you're wrong yeah

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,370
all right so personal branding so I'm

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,250
not going to give all listicles and all

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,470
that let me tell you a story now I have

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,550
a lot of stories by the way struggles

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:35,490
give you a lot of stories enough so I

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,380
started my first company in 2012 the

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,180
first big lesson I learned in the

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:45,300
business industry is partners they can

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,570
screw you up anytime happen to me I

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,450
learned my lesson I moved on and in 2015

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,780
I decided to start exploring this new

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,150
buzz word called solopreneur sure did I

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,260
promise he hated that right I practiced

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:05,070
it okay so solopreneur sure it was like

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,770
Lone Ranger like what if there's no one

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,410
to help me out will I be able to do my

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,150
business myself right so that kind of a

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,730
thought came in my mind I started

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,280
listing down every possible skill set

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,020
that I that I learn in my first business

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,910
and everything all the good and bad

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,200
experiences all the technical skills

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:28,830
everything and I started my next venture

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,230
which was host my blog when I started

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,820
host my blog thanks to my fiance we she

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,920
helped me with the nomenclature I was

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,720
totally confused I was like I want to

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,130
start something but what's something you

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,240
know that has to be channelized

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,580
so that started with

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,350
the first step was the personal branding

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,850
you know the importance of personal

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,340
branding I'm not sure Steve job must

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,430
have said this thing but you know we we

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,230
all are driven by the Apple products and

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,240
there are so many other products they

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,940
are emotionally connected with it's all

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,970
branded you know some of the people I

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,930
met online that like super cool like the

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,590
next Avengers

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,560
I made them offline and they're so

00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:15,620
awkward they're like dude I thought

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:18,230
you're a Batman yeah so branding is

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,540
really important you as a solopreneur

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,000
you as an individual business person you

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,170
cannot sell your brand just just accept

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,560
that fact but you can sell yourself not

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,680
in whatever the way in a good way you

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:39,110
know the name should be sold out right

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:42,200
so for me personally is when you create

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,500
yourself all right and then you connect

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,910
your brand you give your brand a voice

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,850
right you cannot go the other way around

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,030
unless you have VCS coming right from

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,560
Silicon Valley okay until then you have

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,780
to build your own self and build your

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,250
own credibility right so many of you

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,590
must have searched my profile that who

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,480
the hell is a let's go for a chat or go

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,040
you know let's go for his talk if he

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,500
bugs us we will walk out in the next

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,720
five minutes so it's all about branding

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,030
it's all about how you put yourself out

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,530
but how do you do that I mean Google

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:17,630
gives you silly ins of options to do

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,060
branding and when I started the first

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,340
thing was start your blog I like dude I

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,220
can't write and what do I write you know

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,150
and at that point of time the grammarly

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,250
was not that famous

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,400
it was later I realized they have free

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,400
plan and I started using it but that was

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:39,470
not a choice when I started so back in

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,980
2015 I met this person okay person with

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,900
thousand followers on Twitter and she

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,790
was just thousand followers on Twitter

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,850
but all the all that Starbucks meeting

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,290
duration she was acting like a celeb I

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,169
paid for her coffee

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,869
okay and I'm like thousand followers why

00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:02,149
that's a big deal you know she's not

00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,649
interested in what I am trying to convey

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,029
to her that okay this is the social

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,040
media project would you be interested in

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,600
taking and she is selling me the

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,449
thousand follower thing I don't

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,579
understand and I'm like what is this is

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:18,169
it some kind of a new trend or what it

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:21,410
is May 2015 I decided to take Twitter

00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:23,479
seriously I started with around 69 70

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,539
followers at that point of time I had no

00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:29,449
clue how this thing works but here's

00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:31,729
what I did so this is the first step of

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,039
your personal branding okay please don't

00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:35,239
force yourself to write a blogs okay

00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,839
there are there are so many blogs

00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:40,669
already start creating something that

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,429
brings your voice out like I can't write

00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,359
I don't want to pretend writing even you

00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,179
know I don't want to start a blog

00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:48,410
immediately alright but I I definitely

00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:50,179
want to make sure that how I'm

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,619
contributing that people are noticing me

00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,839
they want to listen to me they want to

00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:55,669
follow me right so this is what I have

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,629
done I have decided to take Twitter

00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:02,269
seriously so Twitter Facebook tinder was

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:06,459
not on my list right first yeah so hit

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,459
Twitter Facebook and Instagram

00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:11,779
I still don't do that right but Twitter

00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,910
and Facebook or serious and but at that

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,949
point of time in 2015 I thought Twitter

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,600
is good

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,779
celebrities are there everyone is

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,819
talking there let me focus that point so

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,829
that thing that says that pick one

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:27,379
social media outlet it is really

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:30,049
important don't try to be everywhere

00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,249
creating your magic you know it's not

00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,619
going to happen if you are just getting

00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:35,059
started or you are an offline celebrity

00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:37,459
already and people are looking for you

00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:40,249
everywhere so if you are an individual

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:43,399
pick one channel where you think your

00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:46,039
community is for me in 2015 it was

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,449
Twitter I started with 69 to 70

00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:54,109
followers and the first strategy was the

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:56,809
bio okay not some I don't want to study

00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:58,729
like that sort of faux bio you have to

00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,559
be clean with what you do what you're

00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:02,779
going to deliver what your profile is

00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,189
all about some kind of a info that

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,139
people will find that you're you're not

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,750
a spammer or your

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,060
just a just a personality would

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,769
disappear sometime or tied to DM the

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,139
first thing hey babes how are you kind

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,199
of a star you have to be real realistic

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:21,320
you know so that is how the first step

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,540
started I started building my social

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,850
profiles well good picture I don't look

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,620
good but the pictures look good okay

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,180
so I started with that and then I

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,670
decided to stick to Twitter until I

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,509
figure that damn thing out okay and then

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:40,910
I was like tweeting is not helping Artie

00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:43,430
yeah it is helping a little bit but

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,709
tweeting just random things not helping

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,620
like Monday motivation Wednesday wisdom

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,930
is not doing well so what I did I

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,910
decided to myself to pick a niche now

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,560
some people call it niche I call it

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,060
niche let's take donation

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,480
I picked a niche and I was like what am

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,329
I good at nothing okay but what I'm

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
interested in I'm interested in digital

00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,769
marketing I'm interested in WordPress

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,980
because I have already figured that out

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,560
in my first business and some of the

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,199
start of things whatever just just go

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,380
with the flow so for me it was important

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:24,649
to pick some kind of keywords that I am

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,260
interested in I done that first the next

00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,769
thing I did was Twitter chat it still

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,100
works

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:33,560
if you guys really want to experiment

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,690
just pick couple of Twitter chats there

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,540
are some great Twitter charge that

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,610
happens across SEO and digital marketing

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,829
and you know other other interesting

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,060
topics you know just pick couple of them

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,670
two three max and just be a part of it

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,639
just by doing and being a part of

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,939
Twitter chat I managed to get more than

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,610
1000 followers in three weeks so

00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:01,550
whatever that celebrity who got the free

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,550
Starbucks coffee from me I just outrank

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,550
her in just three weeks so what was it

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,569
all about it was all about you know

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,639
being in the community learning from the

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:15,380
community and then giving back to the

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,730
community for example when I started

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,459
Twitter chat

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,510
let's say SEM rush hashtag SEM rush I

00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:25,130
had no clue how this thing is going I

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,670
started being the silent member of the

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,589
Twitter chat I started learning and then

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,930
from second or third chat I started

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,510
contributing back the best part was the

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,730
questions were revealed way before the

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,399
Twitter chat so I used to just do Google

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,769
you know Google is everywhere the first

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,269
rescue point so I used to do Google I

00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,670
used to keep all my answers ready and

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,250
I'm like dude I'm ready to talk here and

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,410
my answer used to get RT is and likes

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,670
and what not and I'm like followers and

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,709
followers and followers they thought

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,440
that I'm an expert I'm like okay that's

00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,690
working for me you know but the point is

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,610
I don't want that I mean I don't want

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,230
the fake followers I want to learn I

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,760
want to make sure that by that time they

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,130
realize this guy was faking

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,620
I should be real you know so that

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:13,790
learning part is on you but how to get

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,780
started it's this Facebook group until

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,870
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,870
I thought Facebook is like my uncle or

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,569
my aunt or my parents and everyone that

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,890
I'm running away from other on Facebook

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:28,790
until I figure out there are some

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:32,290
amazing Facebook groups again focused on

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:35,540
my interest so I started with one group

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,429
then Facebook started running the magic

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,850
of suggesting me the groups that are

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:43,940
relevant to my interest I started adding

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:48,260
myself to almost every dude you have to

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:53,510
still be there it's like get done

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:56,530
already so all right so I need to keep

00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:01,160
clicking this button so it doesn't sleep

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:03,500
okay so facebook group i starded myself

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,390
in one of this wordpress group Facebook

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,030
started suggesting me some relevant

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,530
groups and I started adding myself to

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,230
that as well now apparently I when I

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,450
joined WordPress I realized that I have

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,929
been doing WordPress since 2012 and

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,450
there is so much I don't know

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:25,700
then I again get back to my old strategy

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,049
of being the silent member learning from

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,520
the other members learning from the

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,590
queries that are coming in the group and

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,500
then

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:37,180
giving back to the community this

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,090
practice helped me to not just become

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,580
one of the prominent member of the

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,980
WordPress groups and of course being a

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,220
nation or being an Indian you will first

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,650
be seen as a spammer I made my way out

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,890
I got blocked to multiple times I

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,780
requested admin I was not even known

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,370
spamming there was genuine question but

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:02,620
Eurasian your spammer

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:07,830
so that's still there okay but I made my

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:11,440
way out and not just I become one of the

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,500
contributor or a good member and not a

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,810
spammer I also got promoted as the

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,600
moderator and admin and in today's time

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:22,990
I am the admin to multiple WordPress

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,510
groups which are which are the world's

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,460
top WordPress groups on Facebook I am

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,320
one of the admins and we are running the

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,990
community of over 100,000 members

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,240
worldwide so that was one of the

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,550
milestones and I started learning how to

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,680
interact with people because even if

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,300
it's one community every individual is

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,970
different the problems are different

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,940
even if just WordPress site the problems

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:50,140
are totally different and giving back

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,210
has helped me a lot so here how I

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,790
started leveraging so I am now a

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,070
superstar on Twitter I'll show you why I

00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,140
said superstar I got an award also I

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,640
don't look like an award winner but I

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:06,520
got an award and I started leveraging

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,530
the next step is once you build the

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,560
website the next step is of course how

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:14,200
you can promote it and leverage it you

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,470
know you you get a business out of it my

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,840
point of business was being better in

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,400
this being better in giving back to the

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,380
community and that is what I started

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,100
doing so now if you check my Twitter

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,860
it's 4,000 plus followers okay just

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,110
consider me as a seller already and then

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,120
the second thing I started doing is I

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,490
start showing some good interest in

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,290
other people's story we all have stories

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,420
if I'll ask you each one of you how you

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,190
started with WordPress you'll have

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,770
amazing story to share

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,600
like I I don't have an amazing story but

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,480
the foolish story is I started with the

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,450
local environment on BAM and one of this

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,040
great guy he gave me his website my

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,690
company didn't even had a name at that

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,150
point of time but he trusted me for I

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,810
don't know why he trusted me he gave me

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,820
his website to build I didn't had any

00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,710
clue like okay this is a theme forest

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,930
Wow the website is already built what am

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,330
I supposed to do in that should I call

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,520
it a widget or a bigot you know so I was

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,820
totally confused like what is plug-in

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,610
what to plug in and from there I was

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,350
totally clueless and that cluelessness

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,870
led me to build that website again and

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,930
again and again for 50 times you know

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,610
but I figured my way out I learned how

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,900
the WordPress works what is plug-in and

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,060
what is themes and everything is free

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,140
Wow and you still learn out of it

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:37,630
so I started showing some equally

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,880
interest in other stories understanding

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,610
how they started some plug-in authors

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,170
they are like I mean we have to accept

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,460
the fact if a person is too intelligent

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,680
he cannot market himself

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,110
okay I'm not intelligent I'm working on

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,670
marketing myself you know so at that

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,280
point of time I came across so many

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,290
plugins and these plugins were brilliant

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,540
but these guys were not reaching out to

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,940
the community and I had the power of

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,520
groups and more than hundred thousand

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,250
global users of WordPress I was like

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,090
okay let's let's start helping them

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,530
understanding their story understanding

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,770
what kind of a solution they are

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,570
providing I started suggesting and

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,370
recommending them not promoting or

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,310
endorsing them there was no money

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:21,900
involved any point of time but any

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:26,410
anyone using Astra BlogWorld

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,850
any anyone using blog walls and Astra

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,220
and all that stuff okay

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:33,370
these are couple of plugins that I i

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,880
heavily recommended to people after all

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,370
the tests that I do so it is really

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,450
important when you are in a community

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,090
don't think that the other person is

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,970
going to take on your knowledge or going

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,460
to use you just be free share your

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,800
knowledge and the execution is the key

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,120
even if you share your entire strategy

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,010
don't expect that person to

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,930
run the show exactly the way you might

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,510
okay so you're that you're a champion

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:02,630
with your own strategy so don't don't be

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,390
like limited be helpful contribute back

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,270
join join the community join the Twitter

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,220
chat and in no time you will realize

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,430
that there are so many people interested

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,470
in what you're doing you know and that

00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,850
is going to give you give back a

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,880
leverage to your brand

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:29,050
whichever brand you are running really

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,179
so how many of you already acknowledged

00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:38,120
when I say that humanize your brand on

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:39,679
social media right right we are moving

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,450
to robots but we still want the

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,910
humanized approach you know so how did I

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,890
I leveraged my personal branding or

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,650
whatever I have done and how did I start

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,080
making business so when I started host

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,290
my blog back in October 2015 until

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,750
December 2015 I had two clients those

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,090
two clients I gave my service free like

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:05,570
free domain free hosting those were my

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,940
two clients for next eight months I had

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,809
no business in host my blog I was doing

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:15,380
every possible thing but I was doing it

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:17,150
wrong I forgot all the things that I

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,920
have done right with my personal

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,650
branding and doing wrong with my brand

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,340
the first wrong thing I was doing is I

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,429
was not leveraging my social status to

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,980
promote my brand to talk my knowledge

00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:33,290
out the second thing wrong I was doing

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,800
is I was just blindly posting things on

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,040
Twitter

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,800
I was not engaging with them so on 10th

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,020
of August 2016

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,900
after almost like 8 to 10 months of

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:48,050
hibernation more of my business I

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:52,040
cracked the code for my business with

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:54,920
this one twit this one trade has created

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,650
a great conversation online on my

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,960
Twitter account and from there onward

00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,810
the blogger started noticing that there

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,700
is something called host my blog the

00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:07,130
first impression was they loved the name

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,230
because it was too personal like

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,690
host my blog it was so personal for them

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,780
so that that's again a magic of branding

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:17,750
because initially I thought I'll make it

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:21,530
let's blog my fiance said you're stupid

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,780
let's be post my blog so you know women

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,520
they always win of course they're

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,280
intelligent and thanks to her this brand

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,559
is doing amazingly well and currently

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm managing more than 500 WordPress

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,370
sites under this brand so this is one of

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,900
the most preferred when it comes to you

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,710
know the bloggers trusting with their

00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:45,350
decades-old blog they go to Raj again

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,750
they go to Raj they still go to Raj this

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,340
they don't go to over spy blog okay so

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,990
if you go on my Facebook page if you'll

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,990
read everything it's all start with Raj

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,940
so that's the magic of personal branding

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,890
that's the magic of bringing your

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,190
personal branding leveraging that and

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:04,960
humanizing your brand which is in my

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,960
case it was host my blog at that product

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,059
honestly I don't know what's next in my

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,880
slide oh wow yeah this is what I was

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,919
talking about so I was doing my thing I

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,669
don't know I was doing it right I was

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,590
doing it wrong

00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:21,620
but I was just doing my thing like the

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,390
Twitter ping Twitter chat I I used to

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,370
participate in some of the chats which

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,960
were four o'clock in the morning or 6

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,940
o'clock in the morning I'm not I'm not a

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,950
morning person but I don't know I was

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,049
obsessed with the follower things and

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,520
real followers they're talking every

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,350
morning I used to wake up with our days

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:40,360
and likes and all that I don't know I

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:43,039
was in that zone so I was doing my thing

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,980
leveraging that humanizing my brand and

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,470
all that traction which was coming some

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,020
of the agencies they were watching how

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,600
these guys doing things right you know

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,990
and they awarded me as one of the power

00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,400
digital users of India in 2016 they

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,400
didn't really give me the trophy

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,789
it's okay all right so this is from my

00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:11,799
LinkedIn profile just a testimonial so

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,929
that whatever I'm babbling for past I

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:17,529
don't know how many minutes there's a

00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:20,429
support to that it's true okay so the

00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:24,609
mark Parkinson is one of my clients and

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:26,379
the other guy Satheesh is my classmate

00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,989
from college the same college I dropped

00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:32,109
out he graduated his masters now I'm

00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:34,269
still don't have degree but they ignore

00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:37,749
heads whatever I do so they left their

00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:40,029
recommendation yeah so I'm real now

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:42,729
comes customer advocacy do you guys know

00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:45,399
what is customer advocacy is yeah not

00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:48,340
the lawyers who are advocates but in our

00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:50,019
business we need advocates again not the

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,779
legal advocates we need the customer

00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:55,749
advocates how do you build that customer

00:27:52,779 --> 00:28:01,960
advocacy you know go Google you'll find

00:27:55,749 --> 00:28:05,139
hundreds I think these things works when

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,789
I struggle hard my brand went on the

00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:09,220
hibernation mode for ten months

00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,849
the only thing work at that point of

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:15,389
time was humanizing it why be inhuman

00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:18,970
when the user is there on your platform

00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:23,649
yeah why disappear and be a robot so I

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:26,529
focused on two things I I was and this

00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:29,080
is this is the practices it is not just

00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:31,389
with my WordPress business it is also

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,639
followed with my SAS business which is a

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,529
multi-million dollar company today right

00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:37,570
so these are the things it's not just

00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:39,639
element limited to WordPress business

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,169
it's it's it's like the practices you

00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,840
have to follow probably it will help you

00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:45,759
in your personal life too so I started

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,220
focusing on the customer centric

00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,840
approach I wanted to make sure that once

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,149
they are on board I want to make sure I

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,769
am delivering the best you might feel at

00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:56,200
one point that I am not earning so much

00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:58,929
out of it why should I do it you know

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,940
but you never know by doing that and not

00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,999
earning out of it you might earn a

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,129
lifelong loyalist customer and they will

00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:08,259
go out and they will become your brand

00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:10,599
advocates they will do the word of mouth

00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:12,280
and word of mouth is still powerful and

00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:14,980
better than

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,760
couple of ads on Facebook and wasting

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,850
your money on it and have all kind of

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,840
spam likes so I was focused on customer

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,550
need and the customer support I don't

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,730
think you need anything else once the

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,460
customer is in stop I mean okay we have

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,840
this swags and everything is okay but

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,550
you are not giving the good support

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,710
you're not you don't even have the good

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,690
services what they require you're just

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,450
sending them the good swags and greeting

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,130
cards and everything they would like you

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,050
alright so you have to first focus on

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,360
your core business and your services

00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:52,600
what you're offering when I started I

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:57,040
started at $18 per your service which

00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:00,040
included domain name hosting and site

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,650
migration site migration from bloggers

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,860
and wordpress.com is okay site migration

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:09,280
from Wix you know feel some pity for me

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,230
Wix and I did that I was up all night I

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,690
was doing that you know and what am I

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,810
getting out of it no profit at all $18

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,430
Poyer can you imagine then that was who

00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,770
kicked me he was right I don't know how

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:25,780
to do business but what am I really

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:27,430
doing I was doing a job where I build my

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,650
personal brand I build my name or

00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:33,430
thority and then I'll focus on the

00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:35,650
earning part right now I need voice wise

00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,370
that can go say that this Raj guy is

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,820
good

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:42,160
I cannot hire 10 marketing managers but

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,710
what I can do is I can give best service

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,020
to my initial clients my first clients

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,620
they will go and advocate my brand and

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:55,510
that is what has happened

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:58,210
so as the best example back in August

00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,240
2016 I showed you the tweet after that

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,200
particular twit 10th August tweet

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,870
everything started working out really

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,380
well and by the end of that year I had

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:11,260
more than 100 signups and hundred

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,810
bloggers on your platform it's a big

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,190
thing people hire them as the influence

00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,010
of marketing and these guys have been

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,770
marketing me for free why because of the

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,090
customer centric approach yeah they

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,770
turned themselves because they are happy

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,140
they turned themselves as a brand and

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,940
okay

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,559
started doing the word-of-mouth and they

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,960
started bringing their own friends in

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,970
you know so I picked up a good niche

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,040
it's like you know you you touch one

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,690
person and everything gets affected that

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,520
sort of a thing so I started getting

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,850
good recommendation people started

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,990
joining us and by December I was just

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,690
doing hosting domain and site migration

00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:51,410
January 2017 as a result of customer

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:55,150
advocacy I got an email from one of the

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:59,660
top influencers in India the bloggers

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:01,970
she said that Raj I know how to do the

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,090
WordPress and everything but I keep busy

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,860
why don't you maintain my blog I was

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,200
like what is maintaining the blog means

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,809
I was not aware that there is

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,940
maintenance service or that particular

00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:18,530
segment exists you know because I was

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,690
relatively new so I started researching

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,340
about it like she said maintain my blog

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,500
how do I maintain my home maintain her

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,210
blog you know then I realize okay you

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,860
have to take care of the updates and

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,230
other things you know what I used to do

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,660
I used to individually go to the sites

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:36,140
and do the updates ignorant I don't know

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:40,520
know right knowledge you know so again

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,320
went back to my first learning way which

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,270
worked for me in the personal branding

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,690
by joining the groups and all that what

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,929
did I do

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,660
I joined the relevant groups and I came

00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,460
across main WPF and I came across the

00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,110
people who are managing hundreds of

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,120
WordPress sites and how are they

00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,100
managing it they have the centralized

00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:02,870
system so the first thing I learned from

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,220
my customer was maintenance business the

00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,559
second thing I learned that there are

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,150
centralized system say we are in the

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,190
WordPress where but there is so much we

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,929
don't know about even if the plugin that

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,270
we are using there are so many settings

00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:15,919
we just ignore and later through such

00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,230
sessions we realize that oh my god

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,540
that's a that setting was so useful you

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:23,110
know so it is it is more like if you

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,510
know you know everything you're all

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:27,919
there is still a lot to know so I came

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:31,340
across this centralized management

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,990
system I started diving more and more

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:38,720
into the WordPress

00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:42,780
business okay so that clickbait a title

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,120
$18 per year it still exists but I

00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:48,600
focused on my multiple streams of

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,730
revenue all right so multiple streams I

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,340
am still not disappointing my existing

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,350
customer since 2015 and 2016 they're

00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,320
still getting the service at $18 per

00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,960
year but I have figured my way out on

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,050
multiple streams of revenue and my

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,140
wordpress maintenance business is giving

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,879
me thousands of dollars per year and

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,760
currently I'm managing as I said more

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,879
than 500 WordPress sites and my

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,060
clientele includes the top bloggers and

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,649
the celebrities from news anchor to the

00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,450
person who is working with the prime

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,780
minister and stuff like that so everyone

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:26,840
started trusting me now those people

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,090
they wouldn't go and trust host my blog

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,310
they will trust the person who is

00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,350
recommending me and then they will go

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,330
check my profile first and then they

00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,419
will go on my branding that is how it

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,490
all works and that is how I got many of

00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:43,500
these big profile clients they were like

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,409
okay you got recommended by so-and-so

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,050
person we know and we went on your

00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,940
profile and we liked your brand it was

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,290
never like okay she recommended we went

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,970
to your website and everything and we

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,260
like no we want to know the person

00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,390
behind it because we are giving you our

00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,240
website back-end access as lot of

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:03,420
secrets in it that is how I built my

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,220
WordPress business and that is what that

00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,330
thousands of dollars in revenue means

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:12,630
you know that is how it built but again

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,760
there was one sector section which I was

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,190
meaning to explore this is just a

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,170
testimonial to impress you guys so these

00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,440
are the testimonials my customers leave

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:25,109
on my Facebook page it's been how many

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,570
years four years and still 100% customer

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:28,890
satisfaction ratio there is one

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,500
incidence I want to share with you guys

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:34,859
how customer advocacy has helped me in

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,590
2017 one of the client or one of the

00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:38,910
bloggers she was really pissed off I

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,010
don't know why maybe she was not

00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,420
understanding some technicalities which

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,490
we were trying to make her understand

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,810
and she was just blaming the brand and

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,400
that's okay you know

00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,970
we have to face one of such kind to

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,270
learn now she went on Twitter and

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:58,070
started negatively influencing others

00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:01,350
now where was I and what I was doing

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,600
from my host my blog profile I tried to

00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,970
calm her down I try to suggest her ways

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,210
out she was not ready she made up her

00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:17,160
mind that DoDEA screwed up who helped me

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:20,400
who helped me so it was my customers who

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,040
went twitted back and said that we are

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,110
good this is what it is and that is how

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,870
without me coming there and talking to

00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,420
them there were tens and hundreds of my

00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,040
own users they went on Twitter and her

00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,560
twits were completely disappeared from

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,900
there so that is how and that is the

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,150
power of customer advocacy so let me run

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,720
the game is over stop ethics and

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:45,810
transparency we all are ethical right

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,800
ethical people raise your hand I just

00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:51,390
wanted everyone to raise their hand so

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,830
with ethics and transparency what I mean

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,530
is just keep it simple

00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,240
okay don't complicate things don't lie

00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,650
to your clients they know everything

00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,020
they have done their research and they

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,090
came to you just be honest to them and

00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,550
make sure if you are an individual

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,470
person who is running the show make sure

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,630
you are not providing the services that

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,540
can lock them out if you get hit by the

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,830
bus okay so we all are humans we all are

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,720
going to die or something on the other

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,850
is going to happen to us please make

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,100
sure the services are not locking them

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:22,920
out that is how I stopped my domain

00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,980
services and currently my main stream of

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,430
revenue is the site maintenance and the

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,380
cloud hosting alright so these are the

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:37,100
tools that I use and yeah any questions

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,100
because the game is over

00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:48,799
thank you I'm sorry

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:51,269
should I just think okay questions here

00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:57,869
you guys were having a questions or what

00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:58,769
I was too clear no but throw some

00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:04,960
questions at me

00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:06,920
let me embarrass myself Oh gentlemen

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,479
[Music]

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:14,609
just know that mr. bean okay

00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:17,099
Mika um how did you go so you're talking

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:18,739
about you first establishing your own

00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,479
personal brand and then tying it into

00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:23,940
pushing and supporting a business friend

00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:25,799
how did you go about transitioning from

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,440
that because I find it a bit icky and

00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:30,180
awkward sort of putting I've built

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,930
myself up but tying myself with my

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,489
business I feel a bit awkward making

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,890
that connection and making my business

00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:41,519
more personal okay so you mean to say

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,589
that how you can leverage your personal

00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:47,160
branding and bring that into your

00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:49,200
business right yes okay about it okay so

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,180
what I did was I built that authority

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,069
that is the reason the first step is to

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,779
pick your niche you have to build your

00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,729
authority in that if you are good at

00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:58,559
hosting just talk about hosting if

00:38:56,729 --> 00:39:00,329
you're good at designing talk about

00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,509
designing and help the people and give

00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:05,940
back to the community right now when

00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:08,249
people come across like for example host

00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,319
my blog they want to go back and check

00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:12,239
who is the person behind it so if you go

00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,369
on post my blog Twitter account I still

00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,950
make sure that the general tweets are by

00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,900
at the red Rajendra's array so these

00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,789
people want to go back and check okay

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,859
this man is legit here 4,000 plus

00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:26,219
followers and he kind of helped people

00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:28,559
like that so by leveraging that what I

00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:32,299
mean to say is do couple of personal

00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,890
post and are tied using your brand okay

00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:36,900
secondly all the niche that you are

00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,190
following through your brand because you

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,410
know the follow and follow procedure

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,450
that we do on social media right try to

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,400
help them out like what I used to do is

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,009
I used to help some of the bloggers from

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,920
my official profile that is host my blog

00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,890
and also with my own profile

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,930
I was the the thing is that you have to

00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,819
keep showing yourself you know through

00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,940
your brand and through yourself as well

00:39:55,819 --> 00:40:01,999
and then the traffic will jump you know

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,009
so what I did was simple initially I was

00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:06,349
just posting posting posting posting but

00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:08,450
eventually I realized I have to engage

00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,759
and talk to my audience and that is how

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,950
that one post has worked for me so if

00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:15,769
you are creating such an engaging

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,059
questioning kind of propose just RT that

00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:19,930
with your personal thing because your

00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:23,529
personal branding is already strong yeah

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,529
any more questions

00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:37,440
now Thank You Raj I without any

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,860
disrespect I really relate to you a

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,160
Slumdog Millionaire I feel that you've

00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,230
had a personal journey and during that

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,720
you've awoken to understanding how to

00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,610
connect with people how to share your

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,700
information and your technology and

00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:58,740
giving back to the community as a prime

00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:02,220
mover to your success I'm curious where

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:05,220
you're going next I am already on my

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,780
next move with Ron cloud it's a SAS

00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,900
business we are the server management

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,230
panel and with that giving back to the

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,869
community attitude what I figured out is

00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,970
back in 2003 when WordPress came into

00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:20,040
picture it was easy for everyone to just

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,050
care of and build their websites why

00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,320
because there was some kind of a CMS

00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:28,260
there the same culture I am trying to

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,970
bring into the cloud service because as

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:35,160
the CMS is getting more and more feature

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,290
oriented and feature stuff we need more

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,030
performance and what we are stuck with

00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,890
this we have a wordpress and we have the

00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,140
shared hosting why are we not looking

00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,970
into the cloud hosting part because we

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,560
are not the system admin so with run

00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,200
cloud we have built this server

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,970
management panel which is now making a

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,130
complete unmanaged server a complete

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,770
no-brainer so we have created kind of a

00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,359
CMS for your cloud service now so the

00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,550
next move so when I say that

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,350
multi-million dollar host my blog is not

00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,730
a multi-million dollar company when I

00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,790
refer to the multi-million dollar

00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:08,400
company then it's a run cloud and you

00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,810
know we get to we have also competed at

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,910
Silicon Valley and stuff like that so I

00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:15,180
think that's a next to the next move so

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:17,250
I am already there but host my blog you

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,650
can still go on my Twitter you can talk

00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:22,440
to all my customers it's still on 100%

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,790
customer satisfaction ratio so I don't I

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,869
don't leave my roots that is where I

00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,869
started thank you anyway

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,270
now hi Raj I mean I since I'm in the

00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,690
near vicinity of the microphone I

00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:39,490
thought I'd ask you you already pointed

00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:43,800
out the social media platforms that work

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:46,060
for you I mean primarily Twitter yes

00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,800
that's what I was gonna ask you so at

00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,630
the moment you say Facebook works really

00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:55,089
well for you any other platforms what

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:57,670
about LinkedIn Facebook is working for

00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:59,589
me definitely for the bloggers Pinterest

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,720
is working but how Facebook is working

00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:04,750
for me I'll tell you I joined the

00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,640
community so when I go on Facebook if

00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,920
you go on my Facebook you'll realize

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,940
there are certain public post which are

00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,830
meant to probably somewhere sharing my

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,420
my journey what am i doing and stuff

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,160
like that like you know he asked like

00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,690
what's next so a lot of people who

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,180
follow me they want to know what's next

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,580
and all that what next is the public

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,700
post that I do but most of my time I

00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,800
spend on the various groups replying to

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,480
various questions and helping them out

00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,570
with the suggestions and recommendation

00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,130
I still do it so even if tomorrow with

00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,440
your blessings if I become a billionaire

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,660
I will still do that because it gave me

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,670
a reason you know because I was homeless

00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,859
and then I started doing this so

00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,180
probably until I'm alive I'll keep

00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:50,020
giving back to the community

00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:52,330
right so Facebook is a great stuff go

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,270
join the relevant groups come I will

00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:58,270
accept your request don't worry but join

00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,070
the groups and learn from it you know so

00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:02,410
that is where the branding starts I'll

00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:05,710
tell you there are the plugins they just

00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,630
came in and they are more than hundred

00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,540
thousand dollars without marketing just

00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:16,210
by being within the community yeah thank

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:17,950
you thanks welcome more questions this

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,530
side is all silent is like we don't

00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:25,690
understand what is talking this side is

00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:28,520
super powerful did I confuse you guys

00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:34,460
then ask questions or the game is over

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,210

00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,310

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,860
okay I hope right now my thing I will do

00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:42,140
that later but the last bit that I

00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,350
wanted to do is just give a quick live

00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,610
demo on spinning the servers like Walter

00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,510
vulture I don't know what you call that

00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:52,790
but vulture and how you can just set

00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,620
that unmanaged cloud or in just few

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,420
clicks but not a problem I'll do the

00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:00,170
