00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,859
to submit themes this is this is a

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,140
different talk quick background so we're

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,470
talking about creating a lead main lead

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,480
generation machine go easy on me

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,160
this is a fresh presentation haven't

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,020
done this before but let's get going so

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,700
just a little quick inter about me my

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,520
name is Robert I'm one of the solutions

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,320
engineers at WP engine so in terms of my

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,820
background Michaels already gone into WP

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,850
engine but my background I've started

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,980
three startups and exited one I love my

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,020
little dog her name is Chelsea I like

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,050
basketball and go for like a team that

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,590
never wins and I love to making

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,730
WordPress do crazy stuff and break so

00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:02,190
cool and gender of this talk is what is

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,899
about firstly when we're talking about

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,580
creating a lead generating machine we

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
want to understand okay what are we

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,549
talking about when we're creating a lead

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,110
what does a lead mean how does that

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,460
impact your business like what are the

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,390
steps that go towards like that lead

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,280
turning into something that's actually

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,080
valuable so we want to understand the

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,700
funnel first we also want to understand

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,350
okay what are we mean by sort of push

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,150
and pull marketing there's a very basic

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,950
sort of concept of marketing I'm sure a

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,110
lot of you here have more sophisticated

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,930
ways of understanding it but obviously

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,369
this is a beginner sort of talk and then

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,220
we're going to talk about like some

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,509
possible ways of ledge leveraging this

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,880
kind of model so I was in like

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,829
understanding social media and content

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,509
marketing to kind of build on that

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,340
initial outreach and then talking about

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,960
sort of lead generation in nurture so

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,909
things that you can do to kind of turn

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
that person who's found your content

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,360
interesting into someone who's willing

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,670
to actually do business with you and

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,070
then because I love automating

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,990
everything because I'm super lazy

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,079
figuring out how to do that okay awesome

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,180
so I just want to start by saying this

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,799
is good for small business owners or

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,899
traders and freelancers small creative

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,930
agencies and anyone who's looking to do

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,000
sort of growth focused grow our growth

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,319
brokers who are growth focused on the

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,180
business but they're a little bit time

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,590
poor so this is going to be for some

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,209
people pretty simple for

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,510
it may introduce new things hopefully

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,620
get some value out of it so the first

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:26,480
thing I want to talk about is

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:29,489
understanding the funnel now who here

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,720
has kind of created a sales and

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,549
marketing funnel before whoo you guys

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,840
are awesome there's like ten in hands

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:41,910
awesome right so basically it's it's a

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,590
visualization of the customer journey so

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,140
you understand okay how do they first

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,519
interact with your brand okay how do

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,349
they understand it what is the messaging

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,090
behind it and then going through each

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,370
step to get them from becoming like

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,019
let's say understanding a brand to kind

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,519
of being interested in it to purchasing

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,470
whatever it is that you're offering and

00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,970
then to becoming advocates of it so as

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,549
we grow you know and this is especially

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,239
in the case when I started oops

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,129
especially the case when I was doing

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,239
startups and like creating products that

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,120
no one had ever heard of and they're

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,579
like who the hell is this guy I used to

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,019
say run around trying to do sort of

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,879
day-to-day things I was really

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,260
unstructured about the way I was doing

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,180
things I was just trying to generate

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,250
business and hustle which I was like hey

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,530
hustling that's like cool

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,880
but like if you hustle without structure

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,269
you're just expending energy for no

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,099
reason and so without understanding what

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,540
the structure is that you're using when

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,190
you're hustling is really hard to

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,040
iterate on it's really hard to improve

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,389
if you're like okay well how like how

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,769
much time can I shave off running

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,500
between appointments and stuff like that

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,510
that's not that's not useful you know so

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,819
the only really good way to understand

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,290
how to kind of optimize that is by kind

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,720
of mapping out that journey and creating

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,549
a funnel I see a few of you are taking a

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,049
shot of that that's a very basic sort of

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,690
sales and marketing funnel so it's a

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,790
good one to start with but it allows you

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,799
to understand you know like the metrics

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,569
for or understand what sort of metrics

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,430
you need to create for defining when

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,900
someone has become interested you know

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,329
instead of kind of just feeling it out

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,010
or when someone is ready or has signaled

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,389
sort of buying intention instead of kind

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,000
of just going and they view they look

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,410
like they might want to buy and so like

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,060
it gives you like some metrics that you

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,650
can improve on and iterate and growth

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,919
grow your business so the first concept

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,719
I'm going to it's very simple I'm

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,250
assuming most people have heard about

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:28,130
the difference between push and pull

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,100
marketing here

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:34,919
everyone has heard about well you Orson

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,229
Michael that's interesting so so

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,380
push-and-pull marketing is really simple

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,820
it's just about understanding okay where

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,320
is the direction of that message coming

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,190
from are you pushing it to a broad

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,320
spectrum or audience or are you creating

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,090
content which is engaging so that people

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,410
are wanting to actually engage it with

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,100
themselves so pull marketing bring

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,919
people towards it neither is better than

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,810
the other I would say so it's important

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,030
to kind of deploy them at different

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,100
points within the funnel to achieve

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,530
different things so I'm going to pick on

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,880
a couple and hopefully I'm gonna be able

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,600
to provide you some actionable insights

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,260
that you guys can deploy today all right

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,199
first one social media okay awesome so

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,430
social media obviously everyone uses it

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,120
there's a huge amount of eyeballs as of

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:29,970
2019 users spend fifteen percent of

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
their time awake on social media which

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,729
is like when you think about it like

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
instead of thinking about how many

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,690
viewers you get how many visitors or how

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
many users are on that it's a huge

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,050
amount of screen time and a massive

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,370
market to play with and so it's a really

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,650
easy and cheap one to start with and so

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,880
for example one of the things that you

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,229
can it's it's really great about

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,900
developing brand awareness as well it's

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,449
a form of sort of push marketing one of

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,760
the I guess techniques that is

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,080
potentially useful that maybe you guys

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,659
can look at exploiting is called

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,639
ingredient marketing so just to give you

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:05,159
an idea of how that works does everyone

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,440
know Intel yes

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:09,680
no one does anyone not know until you

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
don't know okay so Intel is like a

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,220
basically CPU manufacturer and prior to

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,389
sort of the 1990s they weren't very well

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,520
known out of sort of professional

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,229
circles and the way that they kind of

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,570
built their brand awareness actually

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,740
increase the brand awareness from 24% so

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,789
when they surveyed a group of customers

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,699
to 94% was simply by like adding like a

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,650
sticker to every PC so now it's like

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,970
super it's it's super well-known as you

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,260
can see very few people don't know about

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,210
it and so it's a really effective way to

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,560
market they're always lurking and

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,940
basically over that

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,400
period where they are able to increase

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,040
their brand awareness okay they saw a

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,889
four times increase in revenue and so

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,930
brand awareness really does correlate to

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,480
like the business that you're trying to

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,240
build

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,380
OOP this was this some metrics that

00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,730
hoots should have done just recently I

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,800
believe like just at the start of this

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,270
year so these are super recent the only

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,860
reason why what kind of wanted to point

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,389
this out is it kind of demonstrates you

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,340
kind of the size of each market we're

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,580
working with feel free to take a picture

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,190
it's really useful the key thing now

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,710
with social media as I mentioned it's

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,780
it's really an intrinsic part of the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,310
human digital identity and so unlike

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,620
other platforms which can seem really

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,840
impersonal in the way that it works

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,510
these are intent usually people who are

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,630
using these use it in interns intensely

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,520
personal ways and so oftentimes when

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,860
you're engaging with them on with push

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,310
marketing with kind of presenting sort

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,169
of say a message that's that perhaps

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,250
like might interest them they engage in

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,900
a way that's like a little bit more

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,400
personal than saying coming in a bit

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,479
garden because of the platform that

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,919
they're on and so you'll find that a lot

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,930
of the people on here are typically

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,669
really sticky so that means like things

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,260
like for example content like for

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:56,220
example creating white papers or like

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,140
videos and things like that people

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,419
actually watch it okay because they

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,870
don't have that pre preconceived notion

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,669
that they're basically being sold to I'm

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,490
gonna throw I'm gonna basically focus on

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,520
the largest platform on there which of

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,950
course is Facebook and basically what I

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,410
want to be able to do is after this kind

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,750
of show you three really simple best

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,850
practices that I think everyone should

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,410
be observing when they're using Facebook

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,760
making sure that using them in using

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,680
them in a consistent manner to be able

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,350
to cut like consistently grow their

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
brand awareness on social media so the

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,889
first one and these are specifically

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,510
from Facebook so these are not a secret

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,650
but if you haven't seen them you know

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,659
there are something that you want to

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,039
make sure you're always observing you're

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,440
always thinking about when you're doing

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,080
anything so first one is obviously keep

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,610
posts short and specific you want to be

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,860
really specific about the message you

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,330
want to communicate and the reason why I

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,580
say this is not just because some

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,800
marketing gurus said it we actually did

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,960
a study with I believe us advanced

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,950
genomics is that remark

00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,320
well the Jen's II study what was it

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:04,050
called yes yes the center of something

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,320
generational kinetics and basically what

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:13,320
they found was that Millennials have a

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,170
12-second attention span right which is

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,030
cool you know because Gen Z which is the

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,500
most recent generation as in people who

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,270
are like now attending university and

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,360
stuff who engage with these platforms

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,830
because an 8-second attention span so

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,990
this is a trend that's continually

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,330
decreasing so in terms of attention span

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,280
you only have about eight seconds to

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,520
work with before you lose you know

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,130
they're there they're by in basically so

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,360
it's it's really that's the reason why

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,980
it's really important to keep kind of

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,440
post short and specific pictures are

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,220
really good you want to post frequently

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,590
and timely I think this is really also a

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,940
best practice so obviously with the

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,250
amount of noise generated these days in

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,740
terms of content there is more content

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,660
developed around the world within two

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,620
days now than like your grandparents

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,130
would have consumed in their entire

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,840
lifetime

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,940
so we how do you stick out from that and

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,680
there's no really like one magic bullet

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,210
and this applies to not just social

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,230
media but any sort of form of like

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,160
marketing where you're involved in

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,690
content you want it to be consistent and

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,980
you want to time it correctly for

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,690
maximum impact and you want to keep

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,240
doing it over and over again we

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,150
typically find the best times to post

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,590
are like based around the workday for

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,150
our particular industry it may be

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,710
different for your industry so something

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,660
I always recommend is to understand your

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,250
customer by doing sort of focus testing

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,440
groups asking them the right questions

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,540
about like when do you view like social

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,710
media and stuff like that so we find

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,190
like for example 8 o'clock in the

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,540
morning 4:30 p.m. just before they go

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,620
home because everyone's kind of bit lazy

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,620
they're checked out by that point and

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:50,550
also during lunches is a good time for a

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,170
social media and finally highlight

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,050
engagement customers this is this is

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,160
something that whoops sorry I didn't

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,100
even go through here I was clicking the

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,490
wrong computer I'm sorry about that so

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,530
highlight and engage with customers this

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,910
is one of the unique things about social

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,329
meeting the reason why I brought it up

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,129
most push

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,049
Marketing of course is just broad-based

00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,429
like if you send something through TV

00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,989
it's not like Charlie in their chakra

00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,819
flattery where you can interact with the

00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:17,499
customer afterwards right you kind of

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:19,869
just sit it out there and hope it's like

00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:21,100
a billboard but the thing is with social

00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,689
media marketing of course is when you

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,309
push something out you're able to get a

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:26,079
response and it's really important that

00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,790
when you do get a response put some

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,230
effort into responding back because it's

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,970
actually the most powerful way to

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,399
demonstrate the core message of your

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,759
brand now in terms of like what I mean

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,040
by that is this adds an element of what

00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:42,279
I call social proofing okay it's much

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,709
more powerful to show or demonstrate why

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,360
you are or you do what you do rather

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,920
than just telling people because that's

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,059
what push marketing essentially does but

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,230
it gives you the opportunity to

00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:54,819
demonstrate it okay all right also

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,179
people have a bit of free promotion so

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:00,069
it's always great cool so that kind of

00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:01,660
takes care of social media marketing the

00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,749
next thing I kind of want to go into is

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,790
content marketing so we're talking about

00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,829
sort of blogs and videos I think there's

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,949
a really big misnomer especially like

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,299
with like content marketing and

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,739
WordPress so a lot of people like oh I

00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,999
want to create content and so they start

00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,459
writing as many articles as they can

00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,519
okay but the thing is like we recently

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,410
kind of did a review of Google's search

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,720
policies around you know search engine

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,489
optimization how they rank you know

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,470
websites for you know relevance and

00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:31,419
importance actually turns out that it's

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,149
not necessarily content it's just

00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,589
general domain Authority so when we talk

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,329
about content marketing we should not

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,369
only be talking about the standard

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,230
things like blogs and videos etc but

00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:43,059
also things like for example guest posts

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,860
or guest spots on podcasts or like

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,470
speaking agents like this you know or

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,839
you know like say for example creating

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,160
means even like that that is a that is a

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,429
genuine way of creating like good

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,019
content marketing 78% of consumers trust

00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:58,029
brands that publish their own content

00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,889
okay and if you're just relying on kind

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,329
of written content that becomes really

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:04,179
kind of state so you want to be like

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,009
really varied in the way that you kind

00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:12,069
of develop that need in people okay

00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:15,910
entertaining way all right so and one of

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:18,069
the ways that I like to whenever I write

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,980
sort of content or whenever I create

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:22,510
content is to answer these kind of five

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,730
questions something like an acronym that

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,900
I try and remember for myself and so

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,060
that every time I create a piece of

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,280
content it's always trying to you know

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,650
adhere to each of these and that is I

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,540
call it Tessa but it's targeted it's

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,370
engaging and that means it's content

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,740
that's like not not just polished like

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,840
sometimes raw content is really awesome

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,280
its shareable so it's able to help

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,040
others and help others build their own

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,570
brands and story-driven that's really

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,980
important as well a lot of people forget

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,450
like you do a listicle there's not a

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,370
whole lot of story in that but it's you

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,600
know being story driven builds that

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,220
engagement and finally it's

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,990
authoritative because that's what Google

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,470
looks at do you know what you're talking

00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,270
about

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,650
do other people think you know what

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,980
you're talking about are you a trusted

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,300
source okay so one of the things I kind

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,060
of like like talking about it's kind of

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,370
the cooler like there's a concept called

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,810
the content hacker I kind of read about

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:16,680
this sort of stuff but like basically

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,580
what you want to look for I guess in

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,470
creating content apart from like

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,240
answering and to answer these questions

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,190
first thing I would say is like look for

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,450
a fit okay and that answers the question

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,770
of being targeted so it's like

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,170
understand your customer what do they

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,300
want to see it's very different you know

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,270
to say creating location specific

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,330
content for let's say a our video games

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,310
or something if let's say your target

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,930
market like you suddenly start like

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,970
sending it to I don't know geriatrics

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,220
care kind of facilities it doesn't work

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,840
right so you need to understand that you

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,550
need to think about how this is going to

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,290
grow your business and not just simply

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,010
add to a pile of content that never gets

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:56,320
read thirdly you need to think okay what

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,750
is the current market trend is there an

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,980
opportunity for me to add value is it

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,870
something that you know I can

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,670
demonstrate expertise in and rapidly

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,670
build that authority that Google is

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,500
going to refer back to you also want to

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,900
basically be able to create sustainable

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,190
content a lot of people I find when they

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,930
create content especially if they're not

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,520
following look like a specific content

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,500
strategy is that they're going to create

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,570
really specific pieces of content that

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,940
are time bound and then after that time

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,050
it's like hey I can't use this anymore

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,690
I'm gonna delete it or I'm just gonna

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,580
put it somewhere else right it's really

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,110
important as you grow in scale it gets

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,730
harder and harder to do that over and

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,470
over again so creating like evergreen

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,970
content that you can constantly publish

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,690
is also a really useful exercise to

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,160
understand

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,069
how it's going to affect not just now

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,470
but also like future readers and then

00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:43,360
also brought it up before but like SEO

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,329
minded so for is that so make sure that

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,339
you know you you're able to understand

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,709
you know how Google is understanding

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:57,129
your your content and and format it for

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:58,569
that I think that's about it next thing

00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:01,569
I want to kind of go into is each of

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,069
these steps in terms of targeting now in

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,089
terms of like targeting I've kind of

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,319
talked it's really important to

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,550
understand your audience and stuff like

00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,040
that but what are some tools you can use

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,300
to do that with and so something that

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
you might want to look at and I

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,310
typically use like kind of a startup

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,930
methodology when I come to sort of

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,329
iterating my content that is you

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,430
hypothesize something that you feel that

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,110
your target audience might like you test

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,519
it by writing some articles and see what

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,720
sort of response you get and then to

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,980
iterate but in order to be able to

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,329
iterate and understand what's the

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,220
response you're getting you need these

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,800
kind of tools so one of the things I

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,569
typically recommend is monster insights

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,250
it's a really good analytic solution

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:39,279
just generate you know it just generates

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,810
data from Google Analytics and you're

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,189
able to really easily understand you

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,360
know what is resonating with your

00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:46,420
customer and so you can just do more of

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,100
that okay it adds a dashboard that shows

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,990
sort of where people are coming from to

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,850
consume your content so it gives you a

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,920
good idea of the channels that you're

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,569
using and how effective they are and it

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,550
also comes with a we commerce tracking

00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:58,930
as well so anyone using e-commerce that

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,279
that helps cuz you understand how people

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,290
are kind of moving from there to cart

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:09,760
the other one I kind of just brought up

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:11,740
is a is exact metrics okay so they're a

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,949
little bit more I would say

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,870
comprehensive and that's another one you

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,870
want to kind of check out as an option

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:27,380
oh sorry I talk really fast my apologies

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,310
so the first one is muster insights okay

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,750
they're the ones that make I think it's

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,350
so Google Analytics dashboard for

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,910
WordPress

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,040
but monster insights if you look that up

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,200
you should be able to find it and the

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:45,000
other one is called exact metrics one

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:46,320
word cool right so the other thing I

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,930
kind of want to get into is really brief

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,730
but effectively like there's no point

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,600
creating content if no one reads it

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,760
right

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,020
and I really hate sort of click beta

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,730
content but headings do matter okay it's

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,800
the thing it impacts your SEO

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,330
significantly and so without a great

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,830
title no one's going to read it and so

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,990
your content is kind of pointless this

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,210
title here the reason why I brought it

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,340
out is everyone knows the onion it's

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,040
kind of that yeah yeah see a lot of

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,030
nodding heads this is one of the first

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,630
titles that they created and kind of

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,950
sparked the direction of the entire kind

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,510
of publication and the way that they

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:27,750
approach their content okay so titles

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,070
are really powerful the second thing I

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,120
want to say of course we're talking

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,530
about sharing before you want to

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,170
encourage sharing and engagement from

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,370
your users so for example one of the

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,920
tools you may want to look at

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,880
it's called sassy sassy social share one

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,910
of the other things I would also

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
recommend I come from sort of that like

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,120
I said the engineering background these

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,070
kind of tools they can be a little bit

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,960
heavy on your site so make sure you kind

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,610
of vet it make sure you have a sort of

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,780
performance budget so you understand how

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,310
it's impacting your site's performance

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,260
when you add these and kind of measure

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,900
before and after and then determine is

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,190
this going to be worth while versus sort

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,500
of the performance in fact it's going to

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,600
give so you can see like there's a ton

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,810
of options it supports heaps of social

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,730
media kind of channels it supports that

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,740
social share counting thing that creates

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,710
that element of social proofing and like

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,770
many other kind of social media plugins

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,640
you're able to use third party services

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,990
to retrieve those stats and then also

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,780
like I was talking about story driven

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,040
one of the I guess misnomers about story

00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,690
driven is a lot of times when I talk

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,550
when people when I say story German a

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,590
lot of people think okay I need to paint

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,840
like a narrative

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,909
you know of you know whatever a thing

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,539
I'm doing oftentimes it's simpler than

00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:40,879
that so for example one one kind of

00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:43,340
personal example that I have is when I

00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,200
was in Singapore and I was working in an

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,879
accelerator one of the really really

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,409
effective ways that one of the other

00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:50,990
startup started I was working alongside

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,299
was able to kind of reach their audience

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,039
and really grow exponentially we create

00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,539
like a developer diary so they ended up

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,909
just like creating a diary of their own

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,559
experiences writing it as if they were

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:02,240
just talking to themselves but actually

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,100
sharing it with the world and through

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,210
that it actually created a lot of value

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,740
for other people who in sort of a

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,269
similar situation kind of developing

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,200
products even if they'll just developers

00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,059
they weren't actually working on a

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,490
start-up it actually generated a lot of

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,799
interest in his own his own startup

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,320
himself his own brand and so don't just

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,179
think about like ways you can create

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,499
narratives and just target it to the

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,480
customer think about your own personal

00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,889
narrative think about the way that you

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,820
know you have come to the brand yourself

00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,409
you have come to create your own

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,549
business and illustrate that for the

00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,379
customer as well because that's often

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:35,990
more more interesting than anything else

00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:38,480
you can formulate also one thing longer

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,980
is better developed domain Authority so

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,200
there's a lot of obviously articles out

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,240
there who talk about hey keep to 600

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,820
words or something like that and that

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,519
sort of thing is kind of becoming less

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:53,029
and less valuable as I mentioned earlier

00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,460
content is really exploding to really

00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:57,259
get domain Authority now to Google to

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,960
get Google to really respect what you do

00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,429
you have to really develop expertise in

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,980
a niche and you have to demonstrate it

00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:06,019
you can't simply write 600 word articles

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,659
on like a range of things unless you're

00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,789
like the BuzzFeed okay and so what that

00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,649
means is and I did like some research

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,259
around this neil patel did a study on

00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:19,399
this as well you know he found that for

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:22,070
search related articles the top 10

00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:23,659
articles in sort of I think he did like

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,669
something like 90 different searches or

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,649
something like that the ones that ranked

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:30,320
in the top 10 were typically 2,000 words

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,289
on average okay so the big takeaway is

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,029
that content rich science with really

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,889
really niche domain Authority are the

00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,049
ones that I found most useful by Google

00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:40,970
and typically most useful by the people

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,740
who use it as well okay so make sure you

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,650
put that effort in again you want to

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,810
think about sustainable

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,070
these kind of articles you want to be

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,660
able to reuse them

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,160
it's no use kind of creating a 2,000

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,650
word article that only lasts for a week

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,250
right so there's that consideration you

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,260
have to put into account okay so we get

00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,910
into sort of some of the meat of this so

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,860
next thing I kind of want to talk about

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,420
is a League qualification nurture so

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,390
we've already talked about you know

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,160
building awareness generating interest

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,200
in your brand how do you now get that

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,720
interest into a form where you're able

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,920
to I guess capitalize on it if I mean

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,220
it's a business right you need to make

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,170
money and so one thing to keep in mind

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,810
is of course we're in a digital age so

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,270
customers are more educated than ever

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,310
and so you want to make sure that you're

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,330
not simply just selling whatever service

00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,550
you're creating you want to be

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,020
consultative in the way that you reach

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,580
your customers you want to understand

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,950
what their problems are and you want to

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,540
be able to add ripped like directly talk

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,880
to them okay so I'm going to go through

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,240
a few things that goes into that first

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,800
thing I want to go into is CRMs who uses

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,370
the CRM at the moment with their

00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,140
business

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,860
oh it's less than I expected cool so CRM

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,320
stands for customer relationship

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,110
management kind of takes over kind of

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,760
that role of how can I say your diary

00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,560
you know oftentimes if you're running

00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,790
around is sort of a freelancer or you

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,130
were running around as a small business

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,300
like trying to keep track of all the

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,610
interactions you have with all the

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,750
customers is a mind-boggling affair and

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,980
so you want to be able to offload that

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,270
and that's what CRM is are able to do

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,420
they call client client relationship

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,310
management tools so just a few stats

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,660
just to indicate how important these

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,570
things are and why they're so ubiquitous

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,360
in larger organizations without a CRM

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,040
Paro has found that 79 percent of leads

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:29,100
fail to convert which is a huge amount

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:31,260
okay based on the compounded annual

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,590
growth rate that businesses received

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,970
from implementing a CRM average compound

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,860
annual growth rate is fifteen point one

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,640
percent it's pretty high and for

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,700
implementing a CRM the typical business

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,370
sees a return on investment of $5 per

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,500
dollar invested so it's a pretty high

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:56,400
value activity

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,840
okay all right so let's talk about like

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,070
how you manage these like once you've

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,409
implemented a serum how do you manage

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,820
that okay so the first thing is you you

00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:04,049
let's say we're talking about nurturing

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,470
the lead the first thing you want to

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,450
understand is let's say someone's put in

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,980
contact form inquiry right and you've

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,530
got that through to your inbox you want

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,909
to make sure that you respond to that

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,650
immediately and the reason why I say

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:18,120
this is it's not because like you know

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,580
like that's just the right thing to do

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,320
as I mentioned the market nowadays is

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,700
really saturated so it's likely that

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,789
this person has submitted a contact form

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,640
to you know a number of other businesses

00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:34,080
inside sales has found that you know 35

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,760
to 50 percent of sales that go to 35 to

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,679
55 percent of sales actually go to the

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,049
vendor that responds first so oftentimes

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,600
just being first to respond wins you the

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:45,600
deal which is pretty weird

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,289
HubSpot also found that the longer you

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,120
take to respond to that inquiry the less

00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:54,419
the exponentially less likely you're

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,990
going to get that deal the second thing

00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:00,470
is maintaining constant contact okay and

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,780
so there was a study done by genius calm

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,880
about consistent contact with customers

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,870
and they found that when they surveyed

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,789
buyers buyers indicated that or 66% of

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,470
the buyers indicated that consistent and

00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,000
relevant communication provided by the

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,789
sales and marketing organizations of a

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,409
company were a key influencer in helping

00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:21,570
them decide what sort of solution they

00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:23,280
want to help grow their own business and

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,600
so you want to make sure that you

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,190
capture every lead that you can you make

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,720
sure you like contact them on a regular

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,730
basis they don't fall through the cracks

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,299
because two-thirds of the time that is

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,919
what actually leads to you losing out

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:37,320
third thing as I mentioned you want to

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,700
be consultative too often and this

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,460
especially comes from that transition

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,350
from push marketing to pull marketing we

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,970
just kind of featureless you know if

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,640
someone says hey I have a problem you

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,200
just great I can fix it look at this

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,940
5,000 things to use right but you're not

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,890
really understanding what their problem

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,679
is you haven't you haven't talked them

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,330
you haven't kind of like drilled into it

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,830
and kind of pulled it apart and that

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,289
means like you haven't been able to

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,809
really provide value you know and so you

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:05,580
want to be able to to do that sort of

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,750
obviously in a scalable way and one of

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,490
the

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,410
salable ways of being able to do that is

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,060
kind of using something called sort of

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,220
drip campaigns you want to be able to

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,270
nurture them through let's say email or

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,880
a number of different channels drip

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,200
campaigns have evolved from emails and

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,430
you want to understand like there are

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,900
two questions that I typically like to

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,600
understand it's like what are the

00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,010
challenges are they facing okay and what

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,930
are the questions are they asking about

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,260
the solution instead of trying to go

00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,430
here's some features they're awesome

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,660
this is great because it allows you to

00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,550
set up like when you eventually do

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,690
actually like meet them or have a

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,920
meeting with them or you actually talk

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,270
to them you're able to have a much

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,360
warmer conversation you have some

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:44,270
context okay the last thing I would say

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,070
is of course you want to be able to

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,320
create advocates even if you don't win

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,630
over their business being professional

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,860
being able to conduct your business in a

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,660
way where you're creating value for this

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,280
customer even if they find your product

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,960
is not a fit they will tell other people

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,030
about your product and this is the most

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,510
powerful way of generating business it

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,820
creates a network effect and so even

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:07,730
though let's say you know someone has

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,520
kind of from her from Allegiant or lead

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,260
nurturing perspective one way you can do

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,150
this is instead of simply cutting off

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,440
communication put them into a marketing

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,880
nurture sort of campaign or something

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,250
like that constantly reach out to him

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,050
about sort of new developments sort of

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,550
say events that you're holding or

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,960
whether you'll be in town and stuff even

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,610
if they're not gonna be your custo grab

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,740
a coffee with them you know people love

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,450
that

00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,620
alright this actually goes into CRM next

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:36,490
so I kind of went a little bit past

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:44,720
backwards that's all cool so I will I

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:46,820
will probably skip this one for now okay

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,440
awesome oh cool so this is kind of a

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,940
last step we're getting to the end of

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,500
our time anyway so this is good

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,420
so we're talking about automating it now

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,370
so we've already talked about ok how do

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,350
we generate awareness how do we build

00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,330
that interest and then how do we note

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,340
you that lean let's say you start to get

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,110
busy you start to grow it gets really

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,300
hard to do all of those steps in a way

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,190
you know that's scalable especially if

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,130
you're kind of doing them by hand so

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,500
some of the ways you can kind of win

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,210
this process is by using word press

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,220
because word press is so powerful with

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,510
kind of that native REST API it allows

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,640
you to basically use so many different

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,120
tools that you're able to kind of

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,200
automate a lot of that process so

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,150
basically we've already gone into the

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,320
funnel so don't need to really review in

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:32,210
that okay let's see so some of the

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,910
things that I like to do basically

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,650
there's about as Michael said over

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,600
50,000 plugins that you can kind of

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,190
leverage for WordPress which one of the

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,170
plugins are going to work for you and

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,520
also because there's a REST API as well

00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,900
there's a number of other things that

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,640
you can connect with it that don't need

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,590
to be a plug-in a couple of the tools

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,880
that I like to use just as a preface

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,730
before I get into the actual recipe

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,900
itself that is really simple to leverage

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,690
and don't require a whole lot of

00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:01,820
knowledge and expertise to get working

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:04,910
one skalds a PA okay it's that what can

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,500
I say it's a little like eight-sided

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,400
star with a white circle in the middle

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,780
and also IFTTT or if this then that okay

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,220
and these are like they're not

00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,050
enterprise-grade but you know like

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,100
they're super easy to get going okay I

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,590
recommend you have a look at them

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,410
alright cool this is the cool bit okay

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:24,230
so this is what I like to call a really

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,720
basic automation recipe okay it's

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,850
something that like anyone can get going

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,860
really easily it doesn't rely on any

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,750
sort of tools that require a high level

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,940
of expertise but it does allow you to be

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,490
super effective in the way that you kind

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,230
of not only build awareness create

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,990
interest but also kind of nurture those

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,730
leads and build growth in sales in your

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,730
business so the first thing I would say

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:50,930
is everything kind of hinges on content

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:52,910
okay so we start with WordPress the

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,840
bottom left-hand corner and so when you

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,670
publish that WordPress content may be on

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,890
that WordPress content you want to put

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,570
something like WP forms in there to be

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,490
to be able to capture leads directly on

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,020
the page but also not everyone's going

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,670
to go to that web page right so you need

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,200
to exploit other channels as well so

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,910
something like a tool that I like using

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,380
is called buffer I'm not sure if anyone

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,400
here use it does anyone use buffer at

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,870
the moment four five six people awesome

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,150
the reason why I like using buffer is

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,950
it's super simple to use you don't need

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,650
to worry about creating a big-ass you

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,600
know annual marketing campaign calendar

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,280
or anything like that you just set it on

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,800
an ongoing basis so you can say okay

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,320
every like two times a day publish

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,759
whatever is next on the feed you know

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,080
sort of thing and you want to be able to

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,789
push them through to the particular

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,659
channels or social media channels that

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,309
are applicable to you

00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:41,200
of course Facebook one of the biggest

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:42,399
ones out there Instagram is another one

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,779
that integrates with buffer and of

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,419
course LinkedIn if you're doing anything

00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,899
that's be to be related all right

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:48,730
awesome

00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:50,799
and that basically funnels people back

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:54,159
into the website now once someone has

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,929
submitted their details into the contact

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,870
form using something like SAP Pierre you

00:30:55,929 --> 00:31:00,309
can push it into straight into something

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,100
like MailChimp or if you want to use an

00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:05,379
in Bateen there's actually a tool called

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,750
I believe it's called CRM for WordPress

00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:09,460
that actually converts WordPress install

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,470
into a CRM so it allows you to manage

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,909
everything within WordPress so that can

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,159
be like a separate install that you kind

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:16,950
of push it into and then from MailChimp

00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,899
MailChimp has a huge number of

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,690
integrations itself what I like to do is

00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:24,190
you want to basically they've already

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,500
contour they've already viewed your

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,720
contact on say less what I call invasive

00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,139
channels okay now you want to kind of

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,700
leverage some of them more I guess

00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,559
closer channels to the customer of

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,840
course email is a really simple one

00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,240
MailChimp already handles that but you

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,320
also want to leverage SMS I believe

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,570
there's already been studies done that

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,490
typically about 70% of people when they

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,470
receive an SMS will engage with it it's

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,909
just an innate sort of human thing you

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,100
see that little red dot on your phone

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,960
you want to look at it right and so a

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,610
platform that works really well is

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,049
called Twilio that I recommend everyone

00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,110
check out it actually is

00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:02,440
enterprise-grade a lot of companies use

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,360
that for their own SMS platform okay but

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,519
it's super simple to use so you can

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,899
check that out another one you might

00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,559
want to look at is engage buck which is

00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:13,120
a little bit cheaper another really good

00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,970
quirk that I like using and the

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,980
particular funnels that I use is that

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,440
little tool down there it looks like an

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,500
X in a box

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,570
it's called Xai it's actually a startup

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,330
that developed an artificial

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,429
intelligence scheduling bot okay they're

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,600
based out of San Francisco and what it

00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:36,519
does it actually scans the emails and it

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,529
actually communicates with your custom

00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,690
automatically to schedule time for you

00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:42,610
to be able to give them a call okay so

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,110
you know those times where you spend

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,590
time kind of sending emails going I'm

00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,850
available

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,590
like I'm not available at 4:00 how about

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,480
five I'm not available at five that sort

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,149
of thing that is taken entirely out of

00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,429
your scope and you can actually build it

00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:56,019
that into each step within your drip

00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,549
marketing campaign that allows you to

00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:00,279
push people through the process towards

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,259
sale without you ever being involved and

00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,490
then finally X dot AI basically puts an

00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,320
appointment in your calendar for you to

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,799
be able to talk to the customer and that

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,269
that brings me to the end of that recipe

00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,559
okay so hopefully through this

00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:14,399
presentation you've kind of gotten a

00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,360
base understanding of creating awareness

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,830
building interest in the particular

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,720
brand that you have and then also

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,490
nurturing that lead but then also using

00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,110
those cut that kind of knowledge or

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,090
those kind of tools and putting that

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,980
into an automated recipe so you can kind

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,419
of get really efficient in the way that

00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,889
you engage with people and only deal

00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,960
with sort of the the stuff that's really

00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:34,419
high value so you can really accelerate

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,629
the growth of your business all right

00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:39,540
that brings me to the end of my very

00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:42,000
impromptu presentation

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:45,169
[Applause]

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,140
[Music]

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:56,820
many questions no oh I was hoping no one

00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,380
put the hello hey no no that was really

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,900
good thinking I didn't quite get the

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:09,210
name of the SMS twill yard these fellows

00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:11,190
Twi li oh yeah yeah it's super handy I'm

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,100
gonna ask a massive favor that we get

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,960
some links to those logos I sure can do

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,179
that later this contents all gonna be

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,320
available later it's been filmed so we

00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,320
will get some reference there

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:31,470
good thanks thanks you had a picture

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,990
there of onion

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:37,619
yep newspaper yeah didn't get your drift

00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:40,230
ly with the words that were blanked out

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,520
I knew what they were oh yeah they told

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,679
me that they're naughty so I can't put

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,990
them up will you put it up as a good

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,460
example or bad deed that one that's a

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,720
good example because it allowed you to

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,060
contemplate it and understand it

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,980
sometimes it's not necessarily about the

00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,990
content within the the title it's the

00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,730
fact that you reacted to it so that was

00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,160
a really good I was really good title

00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,020
and I know I am like you I hate

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,050
clickbait titles but the point of that

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,430
is that you hate it so it means you're

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,430
engaging with it yeah

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,310
do you have any specific recommendations

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,770
for wordpress plugins that connect with

00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:30,680
buffer there was a little icon there but

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:33,440
sure I believe they're already use an

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,760
integration between buffer and WordPress

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,760
but I'll double check that off two words

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,980
anyone else goes all right let's call it

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,980
then big round of applause again

00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,900
