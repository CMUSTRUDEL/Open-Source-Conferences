00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,880
here to share my story today I'm here

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,219
purely as a user so how did his

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,120
WordPress fit into my work let's start

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,530
at the beginning my beginning so let me

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,289
go back to the beginning of my WordPress

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,030
adventure it was back in 2010 I loved

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,129
writing and after spending a lot of time

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,379
writing for others I wanted my own space

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,020
my own place to write about the things I

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,489
wanted to write about I was starting to

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,730
see the emergence of blogging and

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,440
bloggers and I must admit I wanted in so

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,719
I decided to start my own blog the

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,420
purple notepad as you'll see through my

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,799
slides I do like purple I did a little

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,400
research to find out what other people

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,750
were doing I tapped into my friends who

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,509
knew a little bit more about this space

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,820
that I did or quite a bit more and then

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,860
I took the plunge with WordPress so I

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,110
started in May 2010 and I kept the blog

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,640
running until about December 2013 so it

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,159
did cover some big moments in my life

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
more of it as I said a personal blog

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,540
about me and what I was doing in my life

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,630
but it was very much learning on the go

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,299
I got to work in my full-time job in

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,270
government communications I come home

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:44,549
gone and I sort of play around here and

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,829
have lots of fun doing it when I look

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,689
back now I can see how basic it is but

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,479
it's all I needed it was a place to put

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,240
my blog post I had a menu I could add

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,579
images I even got to add advertising I

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,619
thought I was making it pretty big and I

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,829
loved every moment it's a space for me

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,750
to learn explore play and do it all on

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,969
my own terms and I could always find

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,069
resources and tips on how to do what I

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,610
needed to do so I'd Google something or

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,840
YouTube I'd watch oh and I'd muddle my

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,510
way through

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,120
so tapping into the collective wordpress

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,519
knowledge available really did help me

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,260
enormous lee and i saw it as a learning

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,870
and development tool I was having fun

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,550
while learning at the same time and

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,030
that's one of the reasons why I've

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,030
always loved WordPress and why I think

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:38,640
it's valued by so many people so fast

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,410
forward a couple of years to 2015 I'm a

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,780
little older a little wiser and I

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,010
decided to start my own strategic

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,200
communications and content writing

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,849
business I needed a professional

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,940
platform for my site and I knew exactly

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,280
what it would be I've evolved so have my

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,680
needs and so has WordPress it has the

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,599
perfect platform for what I need I was

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,579
so excited to get back into WordPress it

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,170
had been a few years I missed being able

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,239
to log in and have a play in my own

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,799
little space and it was a chance for me

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,810
to take my business and my platform to

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:13,160
the next level so when people say why

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,569
WordPress my say well why not WordPress

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,730
it's the leading website platform in the

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,950
world and for good reason powers more

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,290
than a third of the web it's a platform

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,959
for white house golf for Reuters for New

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,600
Yorker so we're in pretty good company

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,250
it's allowed me to use my strengths on a

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,099
platform where I feel comfortable it's

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,959
user friendly it's reliable it's logical

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,209
it's trustworthy and you can get a

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,889
website started in minutes I don't

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,019
consider myself to be technically savvy

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,160
I've said that from the outset but I've

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,370
been working with content management

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,790
systems for a little while and WordPress

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,410
is really up there it's easy I just have

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,700
always loved spending time in the

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,709
backend of my website

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,569
so another testament to its word to

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,370
WordPress is its community as we see

00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,440
here today I'm this is the first time

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,900
I've been to a I'm a WordPress or a word

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,400
camp event and I love it it's fantastic

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,579
I'm really excited to be here to learn

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,139
about to learn more about WordPress to

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,269
see people who are passionate about a

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,790
content management system and the

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,349
difference it makes to giving people

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,109
businesses causes a platform a

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:21,870
foundation a voice a safe and secure

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:24,030
place online so as I said I why I love

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,380
WordPress it's a safe reliable and

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,840
secure web platform

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,460
during my time working in other content

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,650
management systems always did what I

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,880
needed to do and got out probably a

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,590
little bit terrified I'd knock something

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,050
over while I was in the back end and the

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,550
whole website would come crashing down

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,350
it's a totally different experience in

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,970
WordPress for me you're sure I know I

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,500
can't get into trouble with the boss if

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,810
I break the whole thing because I am the

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,180
boss but the back end of my website is a

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,950
place I feel comfortable happy and at

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,040
ease I'm quite happy pottering around

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,020
there and having a go lots of business

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,180
owners bloggers and others who venture

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,300
into the online space want a website

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,780
that offers a great user experience it's

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,410
easy to use is easily navigated looks

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,120
great

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,640
tells a story and does what it's meant

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,120
to do whether that's to inform to engage

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,860
to educate convert or sell most of all

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,200
they want to site in a platform that's

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,870
reliable and trustworthy and WordPress

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,820
delivers that and more it looks and

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,470
behaves professionally as I mentioned

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,270
earlier it's used on a platter it's used

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,310
as a platform by some huge names in the

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,810
online world and once you're on

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,460
WordPress you can choose from an array

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,430
of themes to give you the look and the

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,620
feel that you want it's a basic and

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,690
fundamental question why do you need a

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,870
website whether it's to sell a product

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,360
or share your story to service inform or

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,700
educate whatever it is you're doing you

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,230
are sharing a story your story you're

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,600
connecting with your customer your

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,420
reader your community and that's what

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,190
WordPress allows you to do in an

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,930
environment that's heavily dominated by

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,730
social channels having your own space

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,660
your own place on the Internet is really

00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,670
important

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,350
WordPress gives you that digital

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,420
foundation for your business or your

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,510
blog or whatever it is you're creating a

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,280
website for with WordPress as your

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,740
digital foundation you can build your

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,320
website and your business you can add

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,910

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,280
have the platform to grow as your

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,290
business grows WordPress has enabled me

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,540
to play happily in my own little sandpit

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,400
giving me enough space to explore safely

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,500
without kicking up too much sand and

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,900
making a complete mess of my Sam yet I

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,430
am continually evolving and so is

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,110
WordPress with me

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,280
it offers all that I need as I move

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,310
through the different stages of my

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:50,550
business so I started to sprouts in

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,320
August 2016 and the idea of starting a

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,949
website can be really terrifying for

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,419
many business owners and I was I met I

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,370
obviously played around with WordPress

00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,490
before but this felt a whole lot more

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,410
serious I knew how I wanted my website

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,199
to function how I wanted to look and

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,850
what I wanted it to say I knew that if I

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,590
hide our website develop developer to

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,560
take care of the technical acts aspects

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,389
I could take care of the content I drew

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,520
up how I wanted my website designed to

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,460
look yep with pencil and paper was

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,860
pretty high tech my website isn't

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,949
perfect I think is a creative I'm always

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,500
thinking of ways to improve it ways to

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,690
make a look better function better read

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,360
better but I'm proud of where it is at

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,340
the moment it represents me and it's a

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,840
brilliant tool in my business kit

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,910
it's my little corner of the internet

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,280
where I can inform and reach my

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,500
customers it's a place they can come to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,169
to learn about me and my services a

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,789
place they can read my blogs a place

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,260
newsletters and become a part of my

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,659
community a place they can follow and

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,199
reach out to me on social media it's my

00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:59,940
digital foundation it allows me to be

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,240
part of the digital and online world and

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,949
build my business my website is living

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,530
and breathing content I think most web

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,570
sites are and I've come a long way as a

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,639
business owner and a wordpress user in

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,889
knowledge experience and confidence so

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,510
why WordPress can work for you your

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,510
business doesn't stand still it's

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,099
constantly growing and evolving

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,780
WordPress has the ability to grow and

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,789
evolve with your business and customer

00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,620
needs if nothing wrong we're starting

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:31,590
simple then as you and your business

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,360
grow so too can your website I firmly

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,610
believe every business needs a website

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,800
your potential customers want to learn

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,169
more about you find out about your

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,969
services see what you look like see what

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,560
runs you have on the board they want a

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,870
chance to get to know you and build a

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,880
relationship WordPress gives you a

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,220
cost-effective and simple way to start

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,900
I encourage businesses to invest in a

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,030
web developer a cop

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,800
professional images and branding at a

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,080
minimum but you can start simply with

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,700
WordPress you can keep you can then keep

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,820
coming back to your website to add those

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,350
different elements as you grow I love

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,330
that there are lots of plugins and tools

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,070
I think Tony sent this some people use

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,170
too many but I think if you find the

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,350
right amount of plugins and tools then

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,850
the you can make that balance work but

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,370
before you go in adding all of those

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,750
tools make sure that you're adding ones

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,450
that are going to be beneficial and

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,860
helpful to customers and help you

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,770
deliver the service that you want to

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,170
deliver so as Tony talked a little bit

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,890
about before Yost the search engine

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,240
optimization tool in WordPress I always

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,870
recommend working with a professional

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,760
SEO copywriter I'm one of those but

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,080
using Neos is a big help in checking

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,930
your content especially as you move

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,850
forward with your content strategy the

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,800
open source environment of WordPress is

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,450
one of the reasons such an amazing

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,340
communities filled with experts

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,960
knowledge and valuable resources and why

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,400
it exists online and in person here

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,200
today WordPress has been my website

00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,910
buddy as I've navigated my way through

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,760
the online and digital world it's

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,000
enabled me to tap into the community and

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,770
their resources I just want to touch on

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,330
learning opportunity I think sometimes

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,970
when we fiddle around in the backend we

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,460
don't see it as a valuable time or yeah

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,110
valuable time spent but I really see it

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,960
as an important learning opportunity and

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,690
I think I encourage people to build it

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,640
into their learning and development as

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,100
part of their business so set aside time

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,440
set aside a budget invest in us a course

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,800
or something to start that journey with

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,040
you and I've got something I've built

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,170
into my business that time to learn

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,610
about how WordPress is working and how I

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,840
can make it work for me don't view it as

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,490
wasted time because you're still

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,650
learning and finally my wordpress tips

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,840
don't be afraid to tinker as I said I

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,190
love that no matter what I want to do or

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,420
tinker with on my site that there's

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,030
someone out there who's probably already

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,910
done it so if I google it or YouTube or

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,170
tap into the WordPress resources I can

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,860
find someone who's done it and usually

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,570
find a step-by-step way through it

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,400
but if I butt off at this times I've

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,200
realized when I'm out of my depth and

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,690
it's time to get a professional in so

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,390
know your limits know when you've hit

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,010
that that time when you've spent eight

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,290
hours doing something that would take a

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,560
professional one so know the value of

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:25,410
your own time and invest in that and

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,360
find a wordpress developer I'm looking

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,910
for one I had a chat to Tony but some

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,560
yeah I'm looking for one who can help me

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,960
with some of the technical challenges I

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,360
come across back up your website

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,370
regularly I think Tony said weekly I'm

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,400
up to monthly I've got to get better at

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,960
that at least I know if I'm playing or

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,300
tinkering around in the backend then it

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,890
all goes wrong I've got the backup of my

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,880
website to restore it because that's one

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,830
of my worst fears losing my website

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,690
trust the platform WordPress has an

00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,480
incredible reputation as we see here

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,860
today trust it know when you sign up to

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,350
a wordpress site you're getting a

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,440
fantastic product with service resources

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,780
and community as well as I said a few

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,250
minutes ago consider WordPress as part

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,250
of your learning and development if

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,620
you're in business build it into your

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,540
plans invest in you and your skills your

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,480
website is a huge part of your business

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,600
so make sure that you invest accordingly

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,600
and finally I'm going to say add a blog

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,730
I promise it's easy I really enjoy the

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,100
process of crafting a blog adding the

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,710
content to my site playing around in the

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,080
backend with the template adding images

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,810
videos and getting it just how I like it

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,730
that's really easy once you know how I

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,530
could outsource the uploading of my blog

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,960
to my virtual assistant but like I said

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,370
I really do enjoy that process blogs are

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,680
an important part of the content

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,940
marketing strategy but a lot of business

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,670
owners are put off by the thought of

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,800
writing and maintaining a blog don't be

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,630
and have you considered outsourcing and

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,180
writing of your blogs I can help with

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,100
your content creation thank you for

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,420
joining me this morning I really hope

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,340
that whether you're at the start of your

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,230
WordPress adventure or well on your way

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,480
you've been able to take something away

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,700
from today's presentation and if anyone

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,460
has any questions I've got a few minutes

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,230
to do that okay we've got some questions

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,180
now to make it easier because we are

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,600
live streaming if you'd like to pop down

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,600
for us

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,600
thank you hi thanks for your

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,250
presentation given that you're a service

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,470
based business in terms of your lead

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,940
generation how much time would you put

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,860
into your website versus social media I

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,959
think it's really important to have

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,420
valuable content on your website so I

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,830
invest time in in writing a regular vlog

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,350
I now write one monthly and then I so I

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,779
draft that I play around with the ideas

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,020
I put that on my website and then I use

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,200
that as one of the I guess the main bits

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,610
of content that I will put on my social

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,160
but then I've also now because I've got

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,000
quite a library of blogs I've gone back

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,890
to pull out all my yet to pull out

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,640
it's like one-liners that I can turn

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,980
into quotes or other images that I can

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,630
use across social media so you've

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,000
invested all that time in building up a

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,740
library of content and that yes it could

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,050
be blogs or it could be other pages on

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,470
your website so don't think that they're

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,600
just done and dusted go back and invest

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,880
the time in pulling valuable bits of

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,680
information out little gems that you can

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,790
then share because a lot of that content

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,600
I guess depending on what your business

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,000
is but all of that content is timeless

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,950
so yeah I kind of put the focus into

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,110
developing that main bit of content but

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,300
then I've never got that library I'm

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,880
going back and tapping into it and using

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,020
that across my social so I'm not stuck

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,709
to the content because there's nothing

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:52,570
worse than you what am I going to post

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:54,520
yeah one more question

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,890
we can have one more question before the

00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:02,829
caffeine hit kicked in any more

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:05,079
questions for Cody okay well I'd like

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,939
you to please join me in thanking Katie

00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,999
for sharing her journey

00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,999
