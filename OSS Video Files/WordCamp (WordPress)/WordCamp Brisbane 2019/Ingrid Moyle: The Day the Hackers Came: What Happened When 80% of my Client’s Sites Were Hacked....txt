00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,980
okay it was the 19th of March this year

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,070
and it was only a few days until a

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,480
launch of a major membership site that

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,570
I've been working on for what seemed to

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
be forever for a not-for-profit now that

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,920
project was one of those projects that

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,600
it wasn't so much as a scope creep as a

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,090
scope gallop with the hounds of hell

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,390
after it I was really looking forward to

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:39,059
launch when the first email pinged in my

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:41,940
inbox ping uptime robot okay commercial

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,250

art and that site that's a for those of

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,350
you don't know uptime robot is a really

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,719
cool free tool and it you can set it to

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,879
ping your site periodically just to tell

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,190
you whether the site's up or down so

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,550
uptime robot sent to the first alert for

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,020

uptime robot side to back down uptime

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,680
robots lights back up up down it felt

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,200
like in 1970 is aerobics class uptime

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,299
robot up down up Joe it was actually

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,950
getting worse it was like an

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,870
all-you-can-eat curry night at the local

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,660
pub and the toilet seat was going up and

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,220
down and I heard loud okay this is a bit

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,750
of a worry

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,910
so I've dropped an email to all of the

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,799
clients were in the uptime robot alerts

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,239
just letting you know guys we have a bit

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,130
of instability at the moment with your

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,669
site's it's all good I got it under

00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,260
control

00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,239
I'll be chasing it for you see I've

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,760
learnt over the years that it's always

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,500
better to be the bearer of bad news than

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,109
to be at the receiving end of a client

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,480
yelling at you I also sent a note to

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,560
never to be named hosting dear never to

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,269
be named hosting have a bit of

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,130
instability on that web server for we

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,410
were talking about before anything I

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,489
should know about

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,859
nothing up jack

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,690
popped him I left it for the night

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,960
finally 9 o'clock at night I just gave

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,550
up and went back to bed that was it and

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,639
I thought ok I'll have a look at it in

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,880
the morning morning came and all the

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,470
sights appeared to be stable put the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,590
air-conditioning site into the browser

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,750
site was up to thumbs up I thought I can

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,180
finally deal with it's not for profit

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,069
yet again expansion of their project

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,449
while I was trying to find words it

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,520
didn't have swear words and then well as

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,960
I was responding but you get the idea so

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,910
I spent the day just dealing with that

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
not for profit site I thought tomorrow

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,199
tomorrow is going to be the day I'll

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,220
have a look at all of those sites next

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:04,889

some problem

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,949
can you just reset the password on the

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,199
commercial air conditioning site and

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,530
have a look in the front end because we

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,090

ok cool I can do this login to the

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,419
commercial air conditioning site having

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,270
a look don't recognize any of those

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,789
usernames let's have a look at wordfence

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,020
weird fence

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:59,280
absolutely nothing everything's clean as

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:04,080
a whistle the only lockout was me ok

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,120
that's interesting but it's clean hmm ok

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,550
I'll just log into place can have a look

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,860
at this back-end logging into place

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,780
having a look at the files I have no one

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,130
to what I'm looking for it's just

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,009
pretend I know what I'm doing

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:21,870
let's have a look at the files let's see

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,460
if there's anything stands out ok it's a

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,100
file I don't normally install on

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:30,360
commercial air conditioning HTML

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,860
yeah I think that might mean that they

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,170
had three thumbs up I spotted it oh dear

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,800
if the commercial air conditioning sites

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:44,490
been hacked what about the other sites

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:50,160
that are on that server breathe breathe

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:53,360
logging in HTML logging in HTML body

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,979
caching not actually

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,440
excuse my language but that's what the

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:05,210
files were called every single site on

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,099
web 4 had been hacked that was 80% of my

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,370
clients from the last five years four on

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:17,180
that server and every single one of them

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:19,430
had been hacked I can do this I can do

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,810
this and then know that it's been hacked

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,909
I'll go and check into word fence I'll

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,220
do a deep scan because every one of them

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:30,530
had the paid version of word fence let's

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:32,330

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,879
something cuz that'll fix it deep scan

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,889
deep scan okay they're not picking up

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,240
anything there's nothing in Google

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,270
search console everything says it's

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,930

is it's going to cost you five hundred

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:19,970
and seventy dollars plus GST per site

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:25,460
per restore let's go back to there that

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:27,380
was me drinking a lot more but oh my god

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,380
five hundred and seventy dollars plus

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,400
GST plus restore for all of my clients

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,920
for the last five years right

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:42,560
would any other web designer do besides

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:47,120
a lot of swearing Google what did you

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,770
when your WordPress website is hat so

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,190
what I did was started off with a quick

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,770
repair much like a boarding up a broken

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,330
window I started with a commercial air

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,910
conditioning site and I deleted all of

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,470
the users the word man and I set up a

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,210
new user makes I didn't trust anybody

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,290
and deleted everybody

00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,970
I changed the passwords into hosting I

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,620
changed the salt keys and the WP config

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,190
file just to log out everybody who

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,830
wasn't there

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,580
I changed the WordPress database the

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,160
passwords

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,610
I ran high sensitivity scans on

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,560
wordfence everything was still clean

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:25,250
five minutes later I was locked out

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:29,589
again user names were changed one more

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,589
time they had a backdoor into the site

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:40,400
okay determined to jump ahead so then

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,360
what I do i then said okay okay I can

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,270
deal with this I can deal with this

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,830
let's start with triage I went through

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,480
and created a list of every single

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,880
client that I'd sent to never to be

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,980
named Hosting over the last five years I

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,190
looked at who are on maintenance plans

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,170
with

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,330
me and who weren't on maintenance plans

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,330
I looked at my contracts with each of

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:02,930
them to see what I'd actually said as to

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,940
who would pay for hack repairs why had

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,010
great contracts they're a little bit

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,230
gray so I actually rang my lawyer as

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,970
well and said hey let's have a chat

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,160
about these contracts what does it

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,080
actually say I also rang my professional

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,640
indemnity insurance to try and see what

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,470
they would say just saying hey we might

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
have a problem

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,550
checked everybody's contact details and

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,840
I check to see which of my clients were

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,420
going to be affected by the mandatory

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,760
disclosure of data requirements or data

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,990
breaches if you're a web designer a web

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,550
developer and you've got a number of

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,190
clients you need to know that you need

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,990
to know who has what you have to do in

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,630
case there is a breach under the

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,270
mandatory reporting a data mandatory

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,180
disclosure of data requirements luckily

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,190
nobody on that server was caught up by

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,960
the reporting if it was another server

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,060
we would have been in a whole world more

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:55,790
of pain okay I had my triage I knew who

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,130
was affected and I knew what we had to

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,960
do things when I was talking to the

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,350
lawyer though they said um here's a

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,960
heads-up Ingrid you recommended never to

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,610
be named Hosting to your clients you

00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,870
said hey when we build a site we build

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,820
with never to be known hosting and you

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,140
set them up yes the thing was in the

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,970
clients name they took out the

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,210
individual accounts but you only

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,510
recommended one person guess what you

00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,070
are partially liable so all web

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,990
designers have a wee chat to your

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,990
lawyers and check if you only name one

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,170
host similar to me and there's a duty

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,580
great hack you may also be liable

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,740
something to have a think about so I

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,480
decided that what I was going to do was

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,540
where the cost of all of the hack

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,580
remediations for every one of my clients

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,800
the only costs I would pass on was any

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,110
new hosting costs and if there's a

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,030
specialist that was beyond the scope of

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,490
our agency so what can you do if you are

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,850
hacked some hosts are lovely and they

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,930
have they include hack repair like insta

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,270
maybe between and hosting wasn't like

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,670
that you can go to somewhere like

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,670
securing wordfence site lock and they'll

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,810
do a site a clean for you

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,930
works really well if you've got a couple

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,550
of sites numbers really start to add up

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,820
when you've got five years worth of

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:20,050
hosting you can hire a specialist hack

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:22,630
repairer what I did is as I'm in a web

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,790
Support Agency web group a really good

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,220
group called blogaid and blogaid the

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,380
webmaster group is probably my ultimate

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,550
support network they don't just teach

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,020
you how to do web design that's

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,140
somewhere else this is more about the

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,540
techo stuff and if you're new into into

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,760
web design blogaid webmaster group is a

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,320
really useful once I've logged a thing

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,890
onto the Facebook group and said hey

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,380
help

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,230
I need emotional support calm me down

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,880
talk me out of a tree and if anybody got

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,540
any references for a really good hacker

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,460
mediation specialists I also hired an

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,990
external security auditor put out a call

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,400
for an external auditor just to do a

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,460
double check once we've got everything

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,680
sorted I put together some

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,600
recommendation so I rang each one of my

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,900
clients and I said you've got three

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,470
choices you can either pay the

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,870
blood-money to never to be named hosting

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:16,560
you can either get secured wordfence or

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,010
site lock to do it here's the costs or

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,690
we've got a hack remediation specialist

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,320
and what did they choose I'll tell you

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:29,860
that in a minute so what can you learn

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,310
from this so far websites get hacked

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,280
it's a fact of life at any given time

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,850
about 1% of all web sites have malware

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,270
it's 18 point 6 million roughly websites

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:46,000
at any given time have malware in it

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:49,630
even the tiniest tiniest website the

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,570
smallest little one gets on average 62

00:14:49,630 --> 00:15:00,580
hack attempts a day per day but what

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,350
about WordPress well 34 percent of all

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,800
web sites are driven by WordPress are

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,330
powered by WordPress and about 60

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,830
percent of all content management sites

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,730
use WordPress so does that mean

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:14,759
WordPress is bad no

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,689
WordPress is bloody wonderful the

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,100
trouble is hackers go where the money is

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:22,199
so if you think about pickpockets if

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,549
there's only me and Bill and Bill's a

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,230
pickpocket and we're both staring at

00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,939
each other he's not going to pick my

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,160
pocket

00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:32,220
but if there's a crowd that's where the

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,509
pickpockets go all the pickpockets and

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,049
all the hackers are doing the following

00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:37,649
where the crowd goes so if you use

00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,149
WordPress

00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,779
you're just a crowd you're just in the

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,859
crowd and they're trying to get you so

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,480
what are some of the signs that your

00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:49,259
site has been hacked we'll just cover

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,239
that one first number one if your site

00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,669
is hacked in and they do a little jihadi

00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:54,899
thing or suddenly there's people not

00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:58,079
wearing very much and they're very

00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,220
athletic and very noisy about it your

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,439
client is going to be the one who's

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,160
going to spot it first and they will

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:07,499
ring you always guaranteed particularly

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,079
the client you've spent ages willing you

00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,399
might get a particularly red shade from

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,419
your browser from Chrome or Firefox

00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,220
might tell you hey malicious site ahead

00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,629
your hosts might pull your site down if

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,149
they're nice I'll give you warning if

00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:23,119
they're not nice they'll take your site

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,929
down faster than a kid who sees a puddle

00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:29,399
when they're trying to remove their

00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:31,829
clothes Google might flag that it's a

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,069
deceptive site in searches you might not

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:36,209
be able to log in similar to what we had

00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:38,699
Google search console might give you a

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,939
flag security might your plug-in might

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,679
have an alert like your word fence group

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,819
unknown admins will appear just take it

00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,589
as one of your things to check in

00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:49,769
periodically to see who's the admin on

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,989
your site random new files and pop-ups

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,199
suddenly appear might suddenly find that

00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:57,689
your site is now advertising a viagra

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,899
and other little benefits your site

00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:02,519
might take ages to load when the hackers

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,989
get in they just shove so much stuff in

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,309
that your site might take forever to

00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,470
load so when we're talking about speedy

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,149
sites might be this is actually

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,699
contributing to it your site might be

00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:13,529
unstable like we experienced your site

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,269
might suddenly take up being a penpal

00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:17,309
for each and four million of its friends

00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:20,789
around the world if it starts sending

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,079
email you got a problem you might find

00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,149
that you've got extra pages and blog

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,689
posts appearing and you might fund

00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:26,370
sudden

00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:29,669
find that you're strangely popular in

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,289
places like Bulgaria Brazil get over

00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,460
your ego it's not you it's probably that

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:37,970
you've been hacked from somewhere along

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:40,139
those sites so when I rang my clients

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,360
the number one for question they said

00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:46,529
was but why me I'm only your tiny little

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,399
trainee why me the reasons that sites

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,610
get hacked

00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,899
number one is usually political motives

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,210
we're finding that there's a lot of

00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:56,309
political based hacking and they're

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,080
trying to spread their message to raise

00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:01,980
awareness they're trying to bring your

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,330
site into for example the DDoS bot so

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,059
they could scripting you into their

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,740
cyber army that's the most number that's

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:11,159
the number one reason that sites get

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,500
hacked these days quite often another

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,230
reason is that they they want to steal

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,259
identity and use your the identity of

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,639
things in the backend for money so

00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,629
yesterday there was some speakers that

00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,950
were talking about things that you could

00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,929
do on WordPress that you didn't know

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,509
more details that you've got in the back

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,129
the more potential that you are for

00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:31,409
creating a lot of little honeypot for

00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:33,450
people to steal identity they might want

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,860
to skim credit card details if you've

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,769
got an e-commerce site and they're

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,389
trying to do it for money theft of

00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,370
personal info we talked a little bit

00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:43,620
about that that's particularly important

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:47,850
if you've got a medical type site theft

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,919
of personal info is a very common reason

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,450
for hacking and just so you know that

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,610
your personal details are worth four

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,350
dollars fifty on the black market so

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,850
don't think that you're actually worth a

00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,200
lot of money four dollars fifty and your

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,110
details can be bought by the lowest

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,730
bidder hobby Oh lulz has the odd person

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,600
who still lives in their small little

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:10,320
bedroom not that many these days to leak

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,240
information the Panama papers was one of

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,299
the biggest lakes in the world eleven

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,500
and a half million pay of pages were

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:22,169
leaked from the Panamanian law firm it

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,710
was hacked by an unpatched revolution

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,240
slider

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:29,220
according to wordfence you find that the

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,830
armed people are trying to steal

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,809
information and they're trying to get

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:38,350
messages out that's a common reason the

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,179
expose people in governments

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,980
cryptocurrency mining has dropped down

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,929
in the last 12 months we're seeing a lot

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,940
less of that in the past they used to

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,110
just harness your website to try and

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,370
access or to mine their cryptocurrency

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,950
to redirect to their porn sites is

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,230
another reason an SEO spam to try and

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,539
rank this so it's higher injecting their

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,070
all of their links back from your site

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,019
so there are some of the reasons that

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,409
you get hacked it's got nothing to do

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:08,049
with you it's got to do with your

00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:10,779
clients it's got to do with your systems

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,179
and it's got to do with what you can do

00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:18,070
for the hackers you're just the person

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:22,289
in the middle so let's have a chat about

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:25,149
well how do you secure your website okay

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,240

couple more and if you like most small

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,010
business people you've had a try of a

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,990
couple of plugins and you haven't really

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:43,170
used them for a while can you add

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:48,390
another five can we have Hello Dolly

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:50,500
it hasn't been deleted feeling secure I

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,670
kept it didn't your web designer added

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,540
another couple that they didn't tell you

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,760
about they're just testing things yeah

00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,700
this is your average website these are

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,520
the keys to your front door you trust

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,030
that every key is going to somewhere

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,010
safe the problem is I forgot to tell you

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,490
you know one of those plugins that that

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,840
web designer tried and just left yeah

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,570
what happened is the web designer went

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,700
back and got a Jo B and left their

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:22,480
plug-in in the repository and they

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,850
abandoned it which is fine except that

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,800
this lovely Russian man went to them and

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,400
said I'm going to buy your plug-in other

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,520
directions

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,930
I'm gonna buy your plug-in and I promise

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,760
not to add any malware or spyware to it

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,710
and so the web designer sold their

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,810
plugin to this person from with a lovely

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,500
Russian accent and

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:48,580
particular plugin is now full of spyware

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,320
and it's in your website what I'm trying

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,420
to say thank you bill you can you can

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,910
add yeah go on up every theme and every

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,030
plugin that you have on your site is a

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:03,730
key to your front door

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:06,520
so the basic rules if you're not using

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,340
it delete it if it's removed from the

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,200
repository delete it and if it's

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,120
something that's been abandoned delete

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,040
it

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:20,290
each kit you need to know who's got the

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:23,470
keys to your front door okay next thing

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:30,280
to secure your house who knows what

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:33,220
these are it's move it's a little kids

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,810
diary if you're a mum you've probably

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,190
seen these you give these to your

00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:40,930
children Niki's and your child fills it

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,400
full of important information like which

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:47,170
of their friends farts and which teacher

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,970
do they like not like your username is

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,730
another key to your front door and

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,010
unfortunately a lot of people's keep

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:59,380
usernames and passwords as secure as

00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:03,070
this a website in with WordPress the

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,170
default username is admin if you have

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,800
admin and the name of your website or

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:11,140
one of the top 100 hatch passwords in

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,570
the world if you have password as your

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,900
password it'll take exactly zero seconds

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,120
for the hackers to get in if you have

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,800
admin and you decide to be really strong

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,140
and you've got the first name of your

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,600
child and their date of birth it takes

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:29,410
thirty point eight seconds feeling such

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,350
strong and secure admin is as secure as

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:35,710
this little tiny padlock and this little

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:39,100
tiny key first thing you do is get rid

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,560
of all admin usernames get rid of

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,010
manager get rid of tests get rid of the

00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,890
name of your website as a username

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,540
because that will increase the security

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,420
all of my clients had really complex

00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,220
usernames and passwords they all had 16

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,480
character passwords

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,490
that were month had four factors of

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,860
complexity they had upper and lower case

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,710
they had numbers they had symbols a lot

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:10,059
of them had dual factor and it wasn't

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:12,399
enough okay few other things to do make

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,019
sure that things are updated according a

00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,789
site like thirty six point seven percent

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,090
of haxed websites were running out of

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:21,340
date versions of WordPress sixty-one

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,720
percent of hacked web sites were running

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,570
out of date versions of themes and

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,059
plugins according to WordPress wordfence

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,789
all of my client stuff was updated I go

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:32,830
in twice a week and manually update

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,440
everything I check used to be something

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,740
if you do once a month not anymore

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,419
I go in twice a week and check update

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,460
and watch every single thing that we

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,860
update to check to see that things are

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,840
working and arm breaking and it wasn't

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:51,250
enough back to this one just another

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,980
thing while we're shutting the windows

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,750
and shutting the doors and take the

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,659
little boxes at the very top to turn off

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,820
pingbacks and Trackbacks these are

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,529
primarily used in denial of service

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,450
attacks quite often on your site they

00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,460
can just built the heck out of your site

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,409
just a little tiny thing just under

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,120
ticket your ego doesn't need to have

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:12,159
that stroke anymore you might have a few

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,379
years ago these days you don't

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,970
so just untick it and it just helps to

00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:19,000
increase your security it's just another

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,899
window to shut make sure you've got

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,100
quality hosting do your research and

00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:26,019
what I'm saying research don't go to

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,159
Facebook and say hey tell me a good host

00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,600
because all you're going to do is get

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,570
every single affiliate link under the

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,879
Sun do you research ask other web

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,830
designers go outside and talk to all of

00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:38,200
the sponsors you can't go wrong with

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,659
most of us what's is outside when you're

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,740
looking for a host look for 24/7 support

00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,620
because if they're going to hack it's

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,509
always at the stupid o'clock and spread

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,389
your risk we've talked about that never

00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,429
just recommend one hosting company for

00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:53,799
me now I would never ever ever go for a

00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:56,200
small hosting company for me I will

00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,960
always go from multiple large companies

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,059
and I always recommend minimum of two

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,610
for my clients and let them make the

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,860
choice from here on in it's called

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,780
spreading your risk never doing that

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,000
again

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,350
and let your child your clients choose

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,370
they've got to be the ones that make the

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:19,440
final decision let's talk about PHP

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:22,140
another door to shut one of the things

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,570
that runs powers WordPress is the PHP

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,400
runs on your site

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,960
unfortunately 74 point seven percent of

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,390
all WordPress sites are either running

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,040
unsupported versions of PHP unsupported

00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,900
means no security patches or 7.1 now 7.1

00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,180
reaches end of use for life first to

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,120
December this year so if you haven't

00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,950
done it update to 7.2 buggy as it is or

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,400
7.3 and is hope like hell it your

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,900
plugins work but PHP is something that

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,020
you've got to look at it's more secure

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:56,490
and it's faster all of my clients were

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,800
running 7.2 just as an aside another

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,300
thing to shut your WordPress table

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,920
prefix this is something when you're

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,080
installing WordPress for the first time

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,120
for your clients just get rid of the WP

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,100
table prefix call it anything else all

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,440
you're trying to do is to break a common

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,240
attack vector it's a little tiny thing

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,000
takes two seconds on your doing the

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,560
install makes life easier some good

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,200
security plugins will change that for

00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,150
you if it's done post install and there

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,310
are other plugins on the available in

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,550
the market that will help you do it just

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:29,070
all you're doing is shutting doors gets

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,900
back to this one SSL's aren't just for

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,460
your clients your secured your SSL

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,460
certificate they're also for you when

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,600
you're logging into your admin an SSL

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,130
all you're doing when you're logging

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,930
into your admin is sticking your hand

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,130
over an ATM and hiding the number that

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,990
you're keying in and that's all that's

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,570
doing but it still gives you that little

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:50,520
tiny bit of security all of my clients

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:52,260
had SSL's installed backup backup backup

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,930
backup backup backup case you haven't

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,850
heard this backup and as I said I use

00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,040
updraftplus I use the paid version of

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,960
updraft plus and as you can see there's

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,790
a little red column that says delete

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,470
that's what the heck is they did they

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,150
just went down that little column hit

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:10,770
delete delete delete delete delete them

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,420
for all my backups were gone up drive

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,840
class has got some really funky things

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,740
if you go to the advanced tool section

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,530
there's a section where you can actually

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,810
password protect it I didn't do that

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,550
before

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:26,930
so if you go to updraftplus and if you

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,140
use it as a tool make sure you lock down

00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,000
updraftplus

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,400
put in a plug-in or put in that your

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,140
password and lock it down so hackers get

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,850
to it they get to see that screen in

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,260
future also with your backups back them

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,150
up somewhere that even if they are

00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,250
deleted because it's easy enough to get

00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,750
around passwords we all know that go

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,540
somewhere that you can get your stuff

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,670
back I used to back up to updraftplus

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,770
but don't anymore

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:56,790
now I back up Dropbox or Google Drive

00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,360
purely because if someone deletes it I

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,980
can always get it back now it has its

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,190
limits but that's just one of the things

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,930
that I can do and do not rely on your

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,290
hosting as the only source of your

00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:13,230
backups a true example recently this

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,730
year they had ransomware fantastic all

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,130
of their sites got hit by ransomware

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,160
everybody got done and all the backups

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,870
got hit by ransomware from a - so all of

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,260
the people who didn't who were aligned

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:29,340
on their hosts to get the backup got

00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,290
nothing you need to have hosting backups

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,840
and your own ones that you have control

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:40,710
over and make sure that you have the

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:42,330
capacity to get them back again ok all

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,960
we were doing the first stage was

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:48,390
shutting the doors and the windows next

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,650
thing we have to do is that a security

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,150
alarm because the first one all we were

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,910
doing is stopping the drive-by he was

00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,380
flicking the door next thing you've got

00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,050
to do is add a security alarm to your

00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,780
website now I'm gonna feel a lot more

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,260
comfortable if we have Bill wearing our

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,090
security alarm I don't know about you

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,930
but every every burglar alarm we have to

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:12,030
have a nice safe we're feeling safer now

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,400
we've all got our burglar alarm stand up

00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,190
and show everybody how amazing you look

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:21,150
every website needs a burglar alarm

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:22,530
thank you all the burglar alarm does the

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,290
stand at the front door and says you can

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,280
come in you can you cannot come in it

00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,020
goes through the house is looking

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,210
fabulous goes through the house and

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,000
looks to see if things are broken that's

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,240
a security plug-in now there's lots of

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,760
free and paid

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,040
out there wordfence I think security

00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,220
all-in-one security secur I secure lock

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,390
all of those do something similar

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,280
they're going to look at the people

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:48,040
coming in and they're going to monitor

00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:52,480
to see what was what's happening to your

00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,110
site now with my stuff I had paid

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,510
wordfence

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,510
on everything the first thing I install

00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:02,410
on every site one of my clients

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:04,059
I love word fence but now things that I

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,580
had fixed on word fence I had things

00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,320
like hide my WP version I disabled the

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,240
code execution in the uploads directory

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,160
I had an alert that if anybody from

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,929
admin from a different location logged

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,090
in didn't tell me anything

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,230
I had an alert set that was going to

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,610
tell me if there's a large increase in

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,559
attacks nothing

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,450
I have immediate lock out if there's a

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,990
wrong username or password for two

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:28,750
months nothing I have it locked down so

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:31,720
that anybody who's tries to log in other

00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,630
than Australia can't log in the page

00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,429
doesn't show nothing I have tight rules

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,080
for bots they're either blocked or

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:42,400
delayed I have country blocking I have

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,020
dual factor for a lot of my client it's

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,950
got triggered not one thing got

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:50,590
triggered from my paid version of what

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,210
wordfence in any security alarm can lull

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,940
you into a false sense of security

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,720
I will still to this day and stall them

00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:08,020
on everything but if a hacker can get

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:10,570
and burrow through it's no good okay we

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,109
need to add a wall so you've got your

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,429
security alarm in fabulous security law

00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:18,159
the next thing that we need to do to add

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,270
security is to add a wall so I'm I was

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,580
going to say can we have a chance to

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,780
build that wall please I know we're in

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:28,419
the wrong country but you know you've

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:32,020
got to have a wall we've got a wall /

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:34,240
bill could have out our wall feeling

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,840
safer absolutely but it's no good unless

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,720
you actually have some some sort of some

00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,490
border security guards why security

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,900
domes from the International Spy Museum

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,609
so we'll add them to the collection

00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,720
[Laughter]

00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:52,179
beautiful so we've now got a lovely

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,919
security alarm we've got our fence and

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:57,190
we've got our border security guns a

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,080
wall or web application fire will help

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,990
stop the bad guys before they even get

00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,520
to your house

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,500
they're like the guy in the airport who

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,480
scans your luggage before even gets near

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,730
the plane he says hey mate

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,020
can't come any closer which is what

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,090
these security guys are doing and

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,160
they're just stopping the people from

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,780
getting close to your place now if you

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,030
use CloudFlare most people use to put

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,460
the free version of CloudFlare that's

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,869
just a CDN content distribution network

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,570
it's great to stop you from denial of

00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:28,750
service if you want a wall you've got to

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,850
pay for CloudFlare pro 20 bucks us a

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,450
month and it puts in that little wall

00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,160
for you you can also have secured a

00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,369
that's another thing that has the wall

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,609
added to it adds another layer of

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:46,390
security now be honest none of my

00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:48,280
clients had walls and even now I can't

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,950
sell a wall to my clients because

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,040
they're tiny traders 20 bucks us a month

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,490
is a big sell for them I have it on my

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,600
sites but my clients it's a hard sell

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:03,580
just something to be aware of that you

00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:05,770
can add a wall you can also add in

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,810
access security so if you think about

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,700
buildings if you go into the Brisbane

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,170
CBD and I'm not going to read these out

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,690
because it'll bore you to tears if you

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,700
go into the CBD and you go to a building

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,530
you get a look given an Access Pass that

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,720
you'd be pure self in two different

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,350
places and that lets you go to some

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,730
places and not travel to other floors

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,070
you'll be able to get this slide when we

00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,560
do the downloads these are all things

00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:32,680
that you can add to your WP config for

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:36,400
your HT access files like every rule

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,320
with text stuff know how to do a backup

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
of your HT access before you fiddle and

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,490
know how to put it back when something

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,100
breaks because guaranteed at least one

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,320
of these will break your site it's just

00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,210
all it's doing is saying dear potential

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,130
hackers you can go here but you can't go

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,770
over here you cannot touch these bits

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,840
you can't go wandering now some plugins

00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,880
security plugins will do these for you

00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,050
so you don't have to think of code other

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,210
ones won't

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,100
it's just being really aware of what is

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,640
actually in your code and what you're

00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:08,980
doing and just know that some of these

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,810
will break if you use if they send that

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,760
will say Pia some of these will stop

00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,369
those from working so you need to know

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,200
just try one thing at a time and just

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:20,980
test your sight constantly to see what's

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,130
going to work so you got your wall and

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,560
that will increase security on your site

00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:31,420
look go back there and it still wasn't

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,260
enough I had the basic security I had

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,150
paid wordfence

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:38,050
and I had some of the access controls

00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,820
and it still wasn't enough doesn't

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:44,610
matter what you do if the hackers have a

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:47,050
backdoor they go to hack into your site

00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,030
potentially could have been the virtual

00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,619
server and then we talked about that it

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,680
was running a really ancient version of

00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,190
MySQL when I did a clean install after

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,840
the hack

00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,060
we've got this alert so you can get to

00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,490
see how old it was that even turned off

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,930
the order update we want that to be set

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,260
to true you never want it set to false

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,700
you always want it to be set to true so

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,680
you went with websites you're only as

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,570
safe as your neighbors if you've got

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,050
good neighbors you're safe if you've got

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:16,660
a dodgy one not so good

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,970
increases the risk of being hacked so

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,369
potentially it's the neighbors

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:24,130
potentially it was shitty hosting we

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:27,720
don't really know to this day how the

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:31,350
hackers kept getting in the point is

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,359
it's what you do about it that matters

00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:37,300
and the whole thing is it's all about

00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,010
recovery so the worst that happens it's

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,080
all about how you recover from the

00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,270
disaster your clients don't give us

00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,690
stuff who caused it they just want it

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,580
fixed so for me remember I talked about

00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,010
my clients and I gave them three options

00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,350
Blood Money secure AOL wordfence

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,420
scan or to have an external person to do

00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,920
an order to him in a migration they all

00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,030
chose the third one that none of them

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,100
wanted to be with never to be named

00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,320
hosting again and it took a couple of

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:09,280
weeks to get everybody cleaned and

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:12,549
migrated but hacks have costs so I had

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,579
one client who was a small small

00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:19,569
repair service guard he lost 50% in

00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:21,400
sales for that month alone we had two

00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:23,799
tiny tiny clients who that was

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,809
emotionally enough so I actually closed

00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:27,579
the doors to their business that was the

00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:31,359
last straw for them that has shut the

00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:33,279
doors and left for my side of things I

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,779
didn't lose a single client even the

00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:38,410
ones who actually closed their business

00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:39,880
we still go for coffee now it's mainly

00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,049
because I think I was the emotional

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,380
support for all of them

00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:46,660
I rang every minute I rang every night

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,849
to tell them hey we got a problem let's

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,289
fix it I was there because when

00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,759
someone's hacked they feel like they've

00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,420
been burgled it's the same emotional

00:39:51,759 --> 00:40:00,160
drama and so I supported them through it

00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:02,079
so the thing you've got to remember with

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,929
WordPress security you're trying to

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,179
secure we're trying to stop you're

00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:09,339
trying to scream and hence our screen

00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:12,249
and then you've got to help them recover

00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:14,709
at the end because that's what really

00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:19,569
matters as a wordpress security or web

00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:22,269
developer okay all I can say is thank

00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:24,459
you and I hope that none of you go

00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,829
through what I went through but it was a

00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:30,579
good lesson and I'm conscious of timing

00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:33,969
so I don't know whether we'll have time

00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:36,910
for any questions we have any questions

00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:46,479
one question maybe we can do one quick

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:53,170
quick quick question yes a question up

00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:55,479
there yep yep so as you mentioned a

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:58,420
while ago like most of like clients

00:40:55,479 --> 00:41:00,729
especially those of a start-up they

00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,199
cannot afford like monthly subscriptions

00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:05,529
and all that stuff for their security

00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:06,999
right so um oh although some websites

00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:10,719
say for example they're just like a

00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:13,239
brochure type websites like what is your

00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,420
recommended what I call this like

00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:18,069
plugins or the minimal things that we

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,479
could install as a security for the

00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:20,650
websites that a minimum would be all of

00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,029
those things that I said to start with

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,309
the free ones like keys

00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:25,670
I still have wordfence paid that's a

00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,470
non-negotiable and

00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,410
site that I do I build that into the

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,299
cost builder and then the main things I

00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,030
do the access control I do all of the

00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:36,500
access control things cuz they're free

00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,089
but they're my there might absolutely be

00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,619
a minimum and then back up

00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:43,400
I always keep back up some backups and

00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:44,869
backups now yeah how about to say thank

00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,990
you to Bill for being our wonderful

00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:53,330
security support thank you and please

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:58,219
give a big THANK YOU to Ingrid as well

00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,219
