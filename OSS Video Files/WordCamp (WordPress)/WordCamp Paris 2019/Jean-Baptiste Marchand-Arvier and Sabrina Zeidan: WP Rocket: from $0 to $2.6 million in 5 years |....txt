00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,450
so it's five years since the rocket hit

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:42,540
the market right yep and last year

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:45,450
you've done 2.6 yeah for wqo cats yes

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,710
yeah that's a great number for the

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:54,360
plugin so what how did you do that

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,910
actually yeah lots of working yes now

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,280
the first thing I would I would say is

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,739
just to give a bit of history because of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,390
course you're not wise to that numbers

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,060
and who's actually look like like that

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,450
and we did work with a huge team and a

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,030
great team and also without a huge

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,670
market because so wqr get to the cash

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,220
include me and everyone need to have a

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,470
faster websites you know well it is your

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,930
bit of traffic and so people are really

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,060
looking to improve their website exact

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,400
options exactly free and really good

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,840
options the thing is we are providing

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,670
something a bit different because we

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,500
choose since the beginning a premium

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,259
model because we want to afford an

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,689
excellent quality of service I'm into

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,720
products plug-in but also providing an

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,180
excellent support because since you're

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,070
caching plug-in you know you change

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,229
everything on the website so and there

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,320
might be conflict it might be issue and

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,509
when the customer is using it and he has

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,439
an issue he won't be happy so our job is

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,479
to make him happy

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,280
even if he has an issue so basically

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,979
it's to solve this issue and for that we

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,810
need to have great support and that's

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,220
something I really believe that we have

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:11,250
so that helps help has a lot of having a

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,710
lot of new customers but this portfolio

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,920
just support for the war okay but for

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,800
all cost all issues customers hell

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,390
exactly yeah since so since a caching

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,840
plug-in is in the front of the website

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,490
every single through the website so it

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,890
can be difficult for the support as well

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,440
because every time a customer is having

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,690
an issue he can think this is because of

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,700
WP rocket because since he installed the

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,280
work you bucket something has changed on

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,709
this website so the contact us so we

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,110
have a lot of tickets which is not

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,150
directly related to WP rocket but we

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,170
have to to solve the solution also

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,500
follow the boundaries of this support I

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,780
mean you can go over world far away from

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,709
exotics like these yeah exactly and

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,290
especially on supports you know so we

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:04,680
really need to have a strict limit on

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,100
the supports to I mean as soon as it

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,320
goes outside of WP rocket and it's not

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,300
related to WP rocket we are very clear

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,150
with our customers saying that okay this

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,670
is not related to WP rocket we don't

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,130
help you however we are always providing

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,670
several solution we can say we it's not

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,549
our fault

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,610
just go away so we we don't solve

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,140
directly the solution but we give them

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,519
something for them in order to have a

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:37,049
solution for them yet yeah a book has

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,650
about I think five hundred thousand

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:44,130
visitors yeah so this is a big work to

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,980
do this is to like lower the support

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,070
tickets to educate customers yeah oh

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,680
this is equation channel it's a little

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,549
it's multiple after I mean it's really

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,190
both this is a this is something we

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,590
really haven't lately Stu will focus on

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,100
concept marketing and this as elpizo

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,049
much on having a much more new customers

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,959
much more new with new because we have

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,600
invested a lot on creating content and

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,519
creating great content so of course it's

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,479
is for SEO this is for adding new

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,970
visitors which will maybe become new

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,480
keister

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,570
w-wha conductor so we have a lot of

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,100
content which is to educate them about

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,650
performance because performance in you

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,170
is something very complicated yeah it

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,840
can be yeah it's difficult its technical

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,030
and there are lot of things were people

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,610
sings they know which is not necessarily

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,740
true so we need to educate them a lot

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,470
about ok should I use a CDN what is

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,330
unification what is Bubba cache

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,360
I heard that I should the neighbor

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,490
objects but what is j0 issue so there's

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,320
so many things that you can you can

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,170
Aven sometimes it's really complicated

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,660
especially with the tools which gives

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,610
you performance feedback like page be

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,030
like GT metrics because it's really

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,720
global so they will say okay you don't

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,760
have jay-z

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,440
compression label but if you look at the

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,450
details your website arches of

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,520
compression unable but it's only because

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:17,110
you are for example body in Google

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,440
Analytics with jay-z and a customer will

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:36,970
see okay but I have an able W to Rakatan

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:40,229
I don't have that and because it's about

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,720
support but the word P walk out of it

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,669
yeah so we have a 10 people on the

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,970
supporting it's always worrying because

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,250
recently we have huge groups on WQ

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,440
bucket so we are worrying about our

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,690
support team right now at the time we

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,050
are talking we are hiring sweet new

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,680
people for coming on the tip on this

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,870
report so it's going to be bigger we

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,300
have two developers working on the

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,910
bucket we are also hiring new developers

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,160
as well we have two people working on

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,710
the product we have one people working

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,750
really specifically on the marketing one

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,240
on the applications and one on the

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,120
content so as you might see there are a

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,400
lot of people and a lot of people

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,260
working on different things like

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,740
marketing like development like support

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,090
so it's really

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,660
different kind of people and that's

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,040
really interesting because it's Queens

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,410
something different and very unique

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,410
which comes into the world people how do

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,780
you like collect people right people for

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,270
you how do you know hi people how do I

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,890
know the people's right good question

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:51,320
it's really complicated I mean hiring is

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,910
one of the thing which is one of the

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,530
most important especially for my job

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,410
because you are creating a team and you

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,760
need to have really the best team player

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,970
to do great product in to have a great

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,880
company we have invested a lot into

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,880
hiring I mean changing our hiring

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,130
process investing a lot of time because

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:18,560
at the beginning we were totally

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:21,100
inexperienced first yeah yeah mostly

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,840
developers and even if we love

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,360
entrepreneurships it was media our first

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,100
song experience and we recreate it just

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,650
you know we're just a few people and

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,660
then we're teaming up 20 people in like

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,790
three four years so we do need to learn

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,680
in a very fast way and there's so many

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,890
things to learn because the product is

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,290
management however development so many

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,780
things and at the beginning we were

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,900
mostly focusing on hiring people based

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:51,760
on feeling which works and we have been

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:56,780
able to quit waking thanks to that but

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,720
now we didn't really hire twenty we hire

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,090
people with you especially on the

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,650
beginning and it's basically from people

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,030
of the WordPress community because

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,700
that's a great community and that's

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,740
great so we should find what you always

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,060
have the model is the same mindset the

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,970
same vision and so that's we get but we

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,510
were a bit more focused on hiring based

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,060
on feelings and not based on what did

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,430
they do how they really work because

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,470
that's really what matters at Vienna of

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,690
course I should have the same focus the

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,910
same vision as you so we have recently

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,370
changed where you were hiring so we have

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,790
completely been waiting that we whiten

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,720
the our all process which is now a set

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,159
of three interviews with

00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,560
of different people and this is

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,470
everything is written and that's really

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,720
working well and we are really focused

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,210
on the past on the people who are hiring

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,580
but they how did they do on their

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,130
previous job how did they react on

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,440
specific situation because you know

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,660
usually we were asking okay if you have

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,300
this situation how would you react and

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,120
they were giving a great answer but the

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,170
to see if you never explained their

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,450
situations

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,790
yeah exactly now we are really focused

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,610
on the situation which has existed for

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,860
these communities on the institution how

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,070
did you react and which is much more

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,290
better than asking how would you react

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:27,840
because of course I will give a perfect

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:29,730
cubicle in fact how do how did you do

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,880
when it really happened them with that

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,390
it helped us a lot on finding the good

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,790
candidates and the thing is we are

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,680
totally remote so it dealt so much I'm

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,600
quitting waiting because you are not

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,180
limited geographically you know you can

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,000
hire great people from you guys from

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,530
Canada from Colombia from Spain from so

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,780
many countries I mean all the countries

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,880
and that's really great and that's great

00:09:51,780 --> 00:10:02,010
a unique achievement that I would love

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:05,580
it a channel of learning mostly I would

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:08,460
say experience because I mean you know

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,990
you are directly into it and most of the

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,670
time you don't necessarily have time to

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,610
okay to read books and to see how it's

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,040
working you're just you're confronted to

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,020
the new thing so ok let's do it and of

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,300
course you will fail and we have failed

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,430
so many times but you are learning and

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,670
this is yeah I would say this is how we

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,920
learn by failing you know and I think

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,800
Janette and me my my co-founder we are

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,900
quite lucky to have some good guts you

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,510
know some good most of the time we have

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,750
good feelings which seems to be good and

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,210
that helps us a lot of having good

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,280
solution of course we fail but by

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,720
speaking about fails what were they like

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,060
the wrong decisions you remember so many

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:55,410
bugs like name the few the most

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:58,470
the I think there is a something quite

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,390
common in the entrepreneur is we are

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,210
strongly positive and we have the

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,660
tendency of forget what was bad so I

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,390
will give you so many answers I remember

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,200
a few technical things but what I would

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:17,030
say the biggest the biggest mistake we

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,380
did was to try to do too many things

00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,620
because at the beginning so we created

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,200
the work you market and then we created

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,870
a mattifying will have been in a way

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,670
successful in both languages okay and

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,100
that seems quite easy to create

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,680
successful products that would be great

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,860
if we could do so many other products so

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,560
let's try a security plug-in and also we

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,350
hire people to create themes for seams

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,660
and you know we were too many distracted

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,650
you we try to do too many things and at

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,930
the end we lose what we know but with it

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,270
was performance and that what we know

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,340
what we are willing with that so like

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,430
one years ago or two years ago we really

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,220
decided to focus on what we are good

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,060
which is performance and so we stay on

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,420
performance and we do Orkut modify our

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,700
image optimization service and in the

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,670
next some other product but which will

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,250
be very focused on performance and to

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,440
not do so many things and you know when

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,280
you have even if you only one product

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,240
you can do so many things to put it

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:29,970
supports the marketing side but like

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,330
transparent roadmap like we did have

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,340
issues everything is like open yeah this

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,100
is rarely you will get the ideas how to

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:43,500
develop WP rocket from customers from

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,960
from yes yeah so we can talk a bit more

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,720
about transparency yeah yeah interesting

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,410
because the company has everything open

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,930
like numbers salaries like everything

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,770
yeah not many companies do that yeah

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,710
that's unfortunate to give you a bit

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,820
more context about why we did that so we

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,610
have been very lucky to learn

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,720
back on the learning thanks to all our

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,980
companions which was sharing things like

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,940
buffer like all the friends I knew like

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,430
their matrix they were sharing

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,970
everything and like the way they were

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,490
hiring and we took that with oh that's

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,030
great we are learning and let's it seems

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,950
to work let's do the same at the

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,710
beginning it was not transparent and at

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,500
the point we say okay we have been about

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,290
to to gain so many value because of

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,480
companies who have shared things let's

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,760
do the same I mean we have we have

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,100
learned so many things and that could be

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:51,160
winning yeah there is no reason to

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,860
icings I believe that if more people

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,820
will be transparent that would help so

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,530
many things and and it's important to be

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,410
transparent for a good reason

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:05,710
and our reason is based on the more

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:09,610
information you have and not like yes as

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:11,160
everything so it just it would be to

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,380
take the good decision because usually

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,360
bad decisions comes because you don't

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,630
have enough information so we share the

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,260
more information in order to people to

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,990
take the green decision and so it helps

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,510
us internally but externally especially

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,430
on support for example when people were

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,010
saying yeah you are doing something bad

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,690
and we shall we say okay look we are

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,210
sharing everything so if you want to

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,340
hook up to to share your negative

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,990
feedback on WP okay please do look

00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,870
everyone is doing and we are sharing

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,660
everything so we really don't have issue

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,600
with that and I believe this is

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,120
something very strong because with you

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,370
know more source of networks more

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,170
disability now that a lot of customers

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,330
when they don't have what they want say

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,700
we say hey if you don't give me that I

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,280
will publish on Twitter or Facebook that

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,990
you are bad company and that everything

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,990
is bad and it's really

00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,699
and give the privates and make

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,029
everything not to go this out

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:18,579
I've so many so and our our vision is

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,970
that and it works most of the time is

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,459
okay dude please do it please share we

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,860
would be very happy to see what you say

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,420
and to answer objectively sinks for

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,329
sharing everything and most of the time

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,370
it's really really effective because

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,019
they don't expect that most of the time

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,529
when you say that to companies they

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,110
execute because they are afraid of bad

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:43,389
of that of that content and we are not

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,670
because I mean when every everything is

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,880
sure there is no noise about that yeah

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:53,010
so this was one of the right decisions

00:15:48,880 --> 00:16:03,880
yeah exactly yeah there are a lot of

00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:08,110
yeah three-three like crucial points

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:14,920
like the turning points I think it was

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:18,220
March 2014 the end of 2016 and end of

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:26,500
2018 what happened then how how the

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:28,930
graphics go like with some projects so

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:33,010
to go back to the through the beginning

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:35,019
of the word p1 we started in France as

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,110
you can see with my strong accent I'm

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,910
French and when we when we launched a

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,519
vertically rocket we really wanted to

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:49,569
launch it on in France because we knew

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:53,649
that our product was more perfect as a

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:57,120
local company not necessary we we we

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,800
knew that you guys beat orbit outlet a

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,579
international market would be more would

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,439
wait more from attaching plugin like

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,449
even more features and we at the

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,730
beginning we didn't have any big

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,850
features just dashing basically an

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,860
unification and so we wanted some more

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,429
important to try

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,140
it was to be the fastest it was really

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:24,189
easier for us to just have a French

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,720
website French communication French

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,120
support so we say okay let's do

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,950
everything in France and and it was with

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,630
a side project at the beginning so we

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,340
didn't want to invest so many things

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,640
would we say we say ok let's find

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,039
friends yeah so it was and at the

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,230
beginning and the review was ok we were

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,049
doing like 5000 per month which was

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:47,440
really wonderful first we were the first

00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:51,010
surprise but it was the concept yeah

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,350
yeah no no no so it was it was great but

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:58,360
it was really flat and at a point we say

00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:01,269
ok we see it's it's get some we've new

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,809
but if we want to to be full-time on it

00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:06,610
we need more because with 5000 we do in

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,460
two company you don't pay you a lot of

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,519
things and we don't pay salary so we say

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,110
ok let's let's go international now we

00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,730
have improve our product we have

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,460
collected so much feedback from our

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,210
users let's translate our website and

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,450
let's communicate outside the world and

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:29,320
that's what we did and slowly slowly it

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:32,019
became more and more famous and that's

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,269
where the community as well exactly

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:37,240
that's where the growing comes from

00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:41,470
because we we started also 12 feedback

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,529
from the big websites like W Qatar and

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,480
the white of the test and that brings us

00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,340
a lot of new customers and since our

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,010
products were great and our support for

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,419
great it was like nobody noticed of us

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,429
you have to know we commendation you

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:56,500
haven't it's thing bigger so this is

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:59,200
supposed to be the first pitch and the

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,330
first huge growth but simply because we

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,139
translated our website and we really

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:09,120
communicate so of course it was a really

00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:12,519
good product it was translation yes yeah

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,409
what next so we on the on the on the

00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,440
beginning we focused so much on the

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:19,360
product yeah product and supports

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,950
because it was within the core of what

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,990
we wanted to do and we were willing yes

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,799
but we suggesting which is marketing how

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,350
much more so our growth at the beginning

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,429
and since like one year ago was focused

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,090
on just recommendations reports but also

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,000
contacting like

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:43,090
quest relationship you know PR we were

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
contacting so many bloggers to simply

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,710
say hey this is we are WP wocket we do

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,779
that if you want to try I can provide

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,870
your license and if you like it that we

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:56,350
would be so happy 12 blog post and this

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:59,080
works so well but at the point and this

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,779
was last year in the last two years we

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,419
were at the top on there with you we saw

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,270
that we were doing two hundred thousand

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:10,899
dollars per month but it was not growing

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:14,409
that much and so we really decided since

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:15,970
our product was better and I mean

00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:22,330
everything was well organized to be

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:25,000
invest into marketing so it was but not

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,309
we were like we need focused on product

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,279
and the marketing was minority and we

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:33,100
really focused on our existing customers

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,020
to have could we tension to a lot of we

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,970
knew all grades and create the best

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,370
product and the thing is we were not

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,500
expert at all on marketing so we were

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,710
doing ourselves but not necessarily so

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:49,690
we really decided to to invest into it

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,679
so we hired a few profiles like someone

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,320
to manage I will have a program someone

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,090
to manage all our marketing and also

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,700
someone to avoid the content and

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,070
starting to that of course after few

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,139
months because you know the time people

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,269
come to your company and and start

00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,309
working and a few months after that we

00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:13,450
have seen so many great result about

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:15,389
that with you so what part of the

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,669
revenue

00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:24,370
marketing costs what part of revenue

00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:26,260
they take right now it's it's

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,659
complicated I mean that's something we

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,789
don't really calculate a want to

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:34,870
calculate even it's always difficult to

00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:38,970
I mean you can equate the returns

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:42,790
yeah I mean you you can know how many

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,250
specific action bring you in terms of

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,980
renew like AdWords like Facebook ads but

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,950
I mean although the marketing investment

00:21:47,980 --> 00:22:02,500
is really complicated to measure and

00:21:49,950 --> 00:22:05,670
attend to which action ok so what are

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,070
the channels mainly yeah

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:11,950
jabya program is is really big and she's

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:15,220
bringing a lot of new customers I was

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:19,900
contacted by a few years ago asking if

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:27,660
you guys have a first program but at the

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,660
time we want to Alvin what persuade you

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:35,050
we I mean we at the beginning people

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,630
were providing feedback and were

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,760
promoting WP rocket for free yeah

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,640
because the product was excellent II

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,990
still examined it but we really wanted

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,360
to help these people to promote it the

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,330
Buriti market more and to have new

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,840
people who were able to promote WP

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,670
rocket so that's why we decided to have

00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,490
this program and this world very well

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,370
and sometimes I don't like personally

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:06,730
affiliate program because people are

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,230
recommending things not because it's a

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,410
good product but just because they are

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,970
going to earn money but since I strongly

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,680
believe that the Bernabeu rocket is a

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,680
great product which else to customers

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,750
and all our customers most of our key

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,000
stores are really happy about that so

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,740
many great feedback another I mean it's

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,480
really good to have an affiliate program

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,280
to things so people who are recommending

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,440
it's just not a good reason to write

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,540
like a book post instead of short tweet

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,520
you can tweet like oh what a bleep rope

00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,560
it's you make my website faster three

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,290
times but if you Internet program there

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,450
is a good

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:48,350
so like create a blog post to make

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,300
screenshots to wait yeah yeah and to

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,580
have you know partnerships all the

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,260
plugins with the hosting attempt so much

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,320
to have an affiliate program because you

00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,570
have something to to give to them so

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,240
actually a program a lot of course a lot

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,830
of SEO we are writing a huge amount of

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:10,040
content on the blog this puts the mostly

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:14,390
on WP rocket blog plus on our website we

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:18,860
create new content we do AdWords with

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:23,060
you experimenting Facebook ads and of

00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,770
course all our customers space because

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,480
we are providing them a great product

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,110
and great support and they are

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,180
recommending us so basically what WP

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,600
media is selling it's not product itself

00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,960
right it's support exactly what we when

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,000
especially with WP rocket which is GPL

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,370
what we are selling is simply to support

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,830
any update product is free and it's on

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:52,970
our it's only publicly on in terms you

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:55,730
can directly download Pewaukee right

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,330
exactly and of course since we we have

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:02,690
external services like a critical path

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,190
CSS generator we need to be linked to

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,380
the website so we are selling there so

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,600
that all those service related market

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm speaking about pricing models it was

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,210
fun to begin that w broke it will be

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,310
premium dragon no freemium model no free

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,220
version at all it was from beginning

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:22,520
yeah from the beginning

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:25,010
so first reason was to to know that we

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,310
didn't wanted to do free a free plugin

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,580
yeah why because we wanted really to put

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,980
something to to create something wait

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,800
and to do that we need time and for that

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,000
we need money so we need

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,890
to focus time to focus on development

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,070
and support and for that you need to

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,440
paint so we wanted to get directly money

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:54,590
from customers in order to create them

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:57,440
of a poet yes but I don't remember the

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:01,340
name but I mean we were left with

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:06,650
flashing all the time you know really

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:10,610
nice and the question about freemium is

00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:14,330
interesting we really thought about that

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:19,220
wide that we talking first it's really

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:21,950
it's it's our key it's it's not worth it

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:25,880
for cash for caching plug-in and - a

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,580
freemium model because what will have

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,280
the most impact on the performance is

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:37,550
create a static - okay and everything

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,770
will be of course better with less not

00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:43,160
miss minification

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:44,570
the main importance yeah and so which

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,240
means that if you want to different

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:52,940
phenomena to put free there's that

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:56,780
attached so now it brings you to the

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,890
paid features yeah yeah which won't be

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,060
exact machine

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:06,110
yeah like person and so pointed about

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:08,840
exactly and this of course is quits -

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:11,270
quits a lot of Hugh's danger a lot of

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,080
support we really wanted to force

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:17,600
providing great supports which is far as

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,750
possible since we have a premium model

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,550
yeah but speaking about support if

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,250
you're providing support right now

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,680
in French and in English race but ever

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:31,550
were different which is before it yes we

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:35,090
were provided we are providing by one of

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:39,530
me in a way and that was one some

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:41,510
mistakes we did I believe is so we are

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:44,960
working with Murphy and we hire people

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:47,590
from all around the world and one day we

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,529
hired a German guy

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:53,679
I speak German so we say all let's do it

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:56,289
government support yeah and people give

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,600
me happy I mean to to create a ticket to

00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:01,419
German and German you always do have

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,700
some customers from Germany exactly and

00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:06,759
we did the same with someone who were

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,590
speaking in Spanish Italian that was

00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:12,100
pretty good but at the end that doesn't

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,749
really enter into a strategy and and

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:18,220
something we can win your food because

00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:21,909
when the German guy is living for

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,259
holidays anymore supports yeah I tell

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:26,009
you the same and that's really

00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,450
complicated and that brings so much

00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:31,570
difficulties to manage multiple language

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:34,899
especially in for small companion ideas

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,970
so that's why we decided to move this

00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,950
one we didn't to do army supports in

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:44,259
English and French but you get the

00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:46,960
French yeah because it's I mean we

00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:50,190
equated dorky pocket in France we have

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,679
used people people are used to create to

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,529
submit in French I'm a native here oh

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,320
yeah exactly and French people don't

00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:02,980
necessarily talk very well English and a

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,960
lot of recommendation we add on French

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,139
blog post what they were saying okay and

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,879
they have a friendship or transitions of

00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:10,690
people expect to have support in French

00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:14,440
exactly

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,990
so that's right for now we we still do

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,690
French tickets yeah but you still turned

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,299
it to rocket city don't speak English I

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,350
mean let's pick different time with you

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:30,970
right so like Spanish Portuguese yeah I

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:33,100
will tell you every thing we don't have

00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,409
a specific country as a target of course

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,389
the US is the biggest market so this is

00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:39,970
the biggest not the of course and so we

00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:41,289
are targeting more us because you should

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,360
target them you know that you are going

00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:45,309
to attach more people directly instead

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,950
of doing small countries what about

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:53,110
other english-speaking countries I mean

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:55,460
Canada UK yeah yeah they are big markets

00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:00,050
bit smaller than us

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,430
so yes how what part of all customers us

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,360
customers represent

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:09,610
yeah yeah I think if I remember the

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,610
numbers it's about thirty percent and

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:18,140
what kind of customer it's time to call

00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:21,110
customer for that there is he greeted

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:25,430
the best is a bad thing because it's

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:28,160
basically any wordpress user any was a

00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,960
website and that a good thing and the

00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,140
thing I love with WordPress is you can

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,710
add like local which turns where its own

00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,620
website

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,450
the bloggers photographer of the huge

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:44,450
agency or the big government website Oh

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:51,550
exactly exactly and so out these are our

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:54,650
customers but typical like typical image

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:58,850
yes of course kind of you know you are

00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:02,230
we have bloggers which is quite neat we

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:05,390
have the agencies we have hosting so

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:08,570
different kind of customers which will

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:11,420
buy different kind of licenses for

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,820
supporter westerns we know which is not

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,860
very techy with with by using the

00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,340
license points on website and we'll need

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,250
a lot of support and help when the

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,290
developers when will buy it more meeting

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,730
licenses and our more techies which

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,810
would be much more in there for them but

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,980
we don't really focus on specific people

00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:34,730
because there are so many differences

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,980
and that doesn't reverse it so we focus

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:42,320
on WordPress users yeah just WordPress

00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:46,190
videos here it works comparison to your

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,990
sponsoring yeah I want to ask how do you

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,140
feel about sponsoring what caps

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:56,120
does it doing in your revenue to company

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:59,600
oh it's just like like give it away yeah

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,430
a good question so we experimented a lot

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,880
about that especially at the beginning

00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:07,690
when we we wanted to be known outside of

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,500
France so to do that response fault

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:14,650
what sample from our feedback and from

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,590
our stats we have seen that in terms of

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:21,850
revenue for us it didn't really worth it

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:25,360
because it's the way we sponsors is

00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:28,480
being in a way because we always prefer

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,310
to take one of the biggest sponsorship

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,170
which allow us to have a table when we

00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:37,780
can totally be possible and to be able

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:41,140
to talk means customers talk means

00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:43,990
people to explain them because some some

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:47,440
technical and complicated for them it's

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,660
important to show them and we have seen

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,110
that it's quite costly because you have

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,910
the sponsor you need to bring the team

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,750
and you have to pick your tail so it's

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:02,500
really a big budget and at the end if

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:07,060
you can have like 5 6 q story it's quite

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,020
big and for for business I guess where

00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,740
the cost is not very expensive when

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,060
you're you know

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,280
so the we've neutral user is not be

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,850
investing multiple tasks tab dollars to

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:25,450
12 5 customers is really not a good

00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:31,330
solution that's not better way to invest

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:33,100
money if you want we need investment and

00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:38,010
we try in different in different

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:40,920
countries so that the feedback for us

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:44,800
for other company can work very well

00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:52,300
especially for hosting a lot of example

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:54,490
some all the French port company now

00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,560
there are we do reference the WordPress

00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,620
committee that's because they invested

00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,390
so to be knowledge maybe it can be

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,400
useful so we love WordPress we love

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,110
WordPress community and we have so many

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,090
things to give it back because we are

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,399
living around waiting company it's

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,200
thanks to WordPress that's quite great

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,669
if you think that something free some

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,250
single purchase rules and we are living

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:20,980
we're like 20 people living sex two

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,470
things to that so we have decided that

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,230
we will sponsor all the French and what

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,060
games just in order to keep to give back

00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,570
we know that it's not going to bring us

00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:36,220
customers but we sponsor every French

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:38,230
word games it was a solution of facility

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,260
because a lot of what camps are

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,060
contacting us to sponsor and sometimes

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,370
we were saying yeah so it seems like a

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,290
nice Cod camp it was difficult to choose

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,450
and at the end to say you know and the

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:52,149
way to explain the reason so we decided

00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,730
to only sponsor French yeah now it's

00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,630
really clear if people are asking no

00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:03,480
response only French what's good yeah

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,480
but now after broke it is five years old

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,230
if you know all this story before

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,180
what would he change his strategy in

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:18,130
marketing and hiring process I mean in

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:21,160
development model I think I would change

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,110
nothing because with you know we never

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,480
know if you change thing may be either

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:30,670
Twitter's I mean it's like butterfly

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,710
effect you know you said one thing but

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,420
you changed everything so I mean with

00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,160
with the result we have today I'm

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,770
extremely happy with what we have been

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,770
able to build with the great customers

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,990
with the great team with everything so I

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,450
wouldn't change anything because you

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,930
don't know impact and even if we fail

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:54,100
things being able to we have learned so

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,930
much yeah keep like the thing yeah yes

00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,150
said that's in the beginning there were

00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,650
so you made doubly broke it and you may

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,800
need to measure five anyway something

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:06,160
else and now it was like a great

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,610
decision that time to spread between

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,190
different directions but now even if I

00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,020
is developing as well and you're

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,120
preparing on the product you're going to

00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:18,640
double it media is rocket sedan right

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,210
exactly so this is your strategy for the

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,820
future

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:26,260
yeah our strategies we need to focus on

00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:28,660
performance and to find pain points for

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,270
users which is difficult for them they

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,930
don't necessarily so get this

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,700
users different products exactly you

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:40,140
don't we need to target the same users

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:42,720
performance and with WP rocket we really

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,530
want to make performance easy and

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:51,990
understandable and I mean you able WP

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:54,450
rocket means it's working yes and we

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:58,080
build mattifies things - the feedback of

00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:00,660
our customers they say what kind of how

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,230
can i optimize languages I don't like

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,120
what what exists and we say we look at

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,130
the other product or very good but we

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,770
wanted to do something a bit different

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,450
so we say okay give us six months and we

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,450
provide you something and we provide

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,250
them a mattifying today we optimize more

00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:21,870
than one millions of immediate spending

00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:28,170
today not working pretty well and we are

00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:29,900
preparing to win his pocket because we

00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:33,630
see that people don't necessarily

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,030
understand yeah it can be complicated

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,190
for them to have a CPM on their own

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,140
website if complete detail for

00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,180
developers yeah I mean for the input I

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,220
mean you need to register to an external

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,620
service great to see nm and then when

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,810
you find your DNS and then I mean

00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,670
configure it because by default the

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,430
performance is not necessary good

00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,830
because they deserve everything and then

00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,080
add it into your plugin which helps

00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,120
again what we want to provide this one

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,190
fixed solution for CTO so directly from

00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:07,560
WP walk and say enable those unions I

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,300
mean it sounds like logical after all

00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,340
it's in that will pro kit

00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,870
you made you fight it's illogical but

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:17,310
sounds really cool yeah yeah yeah so if

00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,860
you think you very much for this

00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:22,500

I'm so honored to be here to talk to you

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,220
