Title: Ricky Blacker: How WordPress Changed My Life!
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	WordPress has become a passion of mine and I love to share this personal journey of how WordPress has changed my life for the better in many ways … and continues to do so. I share my story to inspire others to become more involved with the WordPress community and also to follow their dreams.
WordPress has taken me from a factory job that I was NOT happy in, to loving my work in an amazing company and being paid to travel the world and interact with the WordPress community.
This talk tells of how ‘discovering’ WordPress became a life-changing experience – how I was adopted into the WordPress community who are now like family to me, and how attending WordCamp Sydney in 2014 lead to a series of events that paved the way to me acquiring my dream job.
During my talk I give examples of how giving back to the WordPress community can be beneficial in many ways. Hopefully, I inspire those just embarking on their WordPress journey to follow their dreams, and encourage people by sharing how overcoming some of our fears and social anxieties can lead to amazing opportunities.

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,530
single does magic

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,680
should be just there weaker okay so when

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,080
I wrote this talk this is the third time

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,890
I've given this talk and it involves

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,920
every time and the reason I wrote it

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,640
because I thought I was a bit unique in

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,240
what my story with WordPress was but as

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,230
I talk to people and you know you

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,510
interact with a lot of people with the

00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,460
WordPress community I found out that my

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,369
story isn't unique everybody's story is

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,869
unique and it's everybody's got a really

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,790
good story about how they got involved

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:05,440
with WordPress and how editing packs

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,360
their lives and for anybody who's seen

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,110
the articles from hero press has anybody

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,020
seen those so Topher DeRussy

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,890
I met him personally he's a really great

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,570
guy he has the hero press and he has

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,910
articles from people and how WordPress

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,070
has changed their lives and it's really

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,440
inspiring to see where people have come

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,350
from and how much WordPress is made

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,660
their lives better but this is my story

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,330
and to tell my story we've got to go

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,790
back in time a little bit so we've gone

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:42,010
back in time back to 2013 all the way

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,230
back then now the first time I gave this

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,260
talk it wasn't so far back and now it's

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,640
getting further and further away so back

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,110
in 2013 I was working in a factory

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,030
there's me a couple of mates wearing the

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,170
fluoro driving forklifts all that kind

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,610
of stuff but they decided to shut down

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,220
the factory and I'd been working there

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,410
for 20 years and that's pretty much all

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,420
I knew apart from fixing computers on

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,810
the side and I taught myself a little

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,970
bit of HTML CSS so I had to reinvent my

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,810
career so I started looking around for

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,810
something to do so I decided to get into

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,750
web design now one of the things I was

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,170
really keen on doing back in those days

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:30,130
I was a very avid gamer anybody hear

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,390
game play games computer games yeah you

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,950
know how much time you can waste on

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,120
those but those have got kids who are

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,170
playing computer games you know what

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,819
it's like they're on there all the time

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,879
but I was really bad at it

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,230
I'd play for hours and hours on end but

00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,340
I had to learn how to be a web developer

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,799
so I had to study so I had to stop

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,769
playing games that was the first thing

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,360
that changed a big change in my life I

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,340
went from wasting six to eight hours a

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,739
day playing computer games to actually

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,909
learning about web design and that kind

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:03,010
of stuff so I then realized no one

00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,989
probably employ me so I had to start my

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,700
own business so I started a company

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:11,109
called data guru and I started building

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,790
websites for customers now back then I

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:17,169
was just doing everything in plain old

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,880
HTML CSS with notepad plus plus and then

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,400
I heard about this thing called a CMS

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,430
and I thought hmm this sounds like fun

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,410
so I did a lot of research a lot of

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,940
research and of course the two free main

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,190
open source CMS's a WordPress Drupal and

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,169
Joomla so I did a lot of research to

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,300
find out which one was the best one and

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,830
then I thought I'll pick that one and

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:46,389
learn a lot about it and of course I

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:48,430
picked not just kidding now I picked a

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,430
WordPress I did a lot of research and

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,620
all the forums and all the research I

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,310
did pointed to with WordPress being the

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,919
best and obviously I mean Joomla in you

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,990
know Drupal very good but as we know

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,810
WordPress now has what thirty four

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,690
thirty five percent of the web so it was

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:12,160
a good choice so I started learning

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,139
about WordPress and I found going online

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,699
and finding as much information as I

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,889
could there's lots of information out

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,250
there lots of videos but one of the

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,139
greatest resource I found was on it was

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,560
called lynda.com I think people know it

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:29,560
now is LinkedIn learning but I went on

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
there and I want rent Hendrickson so

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,849
anybody who knows like who lives in the

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,060
WordPress world there's probably heard

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,770
his name is very vocal on accessibility

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,970
and all sorts of things but he's also a

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,560
really good trainer

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,960
for WordPress so if anybody's out there

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,380
starting out highly recommend watching

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,150
his videos but that really changed how I

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,169
did things and so I'm learning that this

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,770
point I was learning how to use

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:57,410
WordPress I hadn't actually used it yet

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,930
so does anybody remember this the old

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,930
manual install of WordPress so the first

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,900
time this is my first time I decided to

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:09,440
build out a wordpress site and it was

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,540
amazing okay that what that wasn't it

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,729
but it wasn't far from that but the

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,729
thing was what it used to take me a week

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,910
or two with just plain text and HTML and

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:22,280
CSS I did in like four hours my first

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,520
attempt and I had a five six page

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,840
website with images and menu and

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,380
everything was working and it was

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,479
amazing enough I thought this is great

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,550
but then there was a problem this was

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,680
the point I nearly broke up with

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,479
WordPress because I was looking for a

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,810
business and I was looking for people to

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,970
pay me to build websites and because I'd

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,990
built this site with really little

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,180
training and not real a lot of knowledge

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,539
and I built it very quickly but who is

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,789
going to pay me to build WordPress site

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,590
so I kind of thought well this is a bit

00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,729
of a waste of time because you know I'm

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,740
not going to make any money out of it

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,570
but I talked to some people and they

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,080
said look you really can make money out

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,260
of building WordPress sites so I started

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,630
falling in love with WordPress and as

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,639
you all know WordPress is amazing and

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,050
people do pay for people to build

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,410
WordPress sites even though you can do

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,570
it yourself it's like I you know I can

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,949
basically fix a car but I prefer to pay

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,490
somebody else to do it or wash it then I

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:32,240
started going to meet up so I what my

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,820
phones talking to me so has anybody here

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,240
go to a WordPress meetup or any kind of

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,490
meetups so I found the meetup by

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,229
accident while searching for something

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,550
about WordPress and came across a

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,750
WordPress meetup and I thought this

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:50,240
sounds interesting so I went along and

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,660
there was a lot of people dead a lot of

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,990
people and I'm not a real outgoing

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,960
person I'm very shy so I went to the

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,750
talk and I set actually set up the front

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,919
but I set by myself and then at the end

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,780
of the meetup

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,180
decide they said oh we're all going to a

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,789
pub you know to a bar and we're going to

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,009
talk and you get to network and have fun

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,210
and and I thought I don't know if want

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,909
to do this I'm not the kind of person

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:21,620
you can just sort of meet people I was

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:24,020
very shy so but I did it and I went

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,659
along but I kind of felt a bit left out

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,249
everybody was in their groups and I

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,680
didn't really know anyone it was hard to

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,839
sort of get to talk to I sort of

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,510
wandered around and sort of has anybody

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,740
been in that situation it's sort of

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,959
wandering around and you don't know who

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,880
to talk to and you kind of stand

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,560
listening on conversation and then you

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,120
walk up somewhere else and listen on

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,980
someone else's conversation so I did

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,339
that and didn't really get to know

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,620
anyone I felt I kind of bit left out but

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,410
I kept going I kept young every month

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,209
I'd go to the meetup and I think people

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,699
started feeling sorry for me you want

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,709
you know but now people started

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,209
realizing I was coming over and over

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,300
again and they started talking to me and

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,370
I made friends and it was hard at first

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,600
because I you know for those people who

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,390
are shy it's hard to go out and meet

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,459
people but I did it and those friends

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,550
that I made back then are still really

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:20,870
good friends now today and a big reason

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,029
that I'm standing here right now and

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,120
then these new friends told me about a

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:30,579
word camp now I live in Brisbane and the

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,930
word camp coming up in Sydney and I

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:35,570
didn't know what to do I've never been

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,279
to a conference before never been to a

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,589
word camp but I saved up all my money

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,269
and I flew down the Sydney and I went to

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,850
my first word camp and that really

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:48,740
changed my life who's here for the first

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:53,060
time for a word camp who's here like

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,470
he's been to many many word camps yep so

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,720
those who who put your hands up for the

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,839
first time expect to keep coming back

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,449
they're very addictive so when - my

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,399
first word camp once again I was very

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:08,870
shy didn't know I had a few people on

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,430
you but yeah I kind of think was I made

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,839
some really good friends I made like a

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,170
really good friend on the first day I

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,600
met this guy waiting to like registered

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,980
we got talking and and we end up sitting

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
next to each other in it just about

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,089
every talk and you make some really good

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,220
friends you make some good connections

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,140
at word camps and you'll learn a lot of

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,610
cool stuff probably won't learn much in

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,420
my talk but in the other talks you'll

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,269
learn some cool stuff but then I saw

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,649
these people up talking and this is

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,620
actually one of one of the friends I've

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,880
made this is Luke Carver's and he was

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,550
talking but there's lots of other people

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,949
talking and I thought you know what one

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,140
day I want to be up at a word camp and

00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,760
talk they'll be really cool maybe four

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,680
or five years down the track when I get

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,690
some experience and I know what I'm

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,350
talking about I hope to be one of those

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:01,190
people less than 12 months later I was

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,959
up talking at a word camp they were had

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,720
one in Brisbane and when the organizer

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,430
said you should talk I said well I don't

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,019
know what I've got nothing to talk about

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,510
he said just pick a topic that you're

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,880
good at all interested in or know

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,640
something about and he really encouraged

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,610
me and that his name was Bronson quick

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,610
and here's a really good community

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,529
member in Australia he really encouraged

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,050
me and so I I submitted to talk and I

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,640
got accepted didn't get accepted till

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,410
the very end so I kept thinking I wasn't

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,699
accepted but in the end they sent me an

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,730
email and said you can come home and

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:39,589
talk and so I went and did my first talk

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:42,680
was on child themes and I was nervous

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,970
and I didn't really know what I was

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,720
talking about but I did it I know I had

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,519
a really great time so really encourage

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,920
you for those who are sitting out the

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,079
audience think about when word camps and

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,610
meetups are coming up don't be afraid to

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,689
stand up and talk bits it's a really

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,579
good experience even if you're shy and

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,140
then I saw all the people who are

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,970
organizing the word camp but these are

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,160
all my friends that I've made in

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,470
Brisbane and you know WordPress in

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,630
general and I saw them organizing the

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,100
word camp and I said you know what in a

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,640
couple of years time would be really

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,860
good if I could organize a word camp

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,529
less than twelve months later I was

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,110
organizing my own word camp with a whole

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,999
heap of other people

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,220
Elsword camp Sunshine Coast

00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:31,729
and it was great as a great experience

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,439
it was it's hectic and when you do one

00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:35,659
you wonder why you ever do one because

00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:38,239
it's it's very stressful and it's a lot

00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:40,999
of work but it's people keep doing it

00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:43,159
it's it's great fun so the thing is

00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,949
we're just normal people who organize

00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,449
work camps we're just volunteers and a

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,769
lot of times it's you'll be sitting

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,569
around at a coffee shop and going let's

00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,189
do a word camp and that's where it comes

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:57,499
from and then it turns into something

00:12:52,189 --> 00:13:00,199
like this so here I was I was now drawn

00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:04,519
into word camps I was a speaker I was an

00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:06,679
organizer and also I was helping run a

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,999
lot of the meetups so when I started

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,889
going to meetups a lot of people that

00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:12,019
helped me and I really appreciated all

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,879
the help and the the friends I made and

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,799
I I kept saying how can I help and and

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,029
when you go to meetups I always say if

00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,409
you want to help you know come and see

00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,909
us and I thought what I don't know what

00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,279
I can do to help but I kept saying if

00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,889
there's anything I could do and one of

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,859
the meetup organizers said ah you can

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,989
help me run it so I said yeah sure and

00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:32,029
then he said I'm going up like overseas

00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:35,509
next month you can run the whole meetup

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:39,379
so that was my first taste of running a

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:41,209
meet-up all by myself but then I started

00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:43,159
helping and got involved with a lot of

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,379
other meetups and it's really good to

00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:49,959
give back and to help the community and

00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:52,429
to you know make these meetups happen

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,939
and there's the there's a couple of

00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,049
people in WordPress Brisbane and

00:13:54,939 --> 00:14:00,679
Sunshine Coast and we all have a good

00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:03,829
time learn stuff have pizza sometimes we

00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:06,529
have beer and then I realized I was

00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,509
doing something something I had never

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,419
done before

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:14,269
networking not that kind of networking

00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:16,970
that kind of networking now I've been

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,499
working in a factory and you know never

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,109
had to do any of this kind of stuff and

00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:22,609
I was going to these meetups and I

00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,729
didn't realize I was doing it I was

00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:27,589
making friends just having a good time

00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:30,769
but I was actually networking meeting

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,689
people building relationships and I had

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,089
that business side started and I was

00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:37,279
teaching myself as I went and my

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,770
business started to grow because people

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,560
knew me and they would

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,600
worked to me and get you know like it

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,220
was really great for my business it

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,760
wasn't what I set out to do it was just

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,080
a nice side effect so that was really

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,330
amazing then I got a really strange

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,310
thing happen I went to the door a guy

00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,810
asked me to do a website for him I told

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,029
him how much would it cost you nearly

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,810
fell off his chair and he said you want

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,399
to get fit I said actually I do so we

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,140
had a deal where I'd build him a website

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,149
and he'd trained me to like be my

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,240
personal trainer and I actually got

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,430
really fit and you notice there's

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,670
something missing there like a big belly

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,250
so that was that was really good

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,360
that was a long time ago since follow

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,240
falling off the car back to my fat self

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,040
but but that was amazing and then I

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,680
needed I realized I need some help my

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,959
business as well so I've been told about

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,630
Troy Dean and WP elevation for a long

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:42,130
time and I finally bit the bulletin and

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:43,720
joint the WP elevation course and that

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,690
really changed the way my business it

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,550
look I'm Finnegan they're amazing

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,050
but yeah I did the course and that

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,579
really helped with my business once

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,620
again I had my business going really

00:15:51,579 --> 00:16:01,060
well had all sorted out and then I went

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:03,880
to word camp Sydney 2016 and I gave this

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,820
exact talk how WordPress changed my life

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:11,050
and it was really good I was Fiat elf in

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,890
my business was going good and the talk

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,550
went really well

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:19,660
and that's where my talk ended sort of

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:23,670
back in Sydney 2016 but I've given this

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,410
talk a few more times and there's more I

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,779
was very active with Brisbane I was

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,350
helping organize I now co-organized the

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:35,459
word camp Brisbane word camp which is

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,649
actually happening next weekend

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,089
and I was working well it's a very good

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,779
photo that's a friend of mine called

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:47,170
Dion now Dion actually is one the lead

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:51,070
developers for automatic but basically

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,800
he builds WordPress and I noticed him

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,050
and a couple

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,880
other people that I knew who are working

00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,380
for big companies like you know human

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,670
made and xwp and automatic and now we're

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:08,270
getting trips to WordCamp u.s. wordcamp

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,939
europe WordCamp this flying around the

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,709
world for retreats I thought to myself

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,140
that's really cool I wish I could do

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,300
that and also heard about a job called a

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,390
wordpress evangelist I thought that that

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,980
sounds like something I could do so all

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,839
my friends were going all to these word

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
camps and getting paid to go it wasn't

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,030
like they have to dig into her own

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,650
pocket and I thought I want to do that

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,210
and you can kind of see a bit of a trend

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,710
going here whenever I sort of put my

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,460
mind to something it seems to happen

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,830
wherever I wanted to or not so I wanted

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,040
to do that I want to work for a company

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:47,000
that would pay me to go to word camps

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,510
and have fun and out of the blue WP

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,429
engine came along so I was kind of doing

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,710
the community thing and working my

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,290
business and I was at a meet-up and this

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,710
guy came along said hey would you like

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,470
to work for WP engine I said sure I

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,290
didn't think I'd get the job but I did I

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,630
got I started working for WP engine shut

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:13,460
down my business and I started working

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,870
for them and I get to travel I've since

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,590
I've started with WP engine I've

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:21,440
traveled to Texas to Austin Texas to

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:24,200
Phoenix Arizona word Camp Phoenix been

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,640
to word camp Wellington where I also

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,950
tricked them into giving me a standing

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,260
ovation I've been to London I've been to

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,100
Limerick Ireland this is our Limerick

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,950
team in London team and I've been at

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,660
Singapore and as well I travel all

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,450
around Australia and go to meetups and

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,700
word camps and this is you know like

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,250
this all came from the main reason

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,530
that's happening it's because I was

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:55,970
going to meetups I was being active in

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,940
the community and I got noticed and it

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,760
was all because I started up off with

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,530
WordPress that that one day when I'd

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,739
looked into all those different CMS's

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,940
and didn't choose Joomla I

00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:10,799
but one last thing I'm going to wrap it

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,879
up really quickly because we are getting

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,759
close to lunchtime one last being of all

00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:19,440
those things one of the coolest things I

00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,879
started networking ball when I realized

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
I was networking I was looking for other

00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:24,210
opportunities back when I had my

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,059
business and I started going to other

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,789
meetups not just techie ones and I went

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,970
to one it was like a small business meet

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:36,599
up and I was run by this lady over here

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:40,409
called Sally Eberhardt who is now my

00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:43,200
partner so trooll all this wordpress

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:45,479
even brought me love so that was really

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,129
amazing because if I hadn't have found

00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,239
WordPress I wouldn't have gone to meet

00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:51,720
ups I wouldn't have started networking

00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:55,590
and I wouldn't have met her so in

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,159
summary WordPress this may be more

00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,019
confident

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,679
obviously I might be talking I'm not shy

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,899
anymore well still shy but I've made a

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,549
lot of new friends and I've made so many

00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:09,419
cool new friends since I've just been

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:11,159
simple I've achieved my goals like I

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,779
kind of set goals and I achieve them

00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:17,700
there

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:20,779
I've got healthy kind of and I've got a

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:25,019
job that I love so this all adds up to

00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,990
WordPress is awesome and that's it thank

00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:34,259
you Singapore

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:34,259
[Applause]

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:56,780
I'm yep I'm wpengine also have reward

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:59,210
removed work not that we do have a few

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,580
remote people but they're very few we we

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,500
tend we've got a really strong company

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,290
culture and we'd like to keep everybody

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,960
in the office and and you know together

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,720
and you know kind of keeping everybody

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,510
happy and healthy and and having a fun

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,920
time so we I mean as the company's

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,530
evolving there's probably going to be

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,870
more opportunities for remote work and

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,510
we had to I think we fairly got like 13

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,220
people out of 700 but that work remotely

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:30,940
at the moment you're looking for a job

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,940
[Laughter]

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,490
yeah I have a question that we could

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:46,360
give you share about home networking

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:48,940
this yeah I'm actually my my partner she

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,500
actually wrote a book called networking

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,010
for introverts because we're both

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,580
introverts and we like to we're a bit

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,649
shy but one of the main things with

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,450
networking and this is a tip from my

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:04,779
girlfriend she this is a really good tip

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,429
when you do go to an event look for the

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:08,139
person there's other people in the room

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,190
who I show just like you and you'll pick

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:11,799
them out because they're standing by

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,389
themselves in the corner so look for

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,880
those people and just go up and say hi

00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:17,649
because you're both shy and you both

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,179
need that person and then once you've

00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:21,220
got two people then it's a lot easier to

00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,350
go up to a third person and before too

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,730
long you've got a little group so that's

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,830
a really good tip and the other thing is

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,210
just

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,990
especially if WordPress in the community

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,010
that everybody wants to be your friend

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,250
even though it doesn't feel like it at

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,510
first don't be shy to walk up and

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,149
introduce yourself and just start

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,720
talking the WordPress community is one

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:46,600
of the most accepting and most you know

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,610
giving communities I've ever been in and

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,799
if you are in the community and if you

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,260
do like if you regularly attend the

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,990
Meetup and you you know you've got your

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,490
little groups of friends when you do

00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,980
have a meetup just look around for those

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,840
people who are new and you know standing

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,940
by themselves and welcome them in and

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,019
just say hello because you know it

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,019
really does make a big difference

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:18,430
I think that he'll be Funniest Videos

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,430
[Laughter]

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:34,200
yes and come back for the next run I

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,200
