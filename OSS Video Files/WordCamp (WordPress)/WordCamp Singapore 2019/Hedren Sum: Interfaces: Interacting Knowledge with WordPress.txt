Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	Being in an academic environment, we deal with varying formats of content for different audiences and purposes. In this session, I will sharing the process to “look under the hood” in using WordPress, exploring beyond theme applications to develop interfaces that communicate and interact knowledge across both digital and physical environments.

[Applause]

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,569
okay hi a very good morning okay a very

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,599
good morning to all of you

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,660
okay so thanks for the introduction okay

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,160
so I would try to keep it within ten

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,850
minutes right so they have time for

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,080
discussion okay so basically just to

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,300
summarize a little bit of what I'm

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,029
actually doing okay and basically this

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,760
one charge it's all a summarize what as

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,220
you do in the university right so I did

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,710
give a lot of different kind of data

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:36,690
right from across different disciplines

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:38,370
science tech humanities etc and of

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,260
course you know you come up with

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,070
different kind of outputs whether it is

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,680
physical or digital outputs okay and one

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,020
attention is that I work on aroma

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,219
projects I actually cut across different

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,340
disciplines he means one work one

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,579
project cut across different is a often

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,350
interdisciplinary projects okay so I

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,550
think over the course of years of my

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,890
work I develop know several kind of a

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,640
platform or sites using WordPress and

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,799
these as a selected list right it ranges

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,350
from very basic you know all the way to

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,369
pretty I was an advanced platforms like

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,250
that I travel a lot different of api's

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,600
or a lot typical open-source tools which

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,640
I will show today okay so for me I think

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,220
what present awesome platform in the

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,549
sense of I in an era of representing

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,590
knowledge right while I was reflecting

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,600
on what I have been doing over the past

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,000
years I think what paths can be been

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,790
used across different kind of approaches

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,659
right so it could be used as a digital

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,520
showcase right of work it can be used at

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,210
for a digital creation which include

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,060
things like these archiving and stuff

00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:04,020
it's a wonderful tool we use for digital

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,920
storytelling okay right for you so this

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,179
project my starting

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,910
hardware start on this which is always

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,310
pure typing it's always

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,310
sketches

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,459
so before I as you use Adobe experience

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,370
as you used do a lot of sketches on pen

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:25,640
and paper very basic right and this is a

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,830
very important phase very top are

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,080
interfaces because should have a sense

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,880
of thinking you actually identify your

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,030
users you actually identified the key

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,530
functionalities the key features and how

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,800
do the audiences actually interact with

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,560
the different content of your site okay

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,670
so this to me is other than working on

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,769
the design is also an important thinking

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,150
process to get started on designing

00:02:51,769 --> 00:03:00,319
interfaces so for example like this is

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:04,489
one kind of puja using WordPress I call

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,950
it a CV block or a resume block okay so

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,410
this is actually a virtual block a

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,209
virtual CV block for a faculty okay in

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,610
wearable tech okay and on top of that

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,600
represents a Gary we have a view of the

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,910
works okay as I use it to as a host of

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,010
little events as well and one thing

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,750
about what price is that it can be on

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,150
the same site but it can have a

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,430
different looking fume so even though it

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,930
looked as if loss has seams is a is a

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,569
totally different website but actually

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,500
it's as a part of a same blog site so I

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:43,400
use page builder teams to do that okay

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,010
two edges separate you know between a

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,739
standard block for the photo photo

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,410
professor and and then have their own

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:56,389
look and feel for exhibition as part of

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,220
the same block okay I actually extended

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,440
the concept little bit even though the

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,260
previous site is only for one faculty I

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,370
as a standard a little bit in this case

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,200
is like a portfolio and that was a ajik

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,260
contributed by students at the School of

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,500
Design media okay and today we are think

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,010
we have about eight hundred and seventy

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,190
works creative works right so from a

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,650
single CV blow a standard now into a

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,880
portfolio simply using WordPress

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,490
okay and more importantly is to

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,070
see latest scan workflow of the school

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,490
that the summation work Florescu okay

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,840
right so you can see that is like

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,180
there's a listing or all the different

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,820
projects at the front you know puja have

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,490
your own detail page and then it's on a

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,310
student will have their own profile page

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,040
they actually automatically pull their

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,980
work together right providing a snapshot

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,900
of of themselves I also read thing about

00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,660
other ways or how do I present a content

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,400
or Aiden portfolio right so same thing

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,770
you can build something like this a

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,200
major grid that is meant for a large

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,760
screen display right so for example I

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:15,330
events like FIP showcase this can be

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,400
projected on on a large screen okay that

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,980
you can automatically change on a

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,830
certain interval so to take on the

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,260
rivers concept of having separate sites

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,170
as part as I have some insights about

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,540
the same block site right Ike I was a

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,970
standardise to the to the individual

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,480
Indian show so for instance for the same

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,320
EDM portfolio site right soppressata

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,150
have been have been specially designed

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,090
well across such past few years each

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,430
other have only looking few and pulling

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,780
the content a strong contributor from

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,820
the students directly right okay so in

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,440
short actually a lot of times I usually

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,180
use WordPress as a small container okay

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,840
where it provides as a fundamental

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,260
platform okay and as we used a lot

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,660
different series or open source tools to

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,180
actually in certain functionalities of

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,100
WordPress so for instance I did you know

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,260
this as your research blog which I'm I'm

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,560
part it is such a part of research and

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:26,250
as a part involving okay I attempt on

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,000
different kind of sorry given kind of

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,570
platforms

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,880
okay for example like map box to

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,180
bootstrap libraries right to JavaScript

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,889
libraries right to build a person like

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,280
this okay

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:45,580
I use like a m-v-c model to think about

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,830
how do I deal with data how do I deal

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,080
with the interfaces how do the users as

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,090
you interact with the content okay what

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,110
are the different directions right

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,710
so these as you saw my course okay

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,150
and from this it arrives with this

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,969
whereby it's interactive people can zoom

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,069
in zoom out click on any part of the map

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:08,349
right and then view information and the

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,349
next phase is to enter it to link this

00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:19,810
with web 3d modeling data which I have

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:21,699
okay all right so enjoy what con is

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,469
actually to create a research Porter to

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,409
think about how actually researchers

00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:28,419
across different teams can work together

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:31,719
and share information so this is an

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,789
example site where by about 20 okay

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:37,020
about different tween 20 researchers

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:39,370
working on science space in South Asia

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,789
they are all from different countries

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,589
even or 11 different countries right and

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,199
they actually I usually use WordPress to

00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:50,289
design a certain way on how they can

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,330
show you information and so it is

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,520
architecture diagram okay I just going

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,389
to fast forward a little bit so it

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,360
showed

00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,690
if so the team had our own space you

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,400
know is I call it sites right okay we

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,110
have our inside pin arrow inside you're

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,939
gonna go inside okay and we such as does

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,669
fear schools chemists the Gowanus I'll

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,080
go to the on site and collect data so

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,150
one other thing is that how do I

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,889
actually make it into something that you

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,360
can contribute the site using a mobile

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,219
phone okay so this is one okay they can

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,580
actually insert the content and then the

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:31,289
location of where the data is that get

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:36,159
from is automatically aggregated right

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:37,599
and then it links isolates to individual

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,810
postings on WordPress

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,910
right so just just to end our leidos

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,040
present somehow further possibilities of

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,500
wordpress a lot of these I were talking

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,569
about now it's more towards the digital

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,230
site of things came into this to the

00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:58,550
commuters to the screen fat screen okay

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,819
that sorry that's it they're saying it

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:08,629
by fears ago by Jeff fishnet with the

00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:09,920
founder for the founder for the metal

00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:11,839
that at Hobart University

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,579
okay so he said I know there's a certain

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,290
point where people really will get tired

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,430
of screens

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,230
okay and we will need to think about

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,699
alternative ways or how we can interact

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:26,509
with content right Denis basically a

00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:29,870
richer so-called sensorium of content so

00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:33,589
this brings me to you know how do we

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:38,930
actually extend out the content on on on

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:42,439
the screen to physical spaces right so

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:45,319
what is it like to view a block site in

00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:48,199
a submission as an auditor archive in

00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:50,829
the exhibition okay or how can we use

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:53,449
what process as a digital installation

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:56,180
okay so these two years that the first

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,339
two right is actually an ex power

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,410
installation or exhibition at the art

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:03,019
science museum right powered by

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,810
WordPress as well right and the third

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:08,389
one is actually a digital chaos put it

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,459
on the last touch screen is actually

00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:14,839
presented at the United Nations in

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,130
Geneva LEDs here right so these are one

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,139
thing are this these are the different

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:22,399
kind of interactions and how actually

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,720
can we design the interface to consider

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,990
all these different interactions

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,149
coincide right of course you have been

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,949
talking about responsive layouts but

00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,689
probably the next step of thing ever

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:36,620
interfaces is how do we actually insert

00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:39,439
somehow sensoria Oh howdy relates to the

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,800
physical environments I'm talking about

00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:46,189
something like this right what role can

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,019
WordPress do how can we use WordPress

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:52,399
for such things okay

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,319
we have all these different kind of

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,819
mediums that dome lock screens

00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:01,910
projection mapping ARV ARV our web 3d

00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:03,999
motion motion detection sensors AI so

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,039
how do we actually

00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,529
type on these and then integrate it into

00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,699
a web into WordPress remember the

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,479
earlier point I mentioned that use

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:16,419
WordPress as a container right yeah so I

00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:19,299
think essentially this my essentially

00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:22,149
what press is not a standalone thing you

00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,589
you need solve a set of different skill

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,059
sets

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:32,889
mento but design interfaces right

00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:36,039
visuals the content and then also the

00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,679
overall experience right how do I use

00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:46,569
this as a interrelation avatar of

00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:49,209
content video text images okay so future

00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:51,339
work as mentioned I I just started my

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:55,239
PhD and I'll be looking into this area

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,199
of interfaces and in greater detail

00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,809
right

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:00,159
I'm assests we conceptually we

00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,309
conceptualizing the word interface

00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:08,349
always back from the Renaissance period

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:09,579
okay so good luck to me okay thank you

00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:20,339
thank you yes I have

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:20,339
yeah thank you yeah or to me okay yes

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,940
hey I have two shots question actually

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,270
basically the first one when you showed

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,800
her portfolio

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,020
so what assumption is the more typical

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,959
Pressman they have a lot of images your

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,160
personal issue like the time to do you

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,080
know I don't know whether they something

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,910
it's a challenging encounter around this

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,490
area that WordPress penny

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,940
absolutely searching engine optimization

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,430
when user in Kahala the second thing I

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,610
wanted to find on is on the knowledge

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,730
from that what particular resource like

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,200
do you use in the form of press /

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,360
technical plugins or anything to simply

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,950
buy quality product because the

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,380
reintegration as they have not holder

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,779
but it's a nice way that you can invite

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,720
her opposite if I'm on TV

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,330
you mean from the founder from one on

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,149
the archive - okay okay so the answer

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,820
your first question is that yes images

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,100
always pose a performing issue on

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,080
wordpress okay but so for example like

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,579
this okay this this FIP okay we also

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,040
need to consider this is a very very

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,140
point so when they when a student are so

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,290
cost submitting their work one way is

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,870
that we of course I use formidable form

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:42,480
bodies so there's a way to limit the

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:43,649
size of images okay yeah so Camille I

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,380
said yeah the uploader

00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,480
5 MB image single image you will not

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,220
work because I said it to a sudden

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
adding 1 MB or something like that that

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,920
is one way of doing it okay is to

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,220
restrict at least at least the create

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,649
post creation level ok restrict the size

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,630
of the images of content okay

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,450
and now way is actually for better is

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,640
that we also think of using things like

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,730
Amazon or something that chemists you

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,510
host your images somewhere else okay and

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,680
then and then basically when when

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,089
loading that time you're actually not

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,339
loading they're ready for your WordPress

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:23,790
server as you're loading for my external

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,610
image server yeah you can do that yeah

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,230
yeah actually I used that for to

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:32,370
optimize the performance on the site so

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,020
I use all our CD ends right okay to

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,970
either a second question on this

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:42,760
knowledge flow

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:45,740
this thing is it okay okay

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,810
the difficult the developer is actually

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,530
to understand how each of these plucking

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,110
works okay but fortunately although

00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,900
these plugins do provide some color like

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,090
a JavaScript library the approval or

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,820
examples they can educate copy and paste

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:06,110
a course in and did a quick configure

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,970
some kind of settings okay as it for me

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,140
that you are ready the developer is

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,570
ready know about the integration that

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,830
were is actually how you saw this work

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,240
together right so for example like

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,260
following formula phone is being used

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,900
for that data creation chemist inserting

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,620
inputting data bootstrap is thinking of

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,360
a layout right the theme Divi theme page

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,170
builder team is allow me to actually

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,570
target on design different interfaces

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,150
for a certain group of audience or

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:44,770
purpose right so I think that's the

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:44,770
