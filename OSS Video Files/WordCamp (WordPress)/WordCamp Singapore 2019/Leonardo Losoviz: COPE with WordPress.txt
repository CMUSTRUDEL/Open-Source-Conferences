Description: 
	COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) is a technique which allows to publish content across different platforms from a single source of truth, enabling to feed content to dissimilar platforms such as web, emails, or an iOS or Android app, while minimizing the amount of duplicated information and reducing maintenance to the minimum possible.
Through Gutenberg, WordPress splits the post content into blocks which can be handled independently, thus enabling the implementation of the COPE strategy. This makes WordPress an ideal platform for hosting the content that will be distributed to different platforms. In this talk we will take a look into a WordPress-based architecture to implement COPE, and how it works.
