talking SEO for business all right

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,029
so before I start I like to get an idea

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
of who I'm talking to

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,689
so would you be able to raise your hands

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,420
if you know what SEO is if you know what

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,949
it is all right and why don't we keep

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,820
them up keep them up keep them up let's

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,560
hope of them to go yet all right keep

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,239
those hands up why don't we and I want

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,290
you to keep your hand up if you've done

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,890

you very much that gives me a real good

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,110
understanding of who we're talking to

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,390
today because when you're paid to do SEO

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,770
and you know a lot of us hear about it

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,360
but it doesn't give me a bit more of an

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,059
understanding of who I'm talking to

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,320
so you've heard my introduction today my

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,420

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,369
not long ago we niche down into DB and

00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,680
unfortunately DB has a trademark on it

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,479
and I faced a bit of a disaster with the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
fact that we had to change our name

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,159
because I realized my name was

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,470
trademarked by somebody else not a good

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,210
day what I realized I mean has changed

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,229
that I wrote about that on the blog at

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:26,640

no affiliate links just enjoy all right

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,659
but let's get into it today so I've got

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,939
heaps of years experience in HTML CSS

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,070
and JavaScript I actually started coding

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,369
when I was about six years old my dad

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,380
taught me to code on a vic-20 with basic

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,780
on the Commodore vic-20 years before the

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,850
Commodore 64 and he taught me how to

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,290
make times tables applications and a few

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,110
different things and then I learnt DOS

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,060
and so my comfort was the green screen

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,050
black screen kind of thing with the

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,600
Green Tech

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,810
that's my happy place and it's still my

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,480
happy place all right but I know all

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,510
this HTML CSS and JavaScript so why did

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,709
I get into SEO and it simply comes down

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,930
to this it's the best way to get

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,890
business results you see we're building

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:35,040
websites good code nice designs and no

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,230
traffic and why because we didn't I

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,810
didn't understand SEO you know without

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,970
this key part we're doing a discredit to

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,880
the rest of our work all right we're

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,350
doing a discredit to it so today we're

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,820
going to go through a basic

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,769
understanding of getting business

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,160
results with SEO what do you need to

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,720
know and what do you have to do okay so

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,760
first of all we're gonna say what is SEO

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,459
I'm gonna bring us some new times for

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,200
you all right because we've kind of

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,110
complicated a bit because most of us

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,269
have been nerdy pasty skinned guys with

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,569
a death-metal shirt on that sits in the

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,360
corner coding away with us ultra big

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,160
gaming headset on and he's coding away

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,890
aggressively and whenever you ask any

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,230
question he's like dude dude as if you

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,970
don't know not when I'm not that kind of

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,790
guy I love sharing which is why I'm here

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,130
today right so we go what is SEO what

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,049
makes the best page for SEO you know why

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,049
does Google pick the top page when we go

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,150
into that what is good content what

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,299
makes a fast page how do I measure my

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,739
results how can social media help my SEO

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,829
and where do I start

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,560
all right where do I get started so

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,750
let's get into it first of all what is

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,060
SEO because it's not some kind of magic

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,380
I don't have to get a wand or go to you

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,579
know if for those people that are Harry

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,799
Potter fans I don't have to go to

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,829
Hogwarts to learn this all right and

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,109
it's not magic it's simply some simple

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,570
logic and what helps us understand what

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:02,940
is SEO is why do we have SEO in the

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,760
first place let's think about this why

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,859
do we have SEO you see because it really

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
comes down to this search engines want

00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,870
to deliver a great experience so in

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,150
Australia we have a term do we have any

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,890
Aziz here I know we do have a few all

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,180
right so for the odds is in the audience

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,890
you all know this phrase when we're at a

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,880
barbecue and nobody knows the answer

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:26,260
what do we say Google Ads that's correct

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,880
in Google we trust

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,500
alright there's no longer in god we

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,050
trust' in google we trust and we all

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,980
assume google gives us the correct

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,110
result don't we

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,410
anybody assume when they do a Google

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,600
search that's wrong no but we all share

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,500
what's right and what we have to

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,030
remember is Google when you they send

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,600
someone to your web page they're

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:53,680
referring someone of their trust to your

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,480
website it's a referral isn't it they

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,540
refer somebody over it's a business

00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,670
relationship of a referral so at the end

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,140
of the day Google senses their customers

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:08,050
for free when we do SEO correctly so how

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,510
can we refer somebody I have to trust

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,060
them don't I you don't refer people of

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,160
things you don't trust so I've got a

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,410
spammy looking website Google doesn't

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,730
trust me because my websites crap right

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,930
so they're not going to refer so at the

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,040
end of the day SEO is the ability of

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,070
communicating how trustworthy your

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,410
website is with Google and they tell us

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,050
in some cases what we need to do all

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,420
right that's what SEO is is earning

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,520
trust with a search engine so you can

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,760
get that traffic and how the search

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,180
engines understand if they can trust you

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,490
what do they do

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,340
they use these things called algorithms

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,660
so for those of you who don't know

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,720
Google has these things called robots

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,970
spiders or crawlers take your pick right

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,290
but basically Google goes around the

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,530
internet looking at all the different

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,470
pages it grabs your page and sends it

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,720
back to their data center and in that

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,780
data center they run algorithms over

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,750
this index of data and to understand

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,100
that data they use algorithms the first

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,470
one was that famous one where they

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,990
looked at links the founders of Google

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,820
were in a library one day looking at

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,080
white papers and I said how do we know

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,300
which ones worth reading

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,290
I said well surely it's the one that's

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,890
been cited by other leading thinkers the

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,380
most hey what happens if we did the same

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,420
sort of thing with webpages and they

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,920
started to count links and say hey the

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,690
number of links you have to a web page

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,889
if a lot of people are linking to a page

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,469
that must be an indicator that this

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:44,060
age is good and that's really the birth

00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,699
of the first algorithm that was called

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,990
the PageRank now since that time they've

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,490
come up with all sorts of other

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:55,039
algorithms panda that was a doozy of a

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,810
update that one they'll detect a

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,080
duplicate content a lot of people in

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,969
WordPress got hit by this one up here

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,779
because we end up with duplicate content

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:07,969
in WordPress how will your category

00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,909
pages tag pages things like that

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:13,039
everyone gets tagged heavy anyone got

00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:15,439
any tag happy customers that use there

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,779
yep you know what I mean all right they

00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,430
put hash tag this hash tag that they

00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,039
think they're on Twitter and you have to

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,650
say no you're on your website you don't

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:27,409
need five variations of the same tag you

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,449
just created five pages with links to

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,039
this stuff that's triplicate content

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,620
right penguin

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,900
well that detected fake or duplicate

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,379
links or links worth noting there's no

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,050
point

00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:42,169
linking to your butchers website from

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,689
plumbers are us it doesn't cut up does

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,599
it think about it why would a plumber be

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,310
linking to a butcher another make a lot

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,219
of sense I guess maybe did the plumbing

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,289
at the butchers but you see what I mean

00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,669
like there's a lot of sense there so

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,839
that's what this one does hummingbird

00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,360
was another one that helped people

00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,120
understand intent a great example of

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,710
intent yesterday me and my wife were

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,939
walking around the wonderful baby we

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,229
went up to see those Gardens I don't

00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,180
know if anyone's seen the gardens up

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,529
here they're beautiful I'd encourage you

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,500
to go take a look if you haven't seen it

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:15,620
yet and on the way back we said hey

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,740
let's get a Starbucks coffee so I said

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,589
Starbucks now because of the intent of

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,159
the search Google gave me directions to

00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:27,069
Starbucks it didn't give me two thousand

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,300
word essay on Starbucks on the founders

00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,560
didn't tell me about where they source

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,719
their beans from or anything like that

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,329
they it knows from intent that was

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,740
hummingbird and pigeon was another one

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:39,890
that helped with local search as well

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,360
okay and then we had mobilegeddon that

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,909
was a while ago but that basically means

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,890
if your website doesn't work on mobile

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,649
we don't like you anymore all right

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,750
that's what Google said and Fred just so

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,390
you know every algorithm update recently

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,810
is called Fred we've got Sookie given

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,730
unknown

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,020
they all called Fred down alright so if

00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,640
you ever go to an agency and they say I

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,010
was a threat update it could be any

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,860
update that happened this year because

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,100
algorithms are now updating around 18 to

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,480
20 times a day the algorithms change

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,330
that often with Google now they're

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,980
machine learning algorithms so that's

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,080
why it's important that we understand

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,330
this why because let's go back to our

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,660
original premise what's important there

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:23,120
best result for the search engine right

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,580
search engines want to send people to

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,740
the best possible page for whatever they

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,279
search for that's what Google's trying

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,750
to do and we need to work with Google if

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,390
we're going to get SEO results for our

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,710
business we need to work with Google to

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,600
prove that we have their best result we

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,270
have to prove it and how do we do that

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,250
by creating awesome webpages

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,529
and I want to go through that today what

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,000
does it actually take okay to make that

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:52,220
great page but that's what we're doing

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,810
here so less and less are we thinking

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,670
about manipulating some sort of

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,950
algorithm and we're actually thinking

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,650
what's the best page how do I make sure

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,220
that I'm giving my potential clients the

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:10,010
best possible experience that's what SEO

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:13,210
is really all about so what does an SEO

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,000
tech do what would you say you do here

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,190
all right so what we do is we check your

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,570
website against the algorithms and

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,880
guides there's all sorts of guides out

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,650
there if you go onto my website there'll

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,390
be links to some various things as we go

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,720
through but we basically look at your

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,430
website and we say what's broken what

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,930
doesn't go with the algorithms what's

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,300
Google telling us that we need to fix

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,850
they can be things like you've got no

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,370
alt text on any of your images you've

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,339
got long sentences that are boring

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,580
you've got broken links you've got

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:49,310
duplicate pages you've got images that

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,740
are broken you've got missing titles and

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,860
descriptions on your page all this kind

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,839
of stuff that needs to be fixed and the

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,690
higher quality we get the better quality

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,910
Google will pick up on your site pretty

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,370
simple if you think about it isn't it so

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,260
we fix those errors and recommendations

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,550
that are coming from search engines and

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,010
there's great tools that help us

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,950
do that so what is SEO it's making the

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:16,160
best webpage for a given search term to

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,570
maximize referral traffic that's what it

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
is

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,310
it's nothing else forget all the other

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,040
stuff it's making the best webpage for a

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,990
given search term and one thing I want

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,110
to say really clearly is do not

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,570
manipulate the algorithms don't try to

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,310
manipulate it what do you hope to gain

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,380
you're only gonna get traffic from

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,839
Google where people don't look at your

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,790
page and leave anyway if you don't have

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,769
the right to be the first page don't

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,180
expect it you've got to earn that

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,610
referral okay

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,130
earn the referral make sure your page is

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,600
actually worth linking to and you'll

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,980
find that people will actually link to

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,560
it okay pretty simple so what makes the

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,620
best page for SEO what makes the best

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,390
page what actually you have to have you

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,640
know 60% of your effort we've found

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,860
should go into your content you can have

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,350
everything else done great and we've had

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,300
clients like this mind you all right

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,490
they have everything else done great I

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,430
know because we managed it we have the

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,110
top level scores on SEMRush and top

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,990
scores on all the different tools that

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,850
crawl the pages fast loading times of

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,860
less than three seconds on first load

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,170
under a second and a half a second load

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,240
we're talking a really great site good

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,760
mobile experience but they content

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:36,829
stinks it stinks and they can't really

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,230
get over 10,000 unique users a month

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:42,470
they're struggling to get over 25,000

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,610
30,000 page views a month because people

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,890
and they don't get repeat visitors

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,180
because their content stinks okay

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,399
so you've got to make sure you get the

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,380
content done first it should be mobile

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,060
friendly it should be fast the other

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,220
stuff is technical off sites things like

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,399
links you know you need people linking

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,540
to your content so it's kept going you

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,300
know because you got to think about it

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,709
you just can't get top spot without that

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,310
content it's not gonna happen

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:08,959
all right it ain't gonna happen so let's

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,660
think about this you need to have great

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,550
content so great content is always your

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,010
starting point every other element of

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:19,279
SEO can't match it okay it cannot match

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,160
it you need that great starting point of

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,140
great

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,540
so what is good content then you know so

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,550
we know why we have SEO we know the

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,020
parts of SEO but but what is this good

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,660
content what does that look like what

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,310
makes a great page and what tools can I

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,610
use to get started with making this

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,290
content what could actually use so I've

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,029
made this very simple checklist here

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,370
these are the four key things that I

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,950
always look at first of all your page

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,080
has to answer what potential clients are

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,520
searching for you could optimize for

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,980
something that no one's searching for it

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,020
won't get you a result

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,690
okay so branded terms you should

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,250
optimize for them of course but there's

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,130
no point what what's one of your latest

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:04,240
products Ricky from WP engine a name of

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:07,690
a product smart plug-in manager right

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,450
so Ricky works with WP engine a classy

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,010
WordPress hosting outfit out of Austin

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,200
Texas and they come up with smart

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,089
plug-in manager but let's think about

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,910
that is someone going to be searching

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,600
this apart plug-in manager or might they

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,890
might they're really really out

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,140
searching for something else aren't they

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,120
so you could optimize for smart plug-in

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,070
manager but the problem you're solving

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,450
that's not actually displayed in the

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,150
name of the product so you could rank

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,070
number one for smart plug-in manager but

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,500
what your users are searching for won't

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,050
be there so your page needs to be

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,880
comprehensive and easy to read does

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,740
anybody ever get to a page and go these

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,790
sentences are just too short and easy to

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,200
understand nobody didn't think so all

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,990
right you should have images and video

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,300
to help communicate and a great title

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,730
and introduction so let's think about

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,520
that page so Ricky's there with smart

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,200
plug-in manager and he can go to Google

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,910
and start to type in something and you

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,839
get an auto suggest and everyone knows

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,860
what I'm talking about they're

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,620
autosuggest

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,230
right you type something out what else

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,990
it just starts to fill out and these are

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,180
what we call key phrases now it only

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,830
gets there is someone search for it if

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,290
nobody's searched for it doesn't come in

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,120
the list okay that's the only way it

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,490
gets there and this is what we call

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,620
keyword research anybody heard the term

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,810
keyword research this is what it is

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,030
all right yeah if you've heard of it

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,709
this is what it is and you know what

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,900
it's a deep hole of stuff you can go

00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,649
into for a long time I always start with

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,869
this

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,939
and then from these ones I look at the

00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:38,709
suggestions in Google and then I go to

00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:40,869
the other types of tools when I need to

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:43,869
refine that further now for those

00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:47,110
playing at home who went to mr k WP comm

00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:49,629

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:01,179
to further enhance your search keyword

00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,679
research stuff okay so if you want to do

00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:06,129
keyword research I encourage you to

00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:08,980
check that one out so let's go on now so

00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:11,790
I've got my keyword research now I need

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,199
to actually make a great page right and

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,470
wonderful thing is there's tools to do

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,170
that

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,790
and in WordPress they're free tools who

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,470
would have thought that WordPress had a

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,670
plugin for that that's right

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,860
it's got a plug-in for pretty much

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,019
everything doesn't it one of the ones

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,050
that I really love right now is the SEM

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:31,300
rush writing tool man I'm hooked on this

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,009
thing it's great you put your research

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,600
into it and it tells you everything you

00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:36,069
need to do to write your content out it

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,529
even tells you other words to put in

00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:40,889
your content tells you how easy it is to

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:43,420
read all that kind of stuff

00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:46,629
and of course for those playing at home

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,069
on mo k WP com

00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,660
you'll be able to add some links to some

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,459
great tools about what you need to do

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,339
here but let's just think about this

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,959
make sure that you put headings in all

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,540
right nobody likes to see a big block of

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,149
text with no paragraphs and subheadings

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,449
make sure you do it no more than 250

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,959
words between subheadings please all

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,909
right

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,010
nobody likes some longer than that keep

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:11,230
your sentences as short as you can use

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,990
active voice and make sure that you

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,610
write to a lower grade level okay you

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,470
can still have some sophisticated

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,390
sentences but try and keep it simple

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,579
everyone likes reading simple things

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,199
that's why people bought the Harry

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,600
Potter book the original Harry Potter

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,549
book actually printed adult covers on it

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,830
so adults could read it even though it

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,510
was made for primary school-aged kids

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,700
because everyone enjoyed the story okay

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,029
it was a really good thing to do it

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,500
we've lost four lights we're in the dark

00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,820
all right we better talk about

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,889
structured data in the all right that's

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,139
a bit of a dark space on the web okay

00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:45,669
but some look once you've got that

00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,929
content it's important to put some

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,059
images and video

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,409
and if you can do structure data this is

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,019
one of these little gold mines I'm

00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:55,779
finding lately and this here is what you

00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,369
see with structured data so see here how

00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:00,009
we've got like this FAQ under the

00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:03,460
content here that's done with structured

00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:06,129
data one of my plugins is for the DB

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,190
theme and it makes this structured data

00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:10,809
going to your FAQ people have frequently

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,950
asked questions if you think about it

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,440
everything that somebody asks on

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,619
Google's a question it's a good idea to

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,450
have an FAQ on your important landing

00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:21,220
pages and when you put it in in

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,759
structured data it's nice a little card

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,080
here on your information now obviously

00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,729
if you can put a video on your page as

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,070
well hey that's awesome

00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:32,499
but relevant content please guys there's

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,320
no point putting cats playing piano on

00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:37,779
your plumbers website the gif Matlock

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,720
might look real cool right with that cat

00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,619
with its arms out playing piano

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,700
but it doesn't relate to the content

00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,529
okay

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,529
and don't go stealing other people's

00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:49,989
images all right get original content

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:52,599
where you can get your smartphone out

00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:55,090
and take a photo and put it in your

00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,739
webpage it's not rocket science but you

00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,739
know what it makes a difference relevant

00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:03,070
photos relevant images to your content

00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:04,479
helped a lot okay so we've got all that

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,039
stuff in there and of course we have to

00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:08,320
think about our title and introduction

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,509
now let me ask you a question here who

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,059
would say this is a correct statement

00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:15,039
your membership journey starts when they

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:20,649
land on your web page he reckons that's

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:23,109
true anybody nobody it's a bit of a

00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:24,759
trick question because the journey

00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:26,889
doesn't start there if you think about

00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,139
it the journey starts in Google when

00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:33,279
they read the title and description of

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:36,309
the text on your search link and that's

00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,639
called a meta title and description okay

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,349
now Yoast has a great free tool this is

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:42,729
the example of it used been used on

00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,169
Gutenberg you can see here that we've

00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:46,269
got the Meta Description being filled

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,359
out this is the words there that's your

00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,349
ad that's your free advert on Google

00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,690
where they're going to refer people

00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,989
through don't skimp on your titles and

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,389
descriptions because that's your advert

00:19:54,989 --> 00:20:00,070
alright and you think about it just by

00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:00,520
changing this I did a test on one of our

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,550
PO

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,640
and I went from 800 unique views a month

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,470
to two and a half thousand just by

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,679
updating the title and description to

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,440
better describe what a page was about

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:17,340
that's all I did nothing else that's a

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:21,250
lot e that's not pageviews that's users

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:25,090
all right that's really cool two and a

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,110
half thousand a month on one page think

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,760
about what that would cost you with

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,650
AdWords at a dollar a click you're

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,500
already at two and a half grand for

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,780
fixing one title and Meta Description

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,600
and for those playing at home I'm okay

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,420
WUP on the blog you can actually click

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,010
through to some information about that

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,320
so what have we got here you're going to

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,600
craft this great content let's remember

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,760
this your page has to answer what

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,230
potential clients are searching for your

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,960
page needs to be comprehensive and easy

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,300
to read and people need to understand it

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,710
it should have images and video and it

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,270
needs to have a great title and

00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,650
information with that meta description

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,080
so that people can actually click it

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,720
remember that's your ad that's your free

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,710
ad in the search results in Google get

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,770
it nailed so I've got this great page

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:16,240
but everyone needs speed right you need

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:17,950
it to be fast nobody ever said hey this

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,600
page loads too fast I don't know if I

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,700
trust it it's like hey man I went to

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,720
your place your Internet's just too fast

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm not downloading anything no nobody

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,750
ever said that right because everyone

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,740
loves fast pages so let's give them what

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,240
they want fast fast fast fast and that

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,640
means I'll see a lot of people were

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,070
using GT metrics you guys familiar with

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,410
GT metrics people know that tool I love

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,720
it it's a fantastic tool but one of the

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:51,730
big issues is people focus on these two

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,790
things my websites got an A+ I've got a

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:57,490
yslow score of you know what that's that

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,860
doesn't matter it doesn't matter because

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,570
you know what does your client you know

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,250
it's definitely up the back there for

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,320
the trade is none of her trade he is

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:10,320
going to go on to Steph's website and

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,320
say oh it's only a rated PageSpeed score

00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:17,820
although it's not gonna happen they care

00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:20,730
about these other schools here how long

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,450
did it take to load total time that's

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,960
what matters

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,090
how BIG's the page you know if I give

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,890
people a 22 megabyte background video

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,500
just to fill my header up with some nice

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,779
moving clouds that's not a good idea to

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,850
get this page speed down is it right

00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:37,710
total times what really matters that's

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,419
what people really care about so don't

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,000
get caught up with these scores it's a

00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,220
vanity metric what matters is the time

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,409
and I found this out when I was testing

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,260
one of our websites I got my score to

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:53,640
increase but my time went longer because

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,200
I was using SSL with HTTP two that meant

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,659
that I can download lots of little small

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,850
files instead of one big file or same

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,260
time and it made my page go faster

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,820
instead of combining it together and

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,070
getting one PageSpeed score up and

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,929
that's when I realized I was chasing the

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,809
wrong thing I don't have to chase the

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,460
score I need to chase a good time so for

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:13,350
those people that really want to get

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,260
good results aim for less than three

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:21,179
seconds for your first page load less

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,590
than three okay so of course there's a

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,539
whole bunch of tools they can help you

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,520
do this GT metrics a lighthouse

00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,710
lighthouse is a new tool from Google and

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,899
installs in Chrome use it follow the

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,990
recommendations it's becoming a bigger

00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,789
and bigger thing I use WP rocket as a

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,860
plugin just to generally give me a lot

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,049
of real kick on my site to get me a long

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,880
way forward to my page speed it is

00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:45,179
premium but I think it's worth it

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,830
next WP smush there is a free and a

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,260
premium version of this this optimizes

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,110
your images all right so you don't end

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,149
up loading like a 500 kilobyte image

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,860
when 50 will do okay

00:23:54,149 --> 00:24:00,809
strip them down keep them small next up

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,370
we've got one of the most important ones

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,789
of all and let's use a high quality host

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:07,470
I love Kim stuff sorry Ricky

00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:08,940
WP engine is cool too but I've been with

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,970
kids too for a while I've found them to

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,860
be great I can solidly recommend them I

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,740
think they're fantastic but the thing is

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:19,649
there's no point being on a bad host and

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,580
getting slow times off that host or

00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,710
irregular down time and start

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,360
and expecting you only get good results

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,910
so spend the extra ten or twenty dollars

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,320
on a premium WordPress host and at the

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,110
end of the day they're the ones who

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,210
support events like this so look at the

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,580
sponsors here they're good examples of

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,350
good hosts you at your site grounds WP

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,240
engines your kin stirs go with those

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,790
sorts of guys because they know

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,520
WordPress that's the point they'll make

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,860
it fast so we've got it all gone fast I

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,060
put my awesome content in there now I

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,760
need to make sure I measure for the

00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,740
results what you don't measure you don't

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,450
really know how all right and we always

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,580
have analytics over assumptions

00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,710
assumptions is what gets us in trouble

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,390
oh my customers don't really want simple

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,610
text to read I've actually heard that

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,160
from a lot of my customers they don't

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,820
really want that how do they know have

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,370
you asked him

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,650
do they even read your meaningless

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,540
drivel I don't actually say that to the

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,420
client so don't don't repeat that bit

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,190
that's our look make sure it's easy to

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,440
read okay so we want to make sure we've

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:23,050
got these ways of measuring things and

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,750
you probably already know them use

00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,610
google analytics and when I say use I

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,920
don't mean put that snippet of code on

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,130
your page and forget about it I mean use

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,350
it put the app on your phone read the

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,390
starts people all right

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,340
it's got artificial intelligence that it

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,620
will even tell you what you need to know

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,380
but use it all right

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,360
Google tag manager Google didn't invent

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,450
this just for the sake of it it's

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,820
actually got a real purpose use it use

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,680
it I'll write a recent blog post on my

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,080
website about do you need a plugin for

00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,690
this do you need a plug-in for Google

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,090
Analytics do you need a plugin for your

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,950
Facebook pixel tracker the answer is no

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,320
I personally don't recommend you use

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,120
plugins for this stuff really because

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,390
you should know how this works because

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,700
tracking is important okay use google

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,490
webmaster console yep that means don't

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,770
just submit your sitemap actually use it

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,820
open it up look at the information it's

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,010
giving you okay

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,710
and finally I use of the rank tracker

00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:26,110
with semrush so once you've done 1 2 & 3

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,220
if you haven't done 1 2 & 3 don't look

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:33,160
for a rank tracker ok do 1 2 1 3 first

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,430
then look for the rank tracker all right

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,350
rank trackers basically you

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,670
put some details in there and it tells

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,980
you where your ranking against your

00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,930
competition for certain keywords so you

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,640
can track it again what you don't track

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,980
you don't know you don't understand what

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,780
you're really going with so I'm tracking

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,210
everything this is all going good but

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,570
what about social media what can I do

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,250
with social media to help my SEO and

00:26:53,570 --> 00:27:00,440
what I found is there's one particular

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:04,170
social media platform that loves links

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,140
all the tweeters out there looking at

00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,000
you Twitter loves links what do I mean

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,140
by that Twitter will actually share to

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,060
let you share traffic in links you can

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,340
put your link on Twitter and actually

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,890
show it to people half the time you put

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,960
a link on Facebook to your YouTube video

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,080
and all of a sudden that kind of just

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,720
disappears where'd that go

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,820
well hey who would have thought that

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,320
Facebook doesn't want people to leave

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:36,300
Facebook true isn't it you think about

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,510
it Facebook's model is showing people

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,420
adverts they do not want businesses to

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,370
be sharing links without paying because

00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,230
people leave Facebook and that stops

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,880
them making money off them because the

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,730
more adverts Facebook shows the more

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,440
money they make so when you don't just

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,590
ignore sharing your links but just know

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,240
Twitter loves links and that means you

00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,180
can share this great content you've

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,610
crafted multiple times some of my pages

00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,730
I put them in an auto sharer I use Ojo

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:07,530
social or deliver it other people use

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,660
HootSuite and that kind of stuff right

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,870
and you put your link in there and you

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,540
say share this every month I just kept

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,490
sharing it because how long is content

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,310
lifetime on social media how long does

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,100
it live there for a couple of days a

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,420
week baby you see I see a lot of people

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,820
putting all this effort into making

00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,120
Facebook posts and Twitter posts and

00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,920
Instagram images but after a week no one

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,930
looks at them anymore there's anybody

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,180
ever here had a link to it has somebody

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,970
like an image older than like a week or

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:42,240
two on Instagram it happens sometimes

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:44,130
right yeah yeah Facebook but how often

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
does it happen what maybe one in a

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,140
hundred

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,490
not without boosting you're not paying

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,870
for ads or anything like somebody

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,340
actually finds content you

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,830
posted a year ago and just randomly

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,720
likes it if they did that you think that

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,090
a stalker what's going on here you know

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,700
why someone liking something I posted

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,059
two years ago but the thing is you can

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,470
have a blog post an update at once every

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,750
two years just give it a little bit of

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,910
improvement you know on something really

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,130
important for your industry and it'll

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,890
get you traffic every single day of the

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,990
week from Google over and over and over

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,330
and it will still be relevant for those

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,240
people searching for it's not going to

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:23,670
change that's the power of your content

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,679
lifetime so use automation tools to

00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,170
share that piece of great content you

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
spend all the effort building and make

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,030
sure that people get it shared to them

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,590
on Twitter because you know if I show

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,150
you something today like structured data

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,679
somebody might not have used structured

00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,809
data before it's new to them today I've

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,570
been using it for two years but it's new

00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,980
for someone today right and that same

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,070
information I learned before is still

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,590
relevant today so why should we not do

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,360
that so use those automation tools you

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,160
create that great content share it again

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,350
and again and again use Google my

00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,970
business forward as well if anyone is

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,950
aware of Google my business you have the

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,280
posts in there they get a heap of

00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,710
traffic for nothing make sure you use it

00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,540
what's really really well all right so

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,360
WordPress in SEO where do we actually

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,340
start you've seen all this today what

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,710
are you going to do to get started what

00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,320
do you actually have to do and these are

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,590
some simple steps first of all start

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,520
with WordPress up here start with

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,740
WordPress WordPress actually out of all

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,620
the tests I've seen gives you more of a

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,540
result than anything else out of the box

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,760
it's it's really quite a great CMS it's

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,390
such a wonderful piece of software okay

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:39,809
second up let's make sure we get a fast

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,490
host okay if you don't have these two

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,030
things sorted then the rest of my advice

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:47,790
is probably a little bit next up use a

00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,640
mobile optimized theme now I've been a

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,960
fan of Divi for a long time but I've

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,550
been starting to use asked for a lot

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,309
particularly since Gutenberg's come out

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:59,040
and the reason is simply there's the

00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:02,400
pages are lighter all right each page

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,650
has less code so let's think about why

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,270
this

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,680
is important Google has a set amount of

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,390
resources don't know they've got data

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,180
centers and they're sucking all these

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,800
pages in now if they've got a budget of

00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,440
how much processing power they're going

00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,880
to give my website and all my pages are

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,760
half the size they're going to get

00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,190
through twice as much content on the

00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,440
same amount of processing power you get

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,970
what I mean because the pages are

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,650
smaller they're lighter they're leaner

00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,510
and not only is that better for my own

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,080
customer because the page loads faster

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,790
but at the same time Google likes it too

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,740
so look for something that's lean I like

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,610
a straw it's a good place to start if

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,140
you can get something that's amp

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,430
compatible I think amp is worth

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,650
exploring

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,140
take a look at that accelerated mobile

00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:48,040
pages we're talking about install Yoast

00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,780
that's free greatness CEO tool I would

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,570
encourage you to use SEM rush that's

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,120
free as well and of course once you've

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,920
got these tools set up fill your website

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,060
with great content using the tips I've

00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,390
got today and you'll be well on your way

00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:05,020
to getting great traffic and look that's

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:08,380
it that's how you do it all right so

00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,040
remember focus on content and ask me

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,840
some questions

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,470
the only bad question is the one that's

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,470
never asked

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:50,660
right that's right yep yes yeah the

00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,400
domain name extensions have no impact on

00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,290
where you're ranking what matters is

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,570
your citation and making sure your

00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,640
address details are correct so that

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,980
means there's a listing management tool

00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,660
that you can use in SEMRush but you look

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,870
at where your domain name is and where

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,460
that business is mapped to all right

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,950
and within that you'll be able to see

00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,130
hey Google knows that I'm in this area

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,510
Google knows I'm servicing this region

00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:17,400
so that's what matters your content

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,950
again and doing the right structured

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,370
data that's what will determine that

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:28,820
Google knows are in the right local area

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:28,820
you're welcome down the front

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:42,549
drunky to rename the Cheryl yes yes it

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,500
will

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,570
anything you do to improve your content

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,000
can improve ranking when it comes to

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:52,179
images specifically I'm not having

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,360
something like DSC double O one JPEG

00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:58,539
it's better to have Matt and Kate at the

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,210
zoo jpg and then have the alt tag saying

00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,570
Matt and Kate at Singapore Zoo you get

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,169
what I mean

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,179
so describing as best you can if you

00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:09,010
think about it if you can look at

00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,970
something and not know what it is from

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:15,159
any form in a machine then you're better

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:18,669
off relabeling that to make it so it's

00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:24,460
comprehensible so names with hyphens for

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:28,020
your image names is best okay yeah we've

00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,020
got a couple up the back there Ricky

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:40,470
hi Matt hey that was good at site that

00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,120
Facebook I mean it's it's obvious now

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:45,300
but it was a good reminder that Facebook

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:49,370
does not like links out of Facebook why

00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,720
did you say that Twitter likes links

00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:53,520
Twitter's becoming one of the big search

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,020
engines so let's think about what

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,370
Twitter is the number one in right now

00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,080
they're number one in news that's now so

00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:04,440
nobody ever says we're trending on

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,600
Facebook right nobody ever says we're

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,650
trending on YouTube they say we're

00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,170
trending on Twitter because Twitter

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,900
Twitter is about now information and

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,570
Twitter is used to share links by news

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,700
sites that's their bread and butter so

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,680
sharing links in Twitter what I've found

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,820
if I share the same link in Facebook and

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,100
Twitter with the same audience

00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,630
I get more views in Twitter instantly

00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,670
for the same content when everything

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,160
else is considered the same because

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,870
Twitter actually wants you to use them

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,090
as a kind of search engine for what's

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:36,450
happening right now that's what they

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,730
want that's what their speciality is so

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,410
for them you find in content and using

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,150
it as a search engine and going to the

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,650
link is the same benefit that Google has

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,670
they're helping you answer a question

00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:49,670
about right now okay

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,670
welcome

00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,430
question if they ask something that you

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,350
mentioned whether confident isn't good

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:12,420
yes a lot of times I understand that you

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:14,430
have to buy good content you've spoken

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,740
to anyone who's built their own website

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,770
they all imagine that they have the best

00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,040
content sure well all I can tell you is

00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,570
the stats prove it that's when you say

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,330
let's look at the analytics because

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,950
Google didn't come up with this because

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,050
it's going to hurt their users did they

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,840
let's think about this for a second does

00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:37,500
Google want to send people to anything

00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,560
that's not proven no they keep the

00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,360
analytics they've got some of the best

00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,780
AI learning tools they built tensorflow

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,580
they're using mark of AI algorithms and

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,990
all these different wonderful technology

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:54,180
things with one purpose help us as

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,300
Google understand how to deliver the

00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,430
absolute best result to search so when

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,050
somebody says hey know my contents

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,260
better than what Google says they're

00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,220
actually saying I'm smarter than Google

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,620
you know what I mean like to take it to

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,150
that level now it doesn't necessarily

00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,160
mean that Google always knows better

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,130
with every audience you can have things

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,750
that are more formal or less formal in

00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,600
the way that you communicate things and

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,310
there's also things like trust for

00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,700
example Google will look at things like

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:27,630
hey this guy's Matt Nitin he's writing

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,980
about a torn calf muscle and what he did

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,510
to recover it we're not sending anybody

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,220
there because he's not even a doctor he

00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,080
talks about SEO for goodness sakes

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,870
right because there's level of trust

00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,430
there so there is that factor to

00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:40,290
consider and Google does factor that

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,480
stuff in they have a term called your

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,820
money or your life and anything that's

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,580
in your money or your life things like

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,560
legal advice stuff on divorce things

00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,900
about medical journals all that kind of

00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,940
stuff have a slightly different

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,130
algorithm apply to them about the way

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,860
those businesses communicate because

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,500
it's different right reading a medical

00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,200
journal is a heck of a lot different

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,540
than reading something about my steps to

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,620
do a kickflip on a skateboard right and

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,620
the audience is different

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,920
that you have with your clients and they

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,690
generally involve an industry they do as

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,760
a matter of fact the SEMRush tool does

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,800
apply those industry specific things in

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,390
the writing tool so if you put those

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,130
types of keywords in there it will

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,339
automatically say we encourage you to be

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,200
more formal or more casual we suggest

00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,089
you to write slightly longer sentences

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,059
for this and your content should be

00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:37,430
2,000 words not 1,000 because of the

00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:57,109
type of thing that you're targeting yeah

00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:58,490
so it does take that into account and

00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,589
grab me if you want to ask anything is

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,520
well afterwards on I'm big but I'm

00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,520
approachable all right

00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:11,519
