um one thing I always like to mention is

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:10,290
that I have never unpacked a wordpress

00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,690
thing in my life so you can run a

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,839
business and not really know how to

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,460
develop WordPress it's almost like it's

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,770
better because you have to hire straight

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,240
away so I always like to lead with that

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,410
all right so first things first let's

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,269
stand up up up up up up all right so you

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,949
all just had lunch right and you're

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,810
probably like really full in the stomach

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,340
and you're like I way too much out there

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,079
because it looks really really good

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,149
so I just want you to like shake it up

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,670
and get the blood going anywhere else

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,149
but your stomach yeah are you feeling

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,390
better

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,460
all right you can relax that's that is

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,680
the participation that I wanted thank

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,110
you

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,050
all right so running a business can be

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,680
like riding big waves so I'm obviously

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,170
from Sydney I love surfing I would not

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,809
attempt anything of that size I do

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,910
little baby waves but this is what

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,880
running a business or lead generation

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,400
can be like at one point you're at the

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
top of the wave and you're just chilling

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
and sitting then you can see exactly

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,530
where you're going to go and the next

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,110
minute you get completely wiped out you

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,159
like god damn it it's not working the

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,860
business sucks

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,790
now most businesses that are sitting at

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,390
the bottom of that pipe sort of relying

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,030
on word of mouth now I don't know if you

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,070
say this in your business speak or if

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,500
you've got friends that say this but oh

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,049
my god how do you get your clients where

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,380
to mouth oh I've got I've got the best

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,200
word-of-mouth business I'm referral

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,899
based well I got to tell you sitting in

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,479
the back of the business that's what

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,079
referral marketing and word-of-mouth

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,000
marketing does you have no idea where

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,070
the next lead is actually coming from

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
because you're sitting back and you're

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,930
waiting for it to come to you you can't

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,259
just simply turn on let's say Facebook

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,719
ads and go hey referrals come at me that

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,700
just that's just not going to work um so

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,489
you want to actually put a system in

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,720
place so that you can turn leads on at

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,080
any point so that if you do

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,350
some old age you can go and get it

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,260
earlier

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:25,420
all right sweet big car fan I want to

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,060
give you the power and I'm going to show

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,520
you in four simple steps how easy it is

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,050
to actually turn your business on its

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,090
head and actually start generating some

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:40,360
leads for yourself now this is a typical

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,120
day you might start at 9:00 to 5:00 and

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,430
there's like eight hours in every single

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,220
day and you might be answering emails

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,740
checking project management talking to

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,170
one of your lady bosses talking to your

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,600
developer I don't know going to lunch

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,670
having a coffee like I don't know what

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,250
your typical day looks like but in the

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,020
end it's you know if you're doing twenty

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,750
thousand things it's going to start

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,270
looking like this and you're really

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,180
spread thin think about if you were

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,970
applying for the Olympics and you are

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,470
going to be you know you wanted the gold

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,350
medal first sprinting

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,660
so in between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. if you

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,330
trained for the 100-meter sprint and

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,580
then you stopped it you know 9:00 and

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,190
then it from nine to ten you then did

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,770
marathon training and then from 10 to 11

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,140
you did some high jump training and then

00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,940
at eleven to twelve will actually you

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,200
spanned it out to one because you got

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,480
long jump you're not very good at it

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,480
that might be how you're running your

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,510
business right now every single hour is

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,390
a very different thing if we actually

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:52,780
just did ding one thing we'd all be gold

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:56,010
medalists yeah hands up who's running

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,970
their business like the preview

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,400
almost sore head

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,980
Hey I love the honesty in the room yeah

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,320
I was definitely here doing all of this

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,250
a hundred percent I mean I was doing

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,780
logo design in design design sheets I

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,420
was doing some WordPress work I was

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:18,040
doing some Magento work we were doing

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,989
some a tiny bit of joomla work i mean a

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,620
little bit of hosting we'll make an 8

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,810
bucks you know and no wonder i wasn't

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,720
profitable but then when i got

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,530
really simple and just did one thing and

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:38,190
offered one thing and everything got

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:43,660
much easier okay I know bless you

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,370
alright so I googled web designer Sydney

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,770
right and this is the first guy that

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,340
came up so I'm really sorry Jimmy Webb

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:55,450

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,880
this chat so Jimmy Webb website I don't

00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,490
know what your website looks like but

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,910
this one is a typical one that I see

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,760
from my coaching clients so homepage

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,150
about page services page I've popped

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,870
over that services page tab and then

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,870
whoa I was met with a whopping mega menu

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,010
of all the things that this gentleman

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:25,030
all-female Jimmy could be both sexes

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,460
he's doing here so as a customer you've

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,830
just put in web designer Sidney let's

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,330
say and you've got to this guy's site

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,840
now he's paying good money on SEO

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,020
because he was like first and then you

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,930
get to the website and there's like well

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,870
we do design we do travel design fashion

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,180
design handbags jewelry do you want to

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,120
set a steak knives on development

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,880
ecommerce hosting marketing can you see

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,789
how cloudy the customer is going to be

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,870
when they come here they're not going to

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,270
know what to do

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,400
all they know is that someone said

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,979
either oh you don't have a website you

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,320
should get one or our website sucks

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,190
you should go fix that and so they're

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,770
going to come here and just be

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,970
completely confused now I click it's

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,820
over here um good example is a tradies

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,380
niche that i run and basically there is

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,650
nothing else you can do on this website

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,260
except go to the prime service page

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,570
which is the trade e accelerate system

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,700
that is it and its second it's the most

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,780
important thing on the page after the

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,910
homepage because that's got the

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,030
downloadable free bait thing that gets

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,880
that generates leads but this is it like

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,499
this is my services page so when a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,949
trades person now what's the traits for

00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:46,189
a tradie in Australian slang is like an

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,379
electrician a plumber carpenter you know

00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:50,719
that kind of thing yeah so when a trades

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,430
person comes to the home page

00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,680
they might download the free thing or

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,650
they'll end up on the many calls to

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,979
action to get to this page then they'll

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:04,370
just see our one offer we've got one

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,249
offer that pulls them in and targets

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,590
them and talks to them specifically for

00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:12,259
their biggest problem and we're talking

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,879
about the solution so we're saying even

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,439
in the speech here like you know

00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,050
attention traders were ready to be the

00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,310
superhero of their local community

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,770
dominate your local area with the

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,919
trainee accelerate system oh what is

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,960
that no one else can sell the traders

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:33,110
accelerate system can they because I

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,110
made it up so just doing this has

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,060
completely simplified everything that we

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,669
do in the business and now when those

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,969
leads come to this site they get

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,949
funneled straight to our core offer now

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,150
there's only two things that we do in

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,830
this business either the trainee

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,120
accelerate system or a quick start

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,180
system everything is a good a name

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,279
because that's marketing can you imagine

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,689
working with these guys like what do

00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,759
they do like think of your own site what

00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,729
is your webs do you have one of those

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,849
services pages that have like web design

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:14,659
or web development and WordPress it's

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:17,569
too much so it's too much he was number

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,250
one so yeah he's SEO he's very good

00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,509
obviously and he would get calls of

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,180
course he's first there's like a

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,399
thousand people such a wordpress you

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,439
know designer Sydney etc so he would get

00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,409
good leads but imagine if he simplified

00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,409
his offer most customers have no idea

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,539
what they want they want you to tell

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,320
them what to do and if you show them

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,260
array of all this stuff they're gonna

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,820
get real cloudy and take a step back and

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,070
take a breathing because this is tech

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,899
they've got no idea what this stuff is

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,720
and they're just looking for someone to

00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,860
lead them to the path where they can get

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,910
a solution okay

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:59,590
so in all of this I want you to stay

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:03,230
solution focused yeah let's keep moving

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,660
all right three reasons why most

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,440
marketers don't need so lead generation

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,710
the best way to speed up lead generation

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,860
is to actually pick a niche and to stick

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,300
to it and stick with it now why do

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,770
people not think to stick to a niche one

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,740
they feel like they're going to lose an

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,990
opportunity like oh I can't just work

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,760
with photographers because there's not

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,230
enough photographers in this world for

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,500
me and I'm never going to run a

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,990
profitable business or you know I don't

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,690
think that I've got an accountant that's

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,450
asking me for work and so I also want to

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,920
do some work with my accountant and I'll

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,350
get back to the photography stuff

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,330
eventually and you'll like in the middle

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,890
of two worlds I don't know how many

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,160
clients you guys are working with right

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,140
now but if you're working from eight to

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,240
nine let's go back to that dial if

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,880
you're working eight to nine on an

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,570
accountancy website and then you go take

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,120
a break and then maybe 10 to 12 you're

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,950
working on a cupcake shop and then

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,140
you're gonna have lunch and then in the

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,260
afternoon you might work on I don't know

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,890
a financial planners website your day

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,840
like you your brain has jumped from how

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,850
does an accountant market himself online

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,210
what do I need to do to build his site

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,660
oh okay now what does a cupcake person

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,670
do and how can I influence customers so

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,510
that they buy and can distribute more

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,880
cupcakes you'll you're completely

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,550
separating your yourself and your energy

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,620
is being split between different types

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:43,540
of mind things that you've got to do

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,880
just to get through your every day now

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,980
when you just have one niche it's so

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,650
much easier because it's the same damn

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,340
thing every day and under that seems

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:58,030
really boring but running a profitable

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,840
business I mean business is fun right

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:05,130
but if you can get things so simplified

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,710
that it's one type of lead and

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,630
coming through the door in one fashion

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,280
and they're talking in a certain

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,080
language and you can match their

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,840
language because that's sales you're

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,520
building rapport um you'll start to have

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,920
a lot more success with those leads

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:27,000
number two I don't know what niche to

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,850
pick there are hundreds

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,640
I've actually got a what do you say a

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:36,390
worksheet to give you there are hundreds

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,590
of niches to jump into and every single

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,800
person I talk to doesn't mesh because

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,870
they cannot decide what mesh to work in

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,150
now

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,760
you can start by looking at your

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,360
passions so what are you passionate

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,990
about what do you really enjoy doing on

00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,980
your every other day I've I like

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,380
mountain biking fast cars surfing and my

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,900
dad was a tradie so that's why I did

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,370
tradies but those were will be really

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,030
good nations for me because I would

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,920
enjoy the work and I would enjoy other

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:18,720
people because I am one of those people

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:22,620
yeah so if all else fails look for your

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,770
passions otherwise consider picking a

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,780
niche is a little like dating you just

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:32,790
try it out for 90 days and if you don't

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,040
like it you swipe left or right I don't

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:39,030
know what weight is Regina I'm married

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,900
so I don't know but some you just try it

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:46,230
out for 90 days okay you don't have to

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:50,340
get married to your niche so pick a

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,780
niche and work with them and if you do

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,360
fall in love with them awesome

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,510
roll them over for another 90 days if it

00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,060
was the worst experience ever

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,360
then wrap that one up all right number

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,670
three but I like in working I like

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,710
working with a variety of people yeah no

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,800
one ever said that ever I was going back

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,720
to the point before where I sang in the

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
morning you with cupcakes in the

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,750
afternoon ooh where the accountants and

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,590
then you go into the financial planners

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,680
like her here

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:26,170
it has an itch like does anyone have one

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:30,940
soon oh yes rugs da yes so like look at

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:37,120
that two people in this entire room Oh

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:38,190
one company in this entire room niches

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,980
yeah

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,550
the fastest way to get ahead of your

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,700
competition is to nish hands down

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,820
because lead generation is going to get

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,310
so much easier for you instead of you

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,070
just winding up at web designer Sydney

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,950

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,300
specialist and all your messaging I mean

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,250
if we go back here let's I mean our site

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,260
you can't see the side I'm sure it had

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,140
something really awesome like we develop

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,820
websites as like the headline you know

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,000
what I mean like and it's like cool I've

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,050
come to the right place

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,460
attention trainees who are ready to

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,980
become the superhero of their local

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:40,839
community dominate your local area they

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,760
like this person gets me so again when

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,080
you want to attract high quality leads

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,480
if you can talk directly to the lead

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:53,230
this is not tech crap that I'm saying

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,930
it's everyday human stuff that they

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,270
would be saying tradies want to dominate

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,550
their area they want to become the local

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,339
hero that I want to drive around Sydney

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,980
the traffic is really bad I'm sorry I've

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,839
taken that you know try and take as much

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,630
out of conversations I've had with them

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,420
and then drive all that content are

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:16,990
straight into my website so if I was

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:20,380
working with everybody I couldn't say

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,150
that on the site could I because I mean

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,160
I would then upset everybody else and

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:28,060
I'd be like oh my god that's scarcity

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,060

um unwanted pests - welcome to guess you

just need to build trust all right sir

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:56,090
I'm I H in 2013 so my story goes back a

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,950
little bit technically I'm a graphic

00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,230
designer and then got a job in web site

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,700
so I fumbled my way through I got a job

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,380
I got retrenched and then I started a

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,500
business and then I hired a whole bunch

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:10,760
of stuff and everything is awesome you

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,160
could say that I'm but in 2013 I was

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,510
running some at web design the business

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,790
that I just you know made up the name

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,990
whoo that's what you do I guess and I

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:25,670
was like everybody else I was a web

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,240
designer in Sydney I mean I I have an

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:32,510
office in North Sydney and in my office

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,260
there are five other web designers

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:39,020
Sydney so how I'm like I'm sure it's

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,559
similar to where you live - how on earth

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,960
you

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:46,490
to break out and be that one special

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,749
person so in 2013 I was like you know

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,549
what I've heard of this niching thing

00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:52,100
and I think it's a really good idea and

00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:54,740
so I just picked a nation my dad is a

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,690
tradie so I was comfortable and I knew

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,090
their language and their smell and the

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,419
trucks and all this sort of stuff and

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,100
and I just got real deep in the niche

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:07,570
now the thing that I didn't do back then

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,950
that we do now is that I was all on foot

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,450
so I was going to communities I was

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,279
talking to these guys I was getting

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,230
databases I was taking the database back

00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,220
and then emailing them and trying to

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,320
follow them up and then running around

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,960
town and trying to get them into my

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,909
world my messaging sucked I mean look at

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,129
this like email marketing website online

00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:31,279
marketing and SEO social media like I

00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:32,990
was doing everything again so my mistake

00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,570
here that I want you to learn from is

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,509
that although I'm ished I was still

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:41,419
doing way too much now for us to run a

00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:44,090
profitable company that offers social

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,320
media email marketing website I mean

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,809
there's some software there that I'm

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,490
have to pay for there's some staff that

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm going to need so if I've only got

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,869
one social media account

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,850
I got to put one stuff on to manage that

00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:57,289
one social media account that's not very

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,590
profitable like you know it's not very

00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:03,649
scalable when you simplify your offer

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:07,940
you just do one thing let's go easier so

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:11,799
I'm yeah learn from my mistake there all

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:17,570
right things will look out for initials

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:21,710
they need to be in motion so don't go

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,019
into a niche that has no idea that

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,509
someone like you is really important for

00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:31,190
their world so you want them to actually

00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:33,950
know like of your service and they know

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:37,730
that it's a value and then you come in

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:42,639
like a fresh glass of water and you're

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:45,769
like oh yeah use me yeah so make sure

00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:47,360
they're in motion and they value exactly

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,610
what you do because there is nothing

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,529
worse and I'm sure this conversation has

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,030
come up before

00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:56,240
there's nothing worse than go

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:59,929
Hey would you like me to build you a

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,549
website you like I don't know what's a

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,100
website you like all well you know we

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:06,409
can build a full page website home so

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,970
this is about contact page it's got its

00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,669
got a footer and a header and like all

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,900
this stuff and they're like I don't know

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,250
do I really need a website because I've

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,740
got a couple of clients coming in and

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,390
out like you don't want that client you

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,460
want someone that when you say hey like

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,380
you know we build websites for the hair

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,809
and beauty let's say they're like oh my

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,909
god I my website really sucks and it's

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,049
not converting and analytics is showing

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:29,870
me stuff and you're like oh they know

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:33,530
what analytics is thank god that's

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:36,850
someone who's actually in motion they

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:40,909
they need to have pain and urgency

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,610
so I guess again let's go hair and

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:46,490
beauty like waxing clinic right they

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,549
need more people coming into their

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:53,240
clinic to get hair removal or they need

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:56,059
you know a haircut or makeup or facial

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,940
or whatever they sit there in their

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,059
office every single day and wish that

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,390
more leads would come in that is pain

00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:08,000
and it's urgent because a good business

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,850
owner would know that there's only so

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,230
long this cash flow can last and we're

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,380
going to start running into the negative

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:20,960
so I really need clients so make sure

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:23,929
your niche has pain and urgency the

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,659
easiest way to speed up diving into a

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,330
niche is to actually get one that

00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:34,940
already has a community so like in 2013

00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:37,100
there was trades builders networking big

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,049
event companies and I could pay 500

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,260
bucks to and go and see follow under

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,490
people and that instantly got me into

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,990
the nation talking to real people

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,620
straightaway and I would do one a

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,919
quarter so if you can find a niche that

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:55,460
has a body or it has an awards ceremony

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,190
or just some sort of community that you

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,650
can attach yourself to you're then going

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,440
to be attached to an entire marketplace

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,380
of people rather than just trying to

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,600
scrap and get them on on the Internet

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,460
all right this is where I'm gonna jump

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,840
in and do the and hopefully tech because

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,110
not get the best of us

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,520
alright let's get some clarity here I'm

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:23,270
gonna take this out Oh

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:24,580
bear with me let's hope that uh zoom

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,460
actually works

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:32,270

00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:35,750

technical difficulties I knew this is

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,350
gonna happen

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:14,809
bingo come at me come on come on

00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:20,150

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:45,160
live tech yeah exactly I'm I'm breaking

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:53,650

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,840

00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,630
all right we're gonna stick to this okay

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,960
um this is a good exercise this is not

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,790
gonna work that's great um okay great

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,480
way to see what's actually going on your

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,920
business okay

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,990
a B C and D clients so draw a quadrant a

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,820
clients they're awesome so think of

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,980
clients that are actually awesome and

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,080
you love them an awesome client for me

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,300
gives me their credit card straight away

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,240
on a sales call they're ten minutes and

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:29,260
they're paid for it's done a bad client

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,770
a dog is like that's really down D for

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:36,280
dogs but D dogs a bad client will

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,250
actually call my number on the website

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,210
and then want to just talk to me about

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:45,700
what does the website do and I did okay

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,070
I'll come back to you I guess like

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,910
that's that's a D client for us I know

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,470
and like if someone calls the office or

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,630
leaves a voicemail I know they're

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,780
they're not gonna be a client and a

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:02,250
client goes to that tradie website they

00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:08,200
hit apply for a call they walk through a

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:11,050
pretty hefty sales for name email how

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,390
much revenue are you making how much

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:17,020
revenue do you want to be making when

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,660
those two questions come up the lead has

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,970
a choice am I going to be transparent

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,520
and actually do I want to change my

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,900
business here and do I want to grow or

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,580
do I just want to get on the phone and

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,110
ask this chick some questions yeah

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,740
and he's just proof straight down to a

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:39,670
day so consider your a B C D quiets and

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,490
and like honestly doing this example

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,190
really opens your brain to the types of

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,080
customers that you

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,830
your business right now that are

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:52,460
actually amazing but there D for dogs or

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:55,780
see I can't deal there customers that

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,820
call you 24/7 all day

00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,080
bees are you know that be for basic they

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,580
might do all the good things that the

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,710
awesome clients do but they're they're

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,450
just missing a few things so if you know

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,120
the kind of a clients that you want to

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,680
attract into your business then when you

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,810
actually know what that customer looks

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,250
like you can drive them into the

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,710
business and you can start to recognize

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:20,030
exactly who they am hey ah

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:25,910
again like me I'm trying to get

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:28,400
distracted very key a client's lost my

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,280
train of thought a clients basically I

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,750
know that again D for dog if they call

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,070
me on the phone and start asking me

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,470
questions they are never going to be a

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,210
client but I know and I recognize that a

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,010
client's if they fill out my really

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,470
scary form attacks them a lot of real

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,470
questions holy cow it actually works

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,110
then they're actually going to get

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,350
through and become a client alright

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,580
sweet let's quickly jump to this okay

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,590
there's only two different types of

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,050
businesses yet this is you over here

00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:00,140
running your business

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:02,240
um this here is the plateau line I don't

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,800
believe in running a plateauing business

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,810
you're either running a business that's

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,600
being profitable or you're running a

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,630
business that is being unprofitable in

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,810
three minutes a business that is

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:18,590
actually profitable is doing the same

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:21,410
damn thing every day pushing it out

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,820
there's systems and processes and

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,270
everything works Pierce

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:31,010
those are McDonald's fries this is a

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:34,100
hamburger this is a fry that's a shake

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,080
and that's a taco you see what I mean

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,590
when you are running a business that is

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,480
pushing out logos webdev I don't know

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,270
hosting migrations and everything else

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,550
that you can do you start to lose profit

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,010
when you do the same thing for the same

00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:55,370
person every single day business gets

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:59,130
super easy to last points

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:03,570
I've got 99 99 problems but traffic

00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:05,550
ain't one there is so much traffic out

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,740
there this is the best time to be

00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,270
running a marketing agency because you

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,500
can just simply jump into Facebook and

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,230
start driving leads into your business

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,240
now the problem with that Jimmy guy is

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,780
that he's driving he's paying money for

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,240
leads

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,610
but he's offering a whole pleather he's

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,430
offering the buffet I had a buffet this

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:27,360
morning I tried everything I really just

00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,010
needed it online but some it's gonna be

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,050
very difficult for you to generate more

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,860
leads if you're actually doing way too

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:37,260
much now again to go back to the start

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,050
the four most simple things that you can

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,960
do to take away right now

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:45,990
problem understand exactly what the

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,430
problem is for your customer now again

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,350
think of one customer think of all those

00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,500
a customers what is the problem that

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:55,740
they might all have in common what is

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,290
your core solution what is the thing

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,120
that you are selling the most nine times

00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,530
out of 10 or that you love to sell it

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,750
and you know it's profitable and you

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,840
want to do it more often

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:09,300
package it give it a name the tradies

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,980
accelerate system what does that even

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,230
mean okay

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,540
but for me it means that they're gonna

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,360
get a certain package out of our office

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,730
they can't take our document anywhere

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,420
else because you can't get it anywhere

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:28,050
else okay that makes you unique last

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:32,730
piece there is market I've got a freebie

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:36,270
on the site bitly WP singer SGA

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:38,370
yes I put I've hand-picked 300 Nash's

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,590
that are awesome that you could

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,660
potentially jump into so if you want to

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:49,710
kick start your niching ideas then you

00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:52,500
can go right there that is it check your

00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:58,770
shoes at all I knew I was walking into a

00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:00,860
minefield do we have no time for

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,860
questions

00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:24,210
all right the one company you're not

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:28,250
thinking about it you might kind of like

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,260
get stuck in that particular niche and

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,809
great great question Eric we have three

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,510
websites that are all nation websites

00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:38,520
that are all ranked and they all have

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,320
their own marketing system and so when a

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,809
tradie searches for tradie website

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,460
marketing they get the tradie one when a

00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,649
hair and beauty person is searching for

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,899
a hair and beauty marketer they get my

00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:50,399
hair and beauty marketing website when

00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,720
someone in construction is looking for

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,490
construction they get my summit site so

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,020
the best way to start doing the whole

00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,490
niche thing and this is the most common

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,049
question I get is should I change my

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,669
existing website or should I build a

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:04,679
brand new one if you can build a brand

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:06,029
new one in a week then build a brand new

00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,049
one because who cares it's just a

00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,940
website anyway it's all about the

00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,320
messaging but if it's gonna take you six

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,370
months to build a new site and for this

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,919
nature's gonna be the most beautiful

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,779
thing ever stop don't do it just change

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,820
some text on your existing site and just

00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:20,279
get going because the faster your wheels

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,010
start moving forward and you connect the

00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,690
message the problem the solution you

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,690
market it you can have success

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:40,730
hey fish concept works pretty well for

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,010
that thing if you are just thinking of

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,630
starting your business you know where

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,000
you are on a blank piece of paper and

00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,760
say okay I will put your niche and this

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,110
is very good I built are you very hardly

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,090
in the business on your clients

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,790
underneath business you know which

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,800
offers so many different services how do

00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:02,450
you hold your advice effectively ship

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:05,420
there this is for your business okay um

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:08,210
so I mean I could I could argue than say

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,830
that we're running summit Web Design who

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,120
marketed and did everything for everyone

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,340
and then we eventually just ripped that

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,290
band-aid off and made that marketing

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,880
niche one website and we just spent some

00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,000
time in there so I just completely

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,380
separated myself and started doing that

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,230
that would be a good argument point to

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,480
go from again I think it goes back to

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:29,180
point number two a lot of people are

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,850
scared to mesh because it means that

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,760
there's going to be no clients so a

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,470
hundred thousand dollars eighty six

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,630
thousand dollars a month it takes to get

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,630
to a million bucks so you're gonna have

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,250
eight clients paying you ten grand say

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,360
your linear a clients so how hard is it

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,490
to nature to get eight clients a month

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:51,440
yeah like if we just do them numbers and

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,380
it's really not that scary yeah cuz you

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,540
can still make a great business out of

00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,630
what you're doing does that answer your

00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,630
question

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,259
