Title: Francesca Marano: Secure WordPress Without Coding Skills
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	Is WordPress insecure? Not at all! However, an outdated WordPress installation with a weak password and poorly chosen plugins is definitely insecure.
It’s often said that “security is a process”, and the security of your own site starts with you installing the WordPress. Why should you care about security from day one, when your website is brand new and only your mom reads it? What should you do yourself, while your site grows, even if you do not (yet) have the budget to hire experts? How can you make your visitors browsing safer? How can you minimize the chance you site got hacked?
In this talk I will go over some best practices you can implement to make your website safer and why you should care about them. None of these require a single line of code, only some common sense and understanding what is right and what should be avoided as a behaviour while you manage your site.

thank you for the introduction hello

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,299
thank you everyone for being here this

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,950
morning we have a couple more seats here

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:14,340
if you want to sit down with us no it's

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,520
okay I'm just because I don't see well a

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,660
far even with my glasses on so it's

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,369
absolutely self-serving so yeah it's my

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,470
first time in Singapore I'm super

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,910
excited and it looks like a really good

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,179
world camp so you should be excited

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,669
about your community it's a good one so

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,410
my name is Francesca I'm the WordPress

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,219
community manager at side ground the web

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,320
hosting company and giving back to the

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,070
WordPress community is actually part of

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,469
my job and it it's awesome obviously and

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,809
I get to do one of the things that I

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,760
love the most which is sharing knowledge

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,370
I think we all have something to share

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,430
and we're not going to take this with us

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:02,129
in the afterlife so we better share it

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,229
now and and I do so by you know based on

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,200
my experience or in the collective

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,590
experience of the site in this talk in

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,950
particular is based in my experience as

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,439
a hosting company employee but also some

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,369
terrible experiences that I had as a web

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,130
developer when I was freelancing I am

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,220
NOT a security expert so if any of you

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:30,240
is a security expert in this room

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,520
don't ask me advanced security questions

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,460
because the whole point of this talk is

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,829
actually talking about security in a non

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,619
menacing way for people that have no

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,189
coding skills have no security knowledge

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,770
but if there are some security expert

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,049
amongst you luckily I have a colleague

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,420
attending with me who's an expert

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,369
WordPress Enterprise engineer and it's

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,250
right outside of the sideburn booth so

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,049
if you do have advanced question please

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,939
come by the booth but don't ask me

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,630
because I I don't know the answer for

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,780
sure

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,700
so I like to think of myself as a

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,950
common-sense dispenser I'm full of

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,400
common sense so this this is what what

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:21,140
the talk is about honestly it's about

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,390
not making it over complicated there are

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,090
some basic steps that you can take to

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,000
secure your website then to secure your

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,120
browsing and they're kind of easy to

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,329
implement but a lot of time you hear the

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,610
term security and you go oh this is for

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:40,069
developers this is too complicated for

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,890
me but they're actually the very basic

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:47,810
rules of security can be implemented by

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:50,690
everyone so as I said during my time as

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:56,450
a freelancer I had a horrible experience

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:59,900
of being hacked I run a website for

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:04,299
women for female entrepreneurs in Italy

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:07,730
and one day we receive a seasoned assist

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:10,459
email from an American Lawyer and of

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,420
course we panic because what's going on

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,510
so what's going on is that a

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,440
pharmaceutical company added some

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:24,049
content to our website that was

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,200
mentioning the competitor of the company

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:30,290
and bashing it and basically we didn't

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,109
realize any of this at the time because

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,630
we had a false sense of security

00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:37,700
we had a plug-in where the plug-in

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,290
installed on the website so we said all

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,650
right this is taking care of everything

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,540
for us but that's not how it works this

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,069
is a sentence that you might have heard

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,410
a lot when we talk about security not

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,480
just in the WordPress space but security

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,160
is a process and not a plug-in a plug-in

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,790
plugins there are awesome plugins the

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,709
security plugins out there but you

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,980
cannot just rely on that you have to do

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:08,329
your homework you are part of making

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,730
your website secure so just a few words

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,709
on who carries the attacks because when

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,390
this happened to us with this website

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,209
who are like who

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,660
who wants to hack us I mean we're a blog

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,480
about it's a free blog around by

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,220
volunteers with no ads and we give

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,730
advice to women that want to start their

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:32,030
own businesses but so hacking is nothing

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,700
personal hackers don't really care about

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,290
your website unless you're the FBI or

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:42,170
any other very high profile target what

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,660
happens is that okay sometimes attacks

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,670
are carried by people but this is very

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,720
rare and unless as I said you have a

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:53,090
very high visibility website like the

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,910
white house they will not care about

00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:00,250
your blog or my knitting blog for

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:03,350
example but these attacks are very

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,690
specific and very elaborate of course

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,240
because they are custom-made to attack

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,940
that specific website what happens to

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,970
most of us that get hacked is that boats

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,570
or botnets which are next network of

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:21,500
boats will run random script and attacks

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:24,890
at a scale okay so nobody really cared

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,590
about my website it was just there for

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:34,310
the taking because it was not secured in

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:38,480
any way so both attacks are a lot less

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,680
sophisticated but they they go at scale

00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:48,380
they go at millions at a time at Sai

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:52,520
ground we have an anti anti boat AI and

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,700
it blocks millions of accesses every day

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,669
so that's the scale of the of the

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,870
attacks and botnets are just network of

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:04,910
BOTS where one computer serves as a

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:08,450
command and control but it controls all

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,979
the other computers so as I said it's

00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,500
nothing personal

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,240
so this is something that you really

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,220
have to remember because maybe you just

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,430
launched your website yesterday and like

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,130
who beside my mother is reading this

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,910
blog why should why this hacker is

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,590
caring about me why they do because of a

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,000
number

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,880
reasons because they want to basically

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,760
gain access to your website and what

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,880
they can do through your website so what

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,610
they can do a lot of website get

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,200
attacked because of spam so that's

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,210
exactly what happened to us

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,040
they added some content to our website

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,630
that we weren't aware of and they used

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:57,260
basically our website as a vehicle to

00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:02,750
distribute this ban they could be upload

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:05,090
and wanted content they could steal your

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,150
data for example as you know on

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,330
WordPress when someone comments on your

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,160
wet on your on your blog or they buy

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,560
something through WooCommerce their

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,920
email is stored actually in the admin

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,650
area so they could gain access to the

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,840
website just to build a database of

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,880
email for example they just you know

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,160
they just get all the emails and then

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,160
start sending spam that's very common

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:40,100
they can redirect so as you know linking

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,560
is still an important SEO feature so

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,930
they might link to the website from your

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,500
website so your website is still white

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,260
listed and they put just links to the

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,700
website so they can increase their

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:59,150
indexing in in Google for example they

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:04,550
could use your website as part of a web

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:07,480
of a web boat botnets already I'm

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:13,790
heavily jet-lagged if you ever noticed

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:16,700
but I'm doing my best so so or the thing

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,560
that I didn't really know still existed

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,900
but it's ransomware do you know what

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,630
ransomware is its digital ransom and

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,550
it's actually very popular unfortunately

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,290
also on social media and Instagram is

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,140
very popular if you have an account with

00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,599
a lot of followers please please PLEASE

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,550
secure it because that's very very

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,659
common to just receive an email that say

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:40,610
hey I've got your Instagram account

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:43,289
give me 5000 euros that's it

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,329
the effects being hacked has a lot of

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,829
effects first of all the reputation how

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:49,589
many of you have visited the website

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,079
that said it's hacked and really came

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,689
back probably I mean if I say that a

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,429
website has been noticed the website has

00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:59,009
been hacked I will not go back there

00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:01,860
even if they clean it one second after

00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:06,540
I've been there my trust in this website

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,600
is done I I don't trust it anymore

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,670
it gets this Google Safe Browsing is a

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,040
feature one of the many features of

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,799
Google it will say this website is not

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,259
safe for browsing so again you have to

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,290
then get it removed and you have to go

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,799
through some steps your website could be

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,949
blocked by your hosting company or your

00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:32,429
ISP at home because no one wants hacked

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:34,199
websites on their network and finally of

00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:36,749
course the cost for cleaning it up

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,869
unless you're able to do it by yourself

00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:42,689
someone has to clean this and it costs

00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:44,459
money and it costs time but in my eyes

00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:47,009
the reputation is the highest cost

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:53,279
because it's it's really done once it's

00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:56,779
done it's done so there's no chance to

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,429
reduce this to zero okay there is no

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:02,309
zero risk of being hacked it doesn't

00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:05,399
exist but you can reduce the possibility

00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:09,929
of being hacked by using some very

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,169
simple and common-sense rules the first

00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:17,339
one which is possibly the most important

00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:20,459
security issue ever is picking a right

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:23,759
password the password needs to be long

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,339
and when I mean long I mean at least 25

00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,279
characters it doesn't mean if there are

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,009
random characters or you know carrot

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,699
thing a sentence that you can read but

00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:39,449
it needs to be at least 25 characters

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:42,059
don't repeat passwords why because if

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:44,040
you use the same password for your

00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,980
website for your email address for your

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,049
Linkedin once this boats get access to

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,620
one of the services the first thing they

00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,830
do they

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,130
try the same password on every other

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,529
online service so if you use your

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,890
password more than once they will hack

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:05,160
more than one services no one remembers

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:08,850
25 characters long passwords okay so

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,210
this is why luckily we have password

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,150
managers I use one password personally

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,370
which what the number me it what the

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,410
name means is really that you need just

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,440
one password which is the password the

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:25,230
master password to access the service

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,540
and then everything else is a stored and

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:32,100
encrypted so you don't need to worry

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,960
about but honestly this is probably the

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,700
most important rule we're going to talk

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,089
about today the second one is especially

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,950
for wordpress keep everything updated

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,720
now there used to be a time and maybe

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,420
some of you remember it when there was

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,850
an update of wordpress it was panic

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,470
because you got the white screen of

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,650
death and this will call the white

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,140
screen of death you updated you didn't

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,970
know what went wrong you're just nothing

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,470
so this has really decreased

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:09,570
dramatically in the last few years so

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:11,940
don't worry about it but it starts also

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,529
from picking the right plugins and

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:20,310
themes so always pick plugins and themes

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:23,279
that have been recently updated that you

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:26,250
know are kept alive by their developers

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,800
so go see the ratings of course but also

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,870
go see in the forum if they have open

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
questions and if they reply if they

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,680
reply it means that they're still

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,839
engaged with the product so they will be

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,940
there if something happens and check it

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,670
and again check the da-rae's support

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,860
because there are right now I think over

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,810
45,000 plugins in the in the WordPress

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,209
directory and a lot of them have been

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,670
abandoned but maybe you installed it

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:55,500
like 10 years ago and now you're running

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,510
old code

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,300
which might be very dangerous for your

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,970
website how do you know if all of this

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,340
happens you go to wordpress.org

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,050
plugins or themes and then you check

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,990
there's the number of parameters that

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,660
you can check when was updated how many

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,540
installations they are tested up to this

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,510
is something a screenshot that I did a

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,280
few months ago the ratings the support

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,530
this is the important thing that you

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,390
have to look for so you know that you're

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,300
getting you're plugging from a reputable

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,160
source but also for someone that cares

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,470
about the product and they protective

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:39,420
actively and they keep applying patches

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:43,320
to it as I said update everything so

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,590
don't write in WordPress core don't

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,620
write in your team you create a child

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,950
theme you add a functions dot PHP file

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,260
but just don't mess with the core files

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,360
of anything because then the next time

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,790
you upload it you're losing everything

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,290
updated you're losing everything and

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:08,870
again there is no there honestly it's

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:12,210
really safe nowadays to to update

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,310
everything I am one of the perks of

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,340
working for hosting companies that you

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:21,960
have access to a lot of data you can

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:25,320
analyze how many updates go well and how

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:29,730
many go wrong and for example last year

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,040
you might remember the 5.0 WordPress

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:36,030
update that everyone was fearing because

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,250
it was introducing a new editor and we

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,990
were one of the first hosts to update it

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,490
on every server because we tested it

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,890
when you have this large amount of data

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,360
available you test it let's test it on a

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,060
couple of servers and it's already

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,650
thousands and thousands of customers so

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,500
if you see that nothing happens you feel

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:57,150
safe and you go on and you can update

00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,810
everything but before you update this is

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:06,140
also very very very important you should

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:09,150
always have a backup of your website

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:12,420
always look for a hosting that provides

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,900
backup services but also save your back

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,390
your backups in an offline

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,850
space for example your computer so you

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:28,310
will have two coffees if something goes

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:31,260
wrong also test the restore procedure

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,779
because don't do what I did with my

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,490
first website so III was probably

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,529
terrible I'd been a freelancer I don't

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,870
know how people hired me because the

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,779
first website that I did was my personal

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,130
website and I managed to delete

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:49,020
everything including the database

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,120
honestly I went into the into the

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,520
customer area and I just deleted

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,490
everything because I created a bunch of

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,190
websites to test and I just deleted it

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,710
and then I did have a backup but I

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,470
didn't know how to restore it so please

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,770
the tester restore your restore

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:10,440
processes so you're sure but also backup

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,740
your computer this is something that we

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,080
often forget especially if your website

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,120
is backed apples on your computer backup

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,339
the computer as well and of course what

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,330
we said about passwords applies also to

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:27,300
your computer so make sure that also the

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:31,470
computer has a very good password to to

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,830
access it and don't another thing that I

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:38,600
would say don't keep outdated version of

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,120
your backs back up in your hosting space

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,740
because there might be some

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,630
vulnerabilities in the coin in that

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,330
version of the website that you don't

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,900
know about and then the account could be

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:54,930
hacked through that so once you have a

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:58,920
few copies that are you know enough to

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,709
work with just delete everything older

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,510
so you don't have the risk of being

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:07,770
hacked for something that is not even

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:10,439
active on your website anymore one thing

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,199
that is not about securing your website

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,220
but it's about securing browsing for

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,110
everyone is HTTPS so this doesn't secure

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,800
your website it secures the

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:26,610
communication between the client and the

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,940
website it means that any data that is

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,860
put in your site your computer

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,930
not be intercepted or it can be

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,480
intercepted but it cannot be understood

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,550
via boat because it's encrypted and

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,130
honestly there is no reason not to use

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,680
it I mean when it when SSL came out

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,180
people were saying oh it slows down your

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,490
website and it's a mess and the

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,810
certificate and a lot of excuses well

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,530
let's encrypt which is one of the

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,060
institution I don't know how you call

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,820
them in English that issues these

00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,970
certificates they're free they renew it

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,030
automatically every three months and

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,900
most web hosts today use HTTP too which

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,420
makes browsing much faster anyway so

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,810
honestly there is no reason not to use

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:18,020
it and I would say that also most

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,470
hosting companies nowaday offer this for

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,510
free

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,410
I mean they should it's free so why pay

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:26,090
for that and also a one-click install so

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,940
honestly there is no reason not to use

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,790
this just go through the dashboard of

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,850
your hosting company and click on the

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:37,310
sign that says add certificate and

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,170
that's it you got a secure website well

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,590
you got a secure communication to your

00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,960
website one thing that came to me a few

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,320
months ago after I gave this talk is

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,630
that there are a lot of memes how do you

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,490
say in English memes or me me OK in

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,090
Italian we say me me which is a lot

00:18:52,490 --> 00:19:00,110
cuter I think I think it's much better

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,880
and so there are these memes around the

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,100
web but let's say what's the name of

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,760
your pet what's the name of your mom

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,320
where were you born what's your hobby as

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,200
it occurred to you that these people are

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,000
building a massive database of recovery

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,230
questions because that's what's

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,770
happening there when you put something

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,180
to recover your question what are your

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,430
recover your passwords what are the most

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,010
common questions where what's your mom's

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,600
name where were you born

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,470
what's the name of your high school

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,780
stuff like that so basically answering

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,080
to this kind of meme is like come on in

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,700
still my password so please don't do it

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,880
they're really cute I get it especially

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:47,450
if you call the mem

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:50,730
but no don't do it and now for the very

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,210
advanced amongst us I hate this but I do

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,340
it

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,809
two-factor authentication I hate it

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,549
because it's boring every time I have to

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,980
sign into something I have to take my

00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:01,410
computer my phone out and look for the

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,549
Authenticator but do it especially for

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:09,390
high-level access so two-factor

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:12,330
authentication you add a second password

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:15,600
basically that it's randomly generated

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,100
and it's time-based and you do it

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,710
through your phone so you go

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,990
does anyone here uses two-factor

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,570
authentication for something ok so I

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,690
don't have to explain too much what's

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:30,780
2fa is it's boring but it's very it's

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,049
very useful so it's a especially high

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,610
level services do use two-factor

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,220
authentication for example for your

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,200
hosting account used two-factor

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,850
authentication for your gmail account to

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,669
use two-factor authentication because

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,940
those are services that will give access

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:50,429
to other services so be sure to secure

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,620
this and if you use WordPress which I

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:55,230
think you do since you're working but

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,840
there is in the general setting area

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:01,260
they keep changing the name of this but

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,370
its membership anyone can register so

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,169
that's another very common sign that

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,500
will tell you for sure that you've been

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:12,240
act that you have additional users in

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,480
your WordPress website that you don't

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,210
know who they are admin 0 0 admin 0 1

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,070
and you get hundreds of those is because

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,730
they were able to register through your

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,500
website and gain access as admin so

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,409
unflagged that because no one really

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,650
needs to register at your website except

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:33,360
for you and the people you you pick one

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,900
thing I really would like you to walk

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,919
away from this talk with the awareness

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,470
and they were the key concept here is

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,409
that honestly security is a shared

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,360
responsibility you cannot always count

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:51,750
on someone else you have to do your part

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,049
so core developers keep core WordPress

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,770
core updated plug-in developers keep

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:58,890
plugging

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,720
update is hosting keep server updated

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,420
but you have to do your part which

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,650
starts from this very simple route that

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:12,990
I gave you and that I hope you will

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:46,650
follow so thank you for having me and I

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:50,270
hope it will be useful I personally use

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:54,420
and I'm gonna tell you exactly what I

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:57,900
need to authenticate err I use

00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:03,960
Authenticator Google Authenticator which

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:08,190
is you know that's that's a question

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:13,260
that I don't know how to answer but nope

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:22,370
sorry look this doesn't work on off

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:25,440
works no yes I am pretty sure that

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,120
there's a plug-in for that like

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,910
everything in WordPress

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,710
basically the craziest thing you can

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,670
think of there's a plug-in for that so I

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:38,670
use Authenticator and I would say to add

00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:41,190
the 2fa authentication to your website

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,230
probably there's a plug-in if it's not

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,240
developed by Google itself which is kind

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,020
of starting to develop a lot of products

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,090
for WordPress there's one for sure

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,750
thank you for asking something that I

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,750
can answer

00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:03,940
yes other questions

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:06,330
hi where I don't see anything even with

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,330
the glasses

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:14,639
no here maybe oh if you want to know

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,639
also about knitting I'm game

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,059
on side ground so what do you recommend

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:40,600
to keep backups on the website how much

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:43,539
storage ok so we do automatic backups

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,779
every day and then depending on the plan

00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:50,830
that you have you can do also request

00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:54,669
additional backups we keep them for 30

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:59,019
days on our servers and if you decide to

00:24:54,669 --> 00:25:01,210
do something additional I would say so

00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:03,580
this is already taking care of the daily

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,710
backups right but I would say if you're

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,610
gonna make a big change on your website

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:12,639
first of all never do it live always is

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:15,100
either staging or local environment but

00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:20,679
even if you do it live like I did for a

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:22,299
long time do a backup before that so and

00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,950
then once you're done with all the

00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:28,659
changes you can just throw it away

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:30,820
I mean I'm also a bit of a keeping

00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:33,580
things very neat I'm one of these people

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,340
that only has a three icons on the

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,039
desktop and so as soon as something

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,960
doesn't serve me anymore it's gone it's

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,590
either in the trash or archived

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,559
somewhere so that goes also for plugins

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:50,320
if you have plugins or themes once I got

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:54,460
a client that had something like 20 and

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:59,019
used the themes in our website that has

00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:01,000
to stop you need your theme that you're

00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:03,040
using now and if you want for example

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,560
one thing that I used to do as

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,020
as a freelancer I had the theme that I

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:12,220
was in use at the moment and then a

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:14,170
backup theme like 20 2012 2011 one of

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,910
the basic WordPress themes so if

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:19,120
something went wrong when one of the

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,220
backup I still had a base I don't know a

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,980
few months ago I don't know if you saw

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,550
that Tech Crunch had the problem like

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,910
that so WordPress VIP servers and the

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:33,430
problem so for a few hours at TechCrunch

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:35,740
reverted to 2019 which is kind of funny

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,520
but at least it was there as a backup

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:43,240
theme so I would say use that don't

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,430
don't you get themes and plugins that

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,250
you don't use because those are all

00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,220
points of attack so the same with the

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,200
backup once you're done with it I mean

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,720
keep it for a few days so you're sure

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,880
that everything goes do one before the

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,560
major changes the one after the changes

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:11,020
but don't keep too many copies I mean

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:15,760
why that's my thinking ok when it comes

00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,710
to music hosting plan that really

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,510
depends on your website there are some

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,830
website that are very light and some

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:26,580
website that are a major that have also

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,710
very big DB so it really depends I think

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,890
it's I ground the minimum space that we

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,380
give something like 10 gigs on the basic

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:39,130
plan and that should serve you for quite

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,680
a few days of backup and it goes up and

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,170
you can always buy extra storage but so

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,230
for one week of backup that should be

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:49,750
enough unless you have a major

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:53,200
photography website that weighs tons of

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:54,970
gigs so it always depends on the size of

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,140
your website basically it goes down to

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,900
the size of your website yes is it have

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,250
I replied is it a good answer ok I have

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,250
someone here in front I

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,990
don't have a question for you but

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,900
feedback Miami security professor okay

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:16,120
all of my sites I use wordfence okay

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,060
it's a very big comprehensive even the

00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,700
free one mm-hmm everything I need and it

00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:23,860
does have any free to FA with it okay

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:31,750
uses the free OTP

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:35,500
all right and so word fences word very

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:42,490
highly recommended and so you know one

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:45,340
of your criteria yeah okay alright then

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:51,340
wordfence word as in WordPress and fence

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:54,910
as a Oh offense Thanks yes more

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,420
questions one and two I see one there

00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,420
and one there

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,300
thank you for coming

00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:24,590
and parties happy I'm sure that this is

00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:27,559
secure ah so you want to give cPanel or

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,720
admin area access to a third person

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:34,309
because they need to work on your

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:37,070
website there okay so there's a question

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,840
how we sold that at side round doesn't

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,409
answer how we sold that at SCI ground

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,350
and an answer on how you solve those in

00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:47,869
other places so in other places I would

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,480
say never share your password with

00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:53,480
anyone even your mother or son or

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,039
partner your password is sacred and it's

00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:01,700
yours so if you can add a user add a

00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,860
user and I don't know if you can control

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,409
the level of access they have to your

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,379
website I think again there are a lot of

00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:12,559
tools for that that are not hosting

00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:15,769
dependent and why would you want them to

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,809
access your hosting plan not just your

00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,759
website you probably want them to to

00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:38,659
access your website because they need to

00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:40,549
update stuff I don't know well yes but

00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,470
that's at WordPress that's what

00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:45,230
WordPress access in terms of hosting

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,350
well I know that recently we launched a

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:50,029
product that solves that but that's for

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:54,139
side-burner I wouldn't know for other

00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:56,299
hosting how to have to do this but so

00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:59,299
the general rule would be don't share

00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:03,320
your axis with anyone honestly if you

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,789
can add a added user and then you can

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,780
see through the logs if they did

00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:17,000
something that is not right

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:20,840
yeah what things we've been yeah the

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,070
change again I would say if you work

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,710
with other people I would go the

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:30,860
distributed development environment

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,800
Ridge with version control would get so

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,930
you know who's you can approve what's

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,320
being deployed before it's been deployed

00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:41,660
so you can prevent anything from happen

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,330
but this requires obviously having a

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,830
development workflow that works with

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,220
that and that you can do with most

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:54,050
hosting they will give you a sage key so

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:56,270
you can you can deploy through gift we

00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,780
have space for one more question yes you

00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,780
had a question

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm here assistance of what's the value

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,220
at where we confess it even managed to

00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:23,860
do that I cannot answer to that because

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,580
I don't know the other platforms I'm

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,110
sorry but I'm sure even my colleague

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,660
knows more about this because he also

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:36,640
works on the enterprise team so we

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:41,920
probably have more more of a knowledge

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:44,170
about this I have personally I even

00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,300
before I started working for a grant I

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,950
always used managed hosting because I

00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,900
cannot be bothered with that that's not

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:54,400
my job so unless you're a success I mean

00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:56,440
I why would you take that like if you're

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,720
a freelance developer you already have

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,730
to wear so many hats because you have to

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,130
develop and market yourself and deliver

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,310
and do the accounting why do you want

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:08,770
also the manager service I mean as as

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,830
long as someone else does it for you but

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,600
I technically I think even is the best

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,970
person to reply to this and there are

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,950
other other hosting companies sponsoring

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,650
work in Singapore so you can get more

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:26,470
feedback from everyone I think we're out

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:28,990
of time this is the quick one possibly

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,650
about knitting or Italian food why no

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,800
one has asked me about it's my kidding

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm kidding

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,200
