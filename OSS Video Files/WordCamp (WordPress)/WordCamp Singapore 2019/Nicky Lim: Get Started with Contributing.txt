Title: Nicky Lim: Get Started with Contributing
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	In early 2019, I took a class at Cornell University on contributing to Open Source and worked with a team of 6 under the guidance of a WordPress mentor. I will share my experience as a first-time contributor to WordPress: how I familiarized myself with the codebase, got in touch with the WordPress Core (Privacy) and Gutenberg community, and pushed my first few patches out. I hope to entice you into joining this challenging and exhilarating group of WordPress contributors that will allow you to build impactful software and keep your developerâ€™s edge razor sharp.

[Applause]

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,400
hello everyone good morning and welcome

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,019
to my talk so I'm going to present on

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
getting started contributing so

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,559
hopefully you guys have some interests

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,199
in learning how to contribute to this

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:23,090
open source project if not you might

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,090
want to check out the other room okay

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:33,640
Oh No okay a little bit about me so as

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,350
as introduced I started a college

00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,600
hackathon and I've been contributing the

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,010
WordPress early this year

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,550
so what's part of a class I took at

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,710
Cornell University where I where we did

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,080
open source software engineering so I

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,879
had a physical team of six people six

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,579
students and I know what Pressman saw

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,170
who live not far away and by not far

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,989
away I mean like a four-hour drive away

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,449
so it's because I this guidance and this

00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,980
person experience I thought be nice to

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,360
share with you guys if any of you are

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,390
interested in learning how to contribute

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,369
to WordPress so as a team we look into

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,080
model components so our introduced

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,920
components later but you can think of it

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,539
as a subdivision of the core code we

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,270
look into Gutenberg which is a new

00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:17,500
editor and we look into privacy so

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,600
privacy is something that's very close

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,130
to my heart and something that I'm going

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,600
to share you guys in this presentation

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,190
so at the end of this presentation I

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,940
really want to give you guys four key

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,770
takeaways that you guys can remember for

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,630
for contributing so the first is to

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,429
understand structure to me understanding

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,979
structure it's very important because it

00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,110
gives you a mental model and a framework

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,380
to understand how coding works for

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,470
WordPress and how you can investigate

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,360
the Box how you can gain insights from

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,390
the code and how you can use it to solve

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,789
your problems in coding the second one

00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,340
start by copying it sounds like

00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:59,530
plagiarism I swear it's not but when I

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,270
mean start by copying is because no box

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,259
out there are no tickets are there

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,970
created equal

00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:07,810
they're easy ones and they're harder

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,280
ones so as a first timer you will want

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,989
to approach the easy ones you want to

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,800
start by crawling before starting the

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,020
random marathon

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,970
the third one people in funding

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,790
community I think we can all agree that

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,819
it takes a village to raise a child no

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,379
one works in silos so if you want to

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,330
start this open source contributing

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,120
journey and you were to attack it alone

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,830
it's very daunting but if you are not

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,319
afraid in funding community if you want

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,750
to link up with like-minded peers

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,519
attending what came for one it's going

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,710
to sustain you and motivate you to do a

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,360
good job

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,950
last one to the ticket slow take it slow

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,760
when you contribute especially if you do

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,190
it on the voluntary basis it takes time

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,630
to get things done but you can take into

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,030
comfort that your progress is tracked

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,940
and your progress is all online and

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,040
there are chat locks so it takes a slow

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,810
it takes a slow process but it gets done

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,240
so what was my journey light I'll take

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,340
you to my journey and I'm going to split

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,050
in those three phases first is recon

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,210
where you start to understand what it's

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,240
like to contribute to WordPress next is

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,350
you set up its a first-time thing to to

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,360
care your environment I've been running

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,630
for developing and the last one is

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,220
patching this is the crux of this

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,560
experience is where you find a bug that

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,390
you're passionate in you write some code

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,510
to fix it and then you push it out and

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,120
you fix it so let's start with number

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,700
one recon so if you were to visit

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,250
WordPress on your web browser you get

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,570
this beautiful website you want to

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,520
register an account the top right hand

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,380
corner in the red circle so once you

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,290
register an account you are contributor

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,300
well done you also get a slack account

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,210
where if you guys are not aware of

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,830
selects like is a channel messaging

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,480
platform where a lot of developers like

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,780
to get on and discuss ideas

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,790
and and when you have credit account you

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,540
want to hit call below you can see

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,570
there's many different ways to

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,040
contribute not just coding I think

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,050
further down there's also stuff on like

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,580
community building and like volunteering

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,010
at what gem itself it's it's

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,920
contributing but in might sort of focus

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,630
on contributing the core and we didn't

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,060
call as I mentioned earlier there's many

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,030
components so one component is the

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,330
privacy component so whole components

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,470
it's a subdivision of the core code and

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,530
this is the example we can bring it to

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,780
to to key information the first one is

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,100
getting involved with the community so

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,360
you can see there's a shot right up

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,520
there I'm not sure if those at the back

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,610
end see it's it's weekly meetings and

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,810
back Scrubs done over slack so at a good

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,430
time

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,110
people just come online and start

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,060
chatting to say hey I'm having problems

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,470
with this bar can you have me fix it and

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,320
it brings down together it's because

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,490
what comes with what process philosophy

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,919
is to work

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,720
centralized can walk on my office you

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,979
can work from any country against you

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,389
hold meetings like that I think that's

00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,430
amazing

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,410
the second one is at the bottom half so

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,289
this gives you a very big overview of

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,819
the privacy component so at this at this

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,289
time I'm going to took a screenshot it's

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,729
like 99 tickets open vertically spin to

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,910
the different types of tickets available

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:17,460
I explain what the kids are you can see

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,860
some are defects some enhancements and

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,750
some feature requests and then

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,229
horizontally it refers to the milestone

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,349
so if you guys use WordPress which I

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,330
believe you guys do different releases

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,419
are staged and they are released in

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,130
discrete releases so like 1.0 one by one

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,380
all the way and I believe the latest one

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,199
is 5.3 so you can see there's some

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,940
tickets packed 25.3 sum is everything

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,949
with you so they are not sure how to

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,599
prioritize it and the last ones future

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:50,120
release which is D prioritized in

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:54,780
respect to 5.3 so one is a ticket a

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:58,229
ticket is a unit of problem that needs

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,840
to be fixed and it's tracked by this

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,419
software track it's a wordpress ticket

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,000
tracker so if you go to the website

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,770
wordpress top and you go to get involve

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,289
there's a link that brings you to track

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,380
and you get this screen so it's usually

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,210
a huge list of tickets thousands tens of

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,409
thousands in this case there are some

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,289
things you can add which are filters

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,539
over here so I'll show you some of the

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,349
filters available so one is the

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,150
component which I fill it to privacy now

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,729
wants keywords so you can think of

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,599
keywords as attack to the ticket it's

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,819
like sometimes when you have an

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,530
Instagram post you can hashtag stuff so

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,050
that you can easily categorize in the

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,009
buckets so this keyword for example is

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,409
has a patch and needs unit testing now I

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:46,050
limited the now stone to future releases

00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:48,750
and also limit also filtered it to

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,509
different statuses so I'll show you guys

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,009
on what kind of staff to stay over here

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,780
was oops

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,099
because it's something that really

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,240
helped me back in contributing when I

00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,969
didn't understand what the different

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,889
statuses are so a status is like a

00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:02,880
lifecycle difficut so some found the

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,790
problem

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,340
exists in track so what happens to the

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,610
problem so one thing is that someone

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,350
gets assigned to it so you can think of

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,120
someone being assigned as the one fixing

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,200
the problem so if you're interested in

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,860
fixing the problem you can assign

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,870
yourself to it sometimes when there's

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,580
someone assigned to it you do not want

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,870
to touch the ticket because you do not

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,890
want to do double work you do know when

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,750
to work on something someone else is

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,360
working but sometimes although it's a

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,930
sign it gets still so like the last

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,490
comment is three to four months ago or

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,660
there's no development in it and you can

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,840
always feel free to pick up a still

00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,280
ticket because sometimes the person

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,950
assigned to it can no longer work on it

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,290
because they're not exactly 100%

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,090
full-time contributors another one's

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,340
owner so the owner can think of it as

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,470
like the project manager the one who

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,260
makes sure the ticket gets done the one

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:58,440
that oversees the tickets journey and

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,820
then there's closed as well so I filter

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,830
out close because we don't want to look

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,950
at closed tickets we want to look at the

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,360
kids we want to work on so now they have

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,850
never get a true track and you have

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,800
found interesting ticket what do you do

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,050
this means us was the second phase where

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,320
you stopped the environment so this is

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,120
one to vvv which are used it's very

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,790
helpful and it's a allows you to create

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,060
a virtual environment in WordPress so

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,830
I've added a link where you can install

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,680
it and I think I believe chapter two

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,330
gets you installed and chapter six gives

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,090
you some default credentials for you to

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:38,340
log into like the database and the

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:41,130
WordPress admin console once you get

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,770
this virtual environment started and you

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,050
go to vvv test on the website you get

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,410
this screen on the bring you bring our

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:53,220
attention to two parts so one is what

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,540
fresh trunk this is the repository or

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,600
the installation that you're going to

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,130
work on and the code on the modify

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,560
there's a UI oh and a photo and your

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,970
desktop it tells you what to touch on

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,830
the right side it's because in my

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,840
journey of this ticket it requires me to

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,900
interact with the database server and

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,250
the mail email client so over there

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,030
there's PHP myadmin

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,070
and mail hawk so at this point in time

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,710
my symbolize in your head it sure was

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,570
when I first started it so this is where

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,890
I wonder the invites emphasize that you

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,700
need to understand the structure of

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:30,040
WordPress code so I tried to organize it

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,470
in my hair simply and this is the

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,390
architecture as I see it so this is

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,880
giant box all right this is your

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,250
computer or your code and all your

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,010
software lives inside it right you

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:47,800
installed this folder vagrant local

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,290
wwwww and then what were strung refers

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,610
to the installation that you had and

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,710
within this folder there's a source

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,190
folder and a beautiful so if you guys

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,690
are familiar with building code the

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,580
source folder is where you have your

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,580
code and wants to be modified all the

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,960
code that runs the project and then you

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,810
build it and then you get this beautiful

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,110
and that's what gets run when you spin

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,940
up your WordPress so this build for the

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,030
powers the different virtual

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,070
environments so I point out you guys out

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,690
the trunk and this was a one-in-two so

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,610
they spent three different installations

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,280
for you but we were just focus on trunk

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,280
and we didn't run this cloud of what

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,930
rest call code that's that's that's very

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,090
confusing out there so we put a cloud

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,400
and then there's a PHP server and a mail

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,610
server which I will help you guys

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,680
understand throughout this presentation

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,260
so the PHP server the database and I

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,110
stumbled across a talk at my first what

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,020
can in Lancaster Pennsylvania and it's

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,850
myself about forever ello yes hope I

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,290
pronounced it right and this is a link

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,970
to its presentation so it's something

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:56,320
that I discovered because I entered I

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,630
attended what cam so this this brings me

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,950
to my key takeaway on number three where

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,250
it's important to find the community

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,600
because if I wasn't if I didn't put

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,450
myself out there to learn more about

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,040
WordPress and to learn more about how it

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,600
works by turn into what time I would

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,760
have stumbled across this amazing talk

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,280
and I also found out what what cam

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,350
Singapore the mic is gonna present on

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,930
images and I this ticket which I was

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,310
working on images which I got stopped

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,680
and haven't touched it for a few months

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,710
so maybe Mike can help me in getting

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,920
some insects so yes people in finding a

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,170
community

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,950
so now that we Excel environment we have

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,180
reconned

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,820
we stand do the fun stuff patching so

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,640
this is a ticket I'm gonna break it down

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,730
with you guys so there's a ticket ID

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,650
four five eight eight nine it says to

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,270
include session tokens as personal

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,730
information in data export in Tunisia

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,770
and in the description he says a

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,170
politically raises some concerns about

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,000
whether we missed any personal data and

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,100
then this suggests to me oh you missed

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,600
something so I've got to modify the code

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,140
I just need to add something right

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,250
that's that's that sounds easy I miss

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,740
something where the personal information

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,810
exports was released Oh what's personal

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,580
information exports let's keep the

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,530
question in mind upon further

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,720
investigation called privacy team from

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,420
multiple places in the user meta table

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,150
oh the user Mehta table in databases

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,040
okay let's investigate the few contains

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,080
information that we should include in

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,880
exports the county known ones are

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,820
certain job certain tokens and comedy

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,810
events okay we have to to work on Oh

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,400
community events will be handled by

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,500
another ticket okay just one that's

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,510
simple the scope of the ticket isn't

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,670
about removing on an anonymizing this

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,680
information instead just including it

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,930
with the current user export interior

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,970
tools okay so we need to include

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,340
something to mean this sounds like a

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,300
low-hanging fruit a bank that's not too

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,850
hot i just need to add something so this

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,720
this investigation process is what I

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,490
mean by by category number two start by

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,230
copying right you want to find ticket

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,930
that's easy to handle right as a

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:10,020
first-timer you do not want to start by

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:11,640
something too hot so on the on the first

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,650
question over here on the right side

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,780
what is personal information exports

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:19,740
i investigated and i played around the

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:23,070
wordpress admin site and then this is an

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,100
example of the exports where you can you

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,590
can get out details about your user so

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,930
as a user of your website i can i can

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,390
find out what this website has about me

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,830
and i can export the data so you see

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,550
there's many interesting data points

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,810
here and one unique one I found was user

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,750
registration day

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,480
okay user registration tip let's keep

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,890
that in mind the other question from

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,870
before was user Mehta table in databases

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,090
okay now that pretended the database

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,610
talk I know how database works I know

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,100
what to click so I went to this screen

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,950
cool on the on the left side there's a

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,290
WP underscore user meta okay so this

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,310
must be the table it's referring to and

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,070
it's a bunch of different data points

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,990
over here and then when i zoom in uh-huh

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,000
session tokens exactly the data point

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm looking for that the tickets looking

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,150
for so now all I need to do is take that

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,200
information and add it to their personal

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,700
information exports so how do I do it

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,400
remember user registration date from

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,060
before all I had to do it also search

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,100
for that phrase in the entire core code

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,760
and on the green arrow you see there's a

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,830
hit if this user magician did so I just

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,130
bring up this screen and I see the code

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,780
okay I just need to include something so

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,360
in the vent arrow I just copy and paste

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,420
it I modify the name to session tokens

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,440
and on the right side it's a switch case

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,900
statement where four different keys I

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,180
print different information to my

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,190
exports so I just create a new a new

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,430
case for some tokens and if you

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,800
understand PHP on this code here just

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,200
passes or PHP object to make sure you

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:15,110
get your relevant data points so with

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,089
that I built the code using grunt so

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:21,060
this is explaining the in the

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,280
contributors handbook and then you can

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,720
see on the on the right side after I

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,320
built my cool and regenerator this

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,110
report

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:34,110
there's the users users session token at

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:35,820
the bottom so yeah ticket is fixed so

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,040
now they fixed the ticket you need to

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,370
put your work out there right so there's

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,200
there's two ways you can do it so on the

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,240
left side if you upload a ticket and the

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,700
right size if you want to download

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,020
a patch so you might want to download a

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,430
patch because someone's working on the

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,500
patch and you want to apply the eye

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,270
patch on your system if you want to

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,850
write unit tests or verify that their

00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,940
patch works all right so in this case we

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:02,220
have up we have fixed we have fixed with

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,930
a patch so again I just grunt to upload

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,270
the patch with the pet without ticket ID

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,040
organ just do it manually where we do as

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,540
we end if and we save it to a dot they

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,220
foul and remember the uploading on the

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,800
website yep so this is a screen shot of

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,500
me engaging on slack and you can see I'm

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,530
in the core privacy channel and asking

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,040
like simple questions and everyone on

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:28,410
the chat with a friendly everyone didn't

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,960
didn't call my question stupid or asked

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,690
me to stop asking stupid questions so

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,120
yeah to me it felt very comforting yeah

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,680
and then on the left side some of them

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,450
even reached out to me and had a

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,370
one-to-one chat with me and say hey as a

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,260
new contributor you can consider looking

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:48,780
at this areas so she'll do Garrett his

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,010
this is Canada flag Day which is kind of

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,840
cool

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,370
he guided me the process he was like a

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,080
mentor to me as well and you really

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,700
helped me so you see people people are

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,910
very friendly on on the WordPress

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,240
community this is another screenshot of

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,700
my team at school if any of you

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,050
recognized George is a WordPress

00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,820
contributor who lived not far away and

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,590
and the six of us were those involving

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,630
the team so as a team we did some good

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,520
and books up as well but I will not

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,930
share this talk cause it's too shocked

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,580
and yeah I just want to emphasize that

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,740
it's very important there for community

00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,990
because if not for these guys I felt

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,270
like I was just given up at contributing

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,740
like it's too hot and it's it's not

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,000
something that I'm getting paid for so

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:39,810
why do it now yeah so what's the status

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,310
now gross cost 20 bidding is really not

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,490
a sprint it's not something that you

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,680
want to solve it and then you can like a

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,870
lot of stuff or other ways it's more

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,400
like I really believe in this project I

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,900
really believe in WordPress as open

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,260
source project and I just wanna do my

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,200
part in in contributing the thing is

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,090
that this situation is not all that rosy

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,070
I've got a lot of tickets hanging I've

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,049
got some tickets done and in progress

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,359
for example like my images one I just

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,129
have no idea how to fix it and I've been

00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,989
plugging in the last few months because

00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:12,359
I graduated in me and I've been

00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:14,429
traveling and I've relocated back to

00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,639
Singapore and like I just haven't found

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:20,940
time to sit down and I quote on the plus

00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:23,879
side in my journey I found smaller

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,259
tickets outside on WordPress so like

00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:27,840
some common tickets are like

00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,570
documentation errors you see typos in it

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,159
you see typos in the documentation I

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,619
feel like you misunderstand something

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,330
and you want to clarify it so because of

00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,909
that I got several tickets waste

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,159
I found issues I've got several tickets

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,289
emerged and I think is really a fun

00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,230
process so if you do not get to pent up

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,049
about fixing one ticket and let it burn

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,789
you out then you really enjoy this

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,869
process and this is what I mean by

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:57,269
taking it slow because contributing is

00:18:53,869 --> 00:19:01,129
it's like that you just need to not hop

00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,129
up on one ticket and just let it sit

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,509
these are some good documentation that

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,549
really helped me through my journey and

00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:10,769
it will help you if you want to get

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,840
contributing so the first one is really

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:16,080
just a contributor handbook telling you

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,090
how to get started if you enjoy reading

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,999
stuff it's great but if you don't really

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,609
enjoy reading stuff you can just you

00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,989
know talk to people who have contributed

00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:26,340
the book the bottom two is like the code

00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:28,259
reference and the Codex and it's like

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,820
the holy grail of contributing if you

00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,919
want to Google functions you can go to

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,450
the website and find out how functions

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,830
work or where your parameters are being

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,389
passed these two links will help you

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,940
with that on reiterate the four key

00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:43,499
takeaways verses understand structure if

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,159
you can have a good mental model of how

00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:48,989
things work you can gain very valuable

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,629
insights about how it workers how

00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:55,440
WordPress works it's a very complicated

00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:57,480
very complicated code base that is a

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,309
very beautiful code base because so many

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,350
people were going to so many people edit

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:03,629
on it and so many people do it because

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,299
they love it not because you know they

00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:09,090
need to earn money number two start by

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,460
copying if you want to fix bugs or you

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,869
want to create new feature find the easy

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,239
ones first

00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:17,999
there are some key words like first time

00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:20,399
I'm sorry I'm good first box that you

00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,989
can use and you really want to start

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:24,239
small so you can be the confidence to

00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:26,039
tackle something bigger number three be

00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,269
bold in finding community I think what

00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,190
words does a good job in creating

00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:33,239
communities with what camps all around

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,070
the world with WordPress meetups with a

00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:37,919
decentralized chatting platform we can

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,409
easily get in touch and I think it's

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,669
very important to get to be bold in

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,249
finding community because a community

00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:48,539
will sustain you and keep you going and

00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:50,190
the last one is to take it slow is to

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:53,159
adjust your commitments and not to get

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,909
too jaded when one ticket doesn't get

00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,849
fixed so with this four key takeaways I

00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:21,599
hope you enjoy my talk and thank you you

00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:23,940
can find me at nucleon there's a few on

00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,379
the coffee table handbook I come in my

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,859
dear I can't remember it at the top of

00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:27,869
my mind

00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:31,669
yeah bye I believe as two or three

00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,669
alternatives yeah

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:59,860
I've never considered contributing

00:21:42,400 --> 00:22:02,290
because I interaction yeah maybe share

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,760
Lebanon Gutenberg so uncute embodies

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,660
managed quite differently they do not

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,760
use trend is github and Gutenberg is

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,050
organized in a way where there's many

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,350
people on the team because it's such a

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:16,480
big project and I remember one team that

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,480
the accessibility so accessibility is

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,600
making what press accessible to those

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,450
with disabilities or difficulties and

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,480
stuff like that so just just interacting

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,600
you've the chat locks on github

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,150
conversations I noticed some some

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,550
individuals just help give comments and

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,920
help design to say you know what press

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,960
shouldn't use these default colors

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,750
because these default colors are how to

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,640
see on screen readers and they don't

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,860
come our perspective of code they come

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,770
from a perspective of using so I think

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,750
if if you are comfortable getting

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,910
plugged into the conversations in github

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,010
and how to navigate a website and how to

00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,630
type a comment I mean it's a lot of

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:05,430
value for the contribute even as a non

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:05,430
coder yeah now one question in the back

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,590
we need to learn how to use SVN okay we

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,860
just use D if you want to contribute the

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:52,830
most of cause SVN for legacy reasons if

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:54,110
you want all right open to all no one

00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:12,120
checks your credentials

00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:14,310
yeah but I mean it depends on how they

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,440
pack the ticket so from before I share

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,650
the idea of milestones just like five

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,390
point three everything with you and

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,490
future release so if you want to walk on

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,630
something that's coming soon you can

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,030
work on the ticket that's packed for

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,340
five point three if if you don't really

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,170
mind you can just you know do the rest

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,820
I've got some friends over actively on

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,190
five point on the latest release on

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,590
Guttenberg so I think the latest one was

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,450
released a few months ago and then their

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,010
names got like props on the release

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:45,020
update and they're like celebrating all

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,020
my name is mentioned yeah yeah

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,080
I have one more plug is that tomorrow

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,090
that's contributors day I know Mike is

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,289
doing a workshop on contributing so if

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,299
you want to get your hand study you

00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:08,330
should go for that yeah that's all I

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,330
have

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,869
