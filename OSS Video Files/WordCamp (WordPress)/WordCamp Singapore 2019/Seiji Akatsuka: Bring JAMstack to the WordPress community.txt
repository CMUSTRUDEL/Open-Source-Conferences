Title: Seiji Akatsuka: Bring JAMstack to the WordPress community
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	When is your site not built with the JAMstack? Is it a site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress? No, I’d like to share some idea about front end and back end to bring JAMstack to the world’s most popular CMS.

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,760
myself briefly I'm working for digital

can find and find and make many lot of

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,860
friends through attending some sessions

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:56,219
and variety of activities and also some

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,059
party in Japanese car Rio Caya ok and

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,570
this is organizer one organizer who

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,570
bootcamp Singapore yeah okay

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,659
and this is much end up I'd like to talk

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,740
about why how what using jump sock

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,009
approach to WordPress frost-free general

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,009
I'd like to share about reason why why

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,049
I'd like to recommend it

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:25,080
jump stack is an architecture which can

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,790
make our website more faster easier to

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,420
manage cheaper to scale and more secure

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,909
so it provided us much better user

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,890
experiences so that why would better to

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,409
try this approach in some specific cases

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:47,549
in use jump start to WordPress there are

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,610
three elements jump start a new

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,460
architecture for web developers on the

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,310
on your left side and the people who

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,829
publishing articles like me is on the

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,560
right side and in the middle there is a

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,790
way to connecting jump second people in

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,790
is WordPress

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:12,690
so let's dip that was deeper to these

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:16,030
elements so first element is jump stock

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,870
according to John stock project it's

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,210
offered a so new web web developing

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,600
architecture based on JavaScript

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,530
client-side JavaScript and reusable

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,340
api's which handle data transfer and

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:37,030
communication building microservices and

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:41,020
provided mock-ups so basically using

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,970
jump jump start to wordpress some some

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:48,130
kinds of plugins like e-commerce

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,530
marketing and send some other features

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:57,910
which need data transfer and PHP must be

00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:02,470
must be updated to some some micro

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:06,040
services and this is a basic

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:10,060
architecture for or jump stack all the

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,930
code is distributed to CDN to reduce

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,260
time reduce load time of each pages so

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,400
jumps up website do not need to rely on

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:25,870
server-side code so they think they can

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:31,120
be distributed to CDN much easier and

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:35,430
also can deployed code every version of

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,500
site whenever we want and sometimes

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,870
generating static markup stickers takes

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,090
a few minutes or more so we need to do

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,700
atomic deployment like blue/green

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:52,900
deployment to eliminate downtime during

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:56,080
jump sucks jump stock deployment so Java

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,769
suck website fits these these cases for

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,670
example company site landing page and

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:07,480
job site are typical cases because these

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,810
are almost stable and seasonable catalog

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,230
site are usually updated once or twice a

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,959
year and for the event when we are done

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,789
on our

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,820
our tasks we do not update it anymore

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:26,580
and second element is people who

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,039
publishing articles jump that is a

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,789
wonderful idea for web developer and

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:35,789
visitor hope for our website however if

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:39,180
I was in this situation I'd like to ask

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:45,630
to use Gutenberg or any other page

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:48,690
builders so because I need to put a lot

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,440
of blog posts to almost every day and

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,110
that an actor asked my colleague to

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,120
check my post because it is a best way

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:02,070
for me to to collaborate with each other

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,130
for the last element is WordPress

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,289
I think WordPress is a bridge between

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,250
jump stack and people who publishing

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:15,570
articles because we can use great page

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,599
builders manage post and the great

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:24,260
beautiful things useful thing use of

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:28,010
plugins and also can use also can use

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,360
what WordPress dashboard translated into

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,930
multinational languages by WordPress

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,770
community these are in Ottawa very top

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,630
WordPress and my second topics is how

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,240
can we bring jump start to do who are

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,750
press I'd like to share about three

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,990
patterns there this is a simplest

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,960
pattern to you to go static because

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,349
there are a lot of plugins to to

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,630
transfer it to static and also can

00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:01,110
deploy to static site hosting like

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:04,620
Amazon s3 Natura file github pages and

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:08,009
so on it is good idea to use these

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:13,340
plugins because we can easily try a jump

00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:16,440
shot approach with our previous site and

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,419
second approach is to use headless

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,199
workers and static site generators

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:25,169
because it is good idea for web web

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,770
developers who who used to static site

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,810
generator like gas PJs because

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,250
it can use many kinds of data sources

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,470
including WordPress and so they can they

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,870
can choose their favorite static site

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:46,830
generator and their clients also use

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:53,160
WordPress has managed posts or managed

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:56,220
posting as as usual and third pattern is

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,220
to use these ordinary

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,280
ordering one hosting services it is an

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,560
easiest way to to go static not only for

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:11,340
webs WordPress developers but also

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:14,159
static site generators people because we

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,490
don't need to care about any any

00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:20,300
server-side the environment and

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:24,900
WordPress also updated automatically

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,940
so these services consist of managed

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,440
hosting for WordPress static site

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,349
generator and static hosting service and

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,199
some service like like shifter has

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:39,960
integrated to other environment like net

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,340
reply and also integrated to static site

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:50,969
generator like github pages guitar and

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:53,699
the other static site generators so um I

00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,680
think these services expand WordPress

00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:00,539
ecosystem to outside the WordPress

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,669
developers and my final topic is about

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,940
what changes can jump that mix for

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,849
WordPress the biggest change is that PHP

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,349
can not work in this environment for

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:15,780
example when we are using use some

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:18,389
contact form on our website we need to

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,719
use some some alternative way to enable

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,360
it because PHP cannot handle data

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,509
transfers and also other features like

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,880
Search comments ecommerce and other

00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,810
features which need data transfer and

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:39,240
PHP must be must be replaced with some

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:41,560
alternative ways so jumpstart refocus

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,610
the server-side dynamic rendering

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,089
by a PHP to static site client-side

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:55,480
static site clients dynamic site dynamic

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:57,459
rendering by a JavaScript nepa api's in

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,449
conclusion I mentioned about these

00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:03,879
things firstly gem stack providers much

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:06,639
better user experiences that work better

00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,639
to use these this approach in some

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,769
specific cases and secondly there are

00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,220
many way to bring jumpstart to WordPress

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:17,709
I mentioned about three patterns last

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,930
three jumpstart refocused the

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,509
server-side dynamic rendering of our PHP

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,689
to client-side dynamic rendering

00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:28,529
Voyageur JavaScript and ideas it makes

00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:33,999
our website more faster easier to manage

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:35,889
cheaper to scale and and more secure so

00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:38,379
let's bring jumpstart to a press

00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:41,610
community to make our of our

00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:47,259
collaborators happy thank you very much

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,259
[Applause]

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,370
- I was still at pattern

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:07,670
what chance that how happy worked but he

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,670
thought I use th element and oppressed

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:22,030
yes jeomsun PHP jumps a 12-person use

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,610
static site generator so website combats

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:34,150
pH work with dynamic WordPress website

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,150
to static HTML and provide through CDN

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,940
yes

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:43,180
static markup where they say ship yes

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,180
yes

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:10,640
you don't we don't need we don't have

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,570
CDN we usually have we always use some

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:19,040
natural fire and any other CDN service

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,040
yes so caching is very important

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,089
[Music]

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,089
any final questions

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:54,990
thank you yes it's the most important

00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:59,660
question I think there are some service

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:05,220
south services Chop Shop Phi and and

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:09,089
just simple shopping cart is ok but if

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:13,769
we need the full-scale shop inside like

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:18,209
e-commerce it doesn't work on jumpstart

00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:23,149
environment because it's it needs a very

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:23,149
difficult to control cash cash control

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,470
okay it around put your hands together

00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:37,549
thank you

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,549
