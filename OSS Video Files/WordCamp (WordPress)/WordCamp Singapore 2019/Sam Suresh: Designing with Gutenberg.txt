Thank You Ricky

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,809
good afternoon everyone I still excited

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,360
what's the energy level one to ten tend

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:22,320
to be the best and one to the mmm I'm

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:25,500
training Sam all right so before we'll

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,140
get started very quick survey how many

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,099
of you actually using guttenberg for

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,050
your day to day post publishing and how

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,329
many of you have disabled Gutenberg and

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:44,280
using classic editor how many of you

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,410
actually hate Gooden Burke okay one

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,469
final question how many of you actually

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,110
have no idea what I'm talking about

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,270
thank you all right so let me just show

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,120
you a survey that I've conducted on my

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,770
social media I asked people what is the

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,980
editor you're using in your WordPress

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,589
and this is a respond I got like a

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,200
majority using classic editor and some

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,470
of them using Gutenberg and very few

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,409
people using other editors and this

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,320
question is for day-to-day publishing so

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm not talking about page designs as a

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,270
web developer you probably designing a

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,590
page which is for example about us or

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,659
our products you might be using page

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,150
builder or fantastic page builder

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,220
commercial commercial page builder these

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,829
are the pages we usually use page

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,960
builders that's absolutely fine I'm

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,670
talking about day to day publishing

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
let's say in your company today you are

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,990
writing an article about what camp

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,369
Singapore how many of you planning to

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,049
write an article about what kind of

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,149
Singapore participation what comes

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,310
Singapore that's great the rest of you

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,270
you should do it that's what that other

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,850
guy talking in other room okay

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,800
[Music]

00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,420
so when I saw the schedule I thought

00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,180
probably I'll be speaking to the chairs

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,550
and everyone will be in the other rooms

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,250
Google's talking in that room but I'm

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,850
glad you guys are here today for vision

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,130
back because Gutenberg is gonna be it's

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,840
already in the car and there's a lot of

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:19,670
development happening I'm gonna share

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,440
some of that today with you so this is a

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,650
traditional editor what you see is what

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,190
you get but it's not exactly what you

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,960
see is what you get right we have been

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,650
using this for many many years

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,500
and I know the suffering and you know

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,450
the sufferings we suffered together but

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,160
this has been a wonderful editor the

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,190
tiny MC has been there for many years

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,340
and it helped us a lot to get true from

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,490
HTML and plain coding to something that

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,410
you can done to some extent look at this

00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,390
this is a classic editor and I put some

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,700
two pictures there is the durian season

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,330
in Malaysia how many of you are durian

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,890
lovers how many of your head durians say

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,120
these are the Gutenberg and classic

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,120
editor guys so

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,150
so I'm trying to align the images there

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,100
is no columns bit struggling with that

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,300
images finally I got something and I'm

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,190
gonna view when I got this it's not

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,950
exactly what you see is what you get but

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,010
classic editor to some extent it helped

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,230
us a lot and that's where revolution

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,290
happened in WordPress Gutenberg were

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,200
introduced back in 2017 in what come

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,400
Europe by madman were so good and book

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,370
is new revolution in content authoring

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,070
in WordPress all of you have Gutenberg

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,690
so those of some of your race table now

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,450
just now say no idea what I'm talking

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,850
about you actually already own a

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,170
Gutenberg so be proud of it so now I'm

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,030
going to show you how to use a Putin

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,890
work and what kind of things we can get

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,220
done with Gutenberg and what are some of

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,489
the limitation of Gutenberg here let's

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,500
look at this few or new features in

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:05,380
Guttenberg how what you can get done

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,080
first of all post covers you can have

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,630
image or video post cover so this is my

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,110
good in back editor I'm going to add a

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,209
title and then I'm going to put a new

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,130
block this is blocks in the college

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,160
block and I'm searching for cover and

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,169
that's a cover and I want to pick one of

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,710
the images all lovely Dorian images

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,840
there and that's a cover and motion king

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,830
is the best of its class it's like what

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:36,729
pricing compared to all other CMS so

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,010
it's it's now full weight and that's a

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,169
beautiful cover there and I'm going to

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,790
add some text and down there I'm gonna

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,270
do one more cover with a video

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,860
background so it's just few minutes to

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,110
get these beautiful covers for your

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,479
pages now I'm going to add add a short

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,880
video there and this video I took from

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
Singapore YouTube channel so it's

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,419
Singaporean Malaysian durian looks

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,729
slightly different it's much better

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,550
actually

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,850
so it's wider and if you preview it now

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,350
I got a beautiful cow here right and I

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,330
done

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:15,780
this using Gutenberg editor yeah so can

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,780
you do this with classic editor yeah so

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,820
uh let next let's look at some columns

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,910
you can create columns easily with

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,490
Gutenberg now columns are things that

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,400
you want to align multiple object in the

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,290
same line we have suffered with tables

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,780
right usually we use table to put

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,520
different things in the same line and it

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,190
sucks on the mobile devices because

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,930
tables are not responsive so you need to

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,530
work around with your HTML to make it

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,310
responsive so if you are not good in

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,510
HTML

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,640
I don't want ask you how many of you can

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,700
do HTML I can see that now if you're not

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,460
good in HTML then that's a big struggle

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,370
or to do something so I'm just designing

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,100
three boxes there and I'm going to put

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,400
up some contents I'm sorry this video is

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,590
slightly longer so that's it's a

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,910
different dorian in the price i know

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,750
some of you know wondering is that the

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,370
price militia yes it is i do some

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,860
alignment at the same time you can see

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,960
on the right there is property settings

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,420
you can make some customization in

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,310
gutenberg so now i got three boxes with

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,470
three different packs and three price

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,540
text and i align everything to the

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,040
center so i can imagine what will happen

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,760
on the mobile device i apply some

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,760
background colors colors and click that

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,870
yeah so background colors looks much

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,880
better and let's look at this in a

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,640
front-end now this is what I got

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,130
so three columns and let me switch to

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,910
mobile device what we seen about mobile

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,340
device look at it so it's balanced act

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,380
and it's a very responsive view it's

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,390
stacked or mobile I'm just changing to

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,840
latest iPhone acts is that the latest

00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:01,260
device now how is this is an iPhone X so

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,810
it's it's much compatible it is

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,540
responsive in a way that you can control

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,580
how it is aligned so columns is one of

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,190
beautiful feature in Guttenberg a lot of

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,200
people cried when Gutenberg was launched

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,220
because there were no columns and later

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,360
the columns were introduced and

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,540
it's it's much stable social limits one

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,450
example if you're writing a post like

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,910
this you want to embed some Twitter or

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:32,360
Facebook right and you can just put

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,970
that's maybe mine wouldn't work I know I

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,420
just simply pick this tweet to brag

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,660
about it

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,090
so I think that's a Facebook post I just

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,190
copied that URL and put it up click Amen

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,940
so now I got Facebook Twitter and

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:51,080
Facebook post embedded within my article

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,880
and beautiful just feel clicks you don't

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,590
need to use third-party plugins to do

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,010
this probably you have seen such a mess

00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:02,900
in news websites right or any other

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:05,120
online portals if you are still missing

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,070
classic editor in it all the points that

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,830
I've mentioned just now few feature I

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,830
like doesn't convince you and you really

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,960
really missing classic editor now we

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,860
have classic editor block within

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,490
Guttenberg

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:24,560
so you can add classic and here you go

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,750
do whatever you want so it's a it's a

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,220
classic editor within Gooden burg and

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,560
that's what you get so there's no reason

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,750
why we have to switch to classic editor

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,810
and disable Guttenberg other than some

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,590
of the points I'm going to mention next

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,900
let's see what are the features that is

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,550
packaged together in Guttenberg reusable

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,890
blocks let's say you have designed

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,570
something beautifully something like

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,090
this that we did just now

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,850
you can save this so just click there

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,120
and click Add to reusable blocks and

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:05,150
give it a name for example I'm given

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,640
name as my three columns safe that was

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,089
saved now I'm creating a new post a

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,310
brand new post clicking new post and go

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:16,520
and this is a new post I'm going to call

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,610
the reusable block that I saved here it

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,950
is so you can always create some

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,589
templates that you usually use and save

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,260
it and recall it on other pages so

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,320
that's reusable blocks if you have

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,450
designed something

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,940
you can share with your friends or with

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,010
other websites so what you can do is you

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,290
can export this block that you save just

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,770
now and they can import in your website

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,110
so this is how we do it so we go all the

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,840
way to the three dots at end of the page

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,360
and there's a menu with several setting

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,150
manage all blocks and this is the block

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,120
that I saved export as JavaScript

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,950
project notation and then in a new

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,190
website you can click import in the same

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,890
same area so with this you save a lot of

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,380
time by sharing the block so it's not

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,880
just designing and keep it on your

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,230
website you can switch it to a different

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,490
website for the particular blocks a

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,180
block manager is a new feature

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,600
introduced like just months ago it

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,550
allows you to control which blocks are

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,590
enabled in your WordPress and which

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,090
plots are not because sometimes this

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,340
block can be overwhelming because

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,680
there's so many blocks and your content

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,510
author get confused which block to click

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,250
because there's so many blocks so you

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,860
can simply disable some of the blocks

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,820
and enable the blocks that is only

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,680
required for your website for example if

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,630
you go to that setting and block manager

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,880
and you can see there are so many blocks

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,060
so you can disable all on these three

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,800
blocks that you won't be using or you

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,360
don't want other author to use on your

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,760
website and just uncheck and close it so

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,610
now if I go and add a new block on my

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,280
page and under embeds

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,680
so I only see few otherwise you will

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,920
have a long list of some in here man so

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,560
this is a new feature which allow you to

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,410
manage what exactly you want to allow

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:19,590
other people to use on your Gutenberg

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,960
custom CSS this is something cool if you

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:26,550
are like front-end developer or you know

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,850
something - some code to write how to

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,760
write CSS CSS cascading style sheets

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,520
that allow you to style any area of your

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,590
page any element in your page so now

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,600
with the blocks everything is a block

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,060
you can simply style all these blocks

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,760
for example I'm going to

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,550
one CSS for this text block so I click

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,800
on the text block at once and additional

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,660
CSS class I'm going to add my CSS that's

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,790
the class for example I'm going to

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,460
front-end there's a durian website and

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,770
then click on the customize and now in

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:03,800
the additional CSS I'm gonna call my CSS

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:06,470
yeah so it's docked my CSS it's a class

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,840
so I start with dot and and I'm gonna

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,940
just do some CSS and I can see what's

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,520
happening to that content because that

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,240
content has this class right I just had

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,700
it so I'm just writing some design don't

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,010
call this as a code it's not exactly a

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,860
code so it's a property value these

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,050
things are totally fixed so if you don't

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,720
know CSS go back and please learn about

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,520
CSS because in future WordPress

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,830
everything will be the customer either

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,090
so there's no theme settings there's no

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,650
team option in the backend

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,450
there's no BJP's in the backend so

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,630
everything will be in the customizer so

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,890
you will be relying a lot on the CSS so

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,530
this will be very helpful

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,210
I just write full line of prompting

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,540
values here and I got something like

00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:53,210
that so that is the additional CSS in

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,250
Guttenberg these are the flexibilities

00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:02,060
and options you have in Guttenberg and

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:04,970
some extra tips using Guttenberg is you

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,570
you can use slash to insert block so you

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,520
need to go and press + to insert block

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,530
just put slash and just call whatever

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,110
name you want for example Twitter it

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,910
come up to your support markups you can

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,190
use double hashtag and write something

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,700
that will became heading and then you

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:26,030
can use forward what's that what we call

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,690
that you get a quote there and then code

00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,750
to get code blocks and then bullets you

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,060
can use star and then you can use shift

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,350
enter so you don't get a new block but

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,540
you're maintaining the same block

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,380
sometimes when you enter you get a next

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,270
text block right so you can shift enter

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,030
shift alternate edge you can find out a

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,250
lot of keyboard shortcuts how keyword

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,440
shortcuts help in Gutenberg similar to

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,910
we have some shortcuts in classic editor

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,280
right and

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,650
we use a lot of shortcut in different

00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,310
kind software ctrl-c ctrl-v these are

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,900
the basic shortcuts that you use but a

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,730
part of that you have many other

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,750
keyboard shortcuts that you can use in

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,810
Gutenberg you can refer that why you

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,060
should use Google Gutenberg / classic

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,620
editor a Gutenberg is a part of the core

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,600
that means

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,180
WordPress will support booting work

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,000
eventually all themes and plugins need

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,230
to support Gutenberg so you have

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,140
advantage here over any other page

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:35,180
builder if I'm using a page builder for

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:40,250
example WP bakery anyone from WP bakery

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:45,130
here never ever use that

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:48,710
so can we censor this later in the video

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:51,680
so WP bakery is like a bloated with so

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,480
many codes you know I know some of you

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,580
thinking that's the same case with page

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,340
builders right so Gutenberg going to be

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,290
the same case no in the next phase

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,690
they're gonna introduce a sink or solve

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,670
it I think I think if you are using some

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,370
blocks on that page it will load that

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,280
particular JavaScript if not it won't

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,980
load so it's not like one package of

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,170
JavaScript loaded on all pages so these

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,210
are the some plants are coming out for

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,210
Gutenberg less plugins to manage

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,730
everything will be blocked or interred

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,160
in future like down the road next three

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,260
years you will see less and less plugins

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,330
in the plugins store and more and more

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,200
blocks so you just install blocks and

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,540
you don't need to manage so many plugins

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,070
blocks are not easy to develop I know

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,040
there's a learning curve because it's

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,990
based on react native and you need to

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,840
learn react native to develop new blocks

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,480
if your programmer I mean if you're

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,640
already using react native I had some

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,160
very useful conversation around what

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,880
come Singapore today I found some of you

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,680
already creating your own blocks

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,230
Gutenberg has been developed very

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,420
actively in the past three years we got

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,150
more than 10,000 commits and more than

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,840
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:13,020
releases and be got to star for the

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:15,540
plugins yay it's simply it's not a bad

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,400
thing white people are using classic

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,560
editable Guttenberg is most probably

00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,960
they're using outdated team so the team

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,230
doesn't support Gutenberg editor so they

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,490
have to use classic editor so if you are

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,800
new to WordPress and you want to use

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,440
great pages and contents I strongly

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,180
recommend use Gutenberg our classic

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,030
editor classic editor will be retiring

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,370
in 2021 so there's two more year to

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,250
support it after 22 any one you have to

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,380
use good and work okay so it's I'm

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,830
begging you now to use but later on I

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:55,530
don't you have to use it so just kidding

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:57,180
so Gutenberg is a very actively

00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,910
developed this is the road map for

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,280
Gutenberg you can see I think function

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,680
is here this charged the menu block

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,060
there's one project or I mean separately

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,010
or working on the menu block for

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,630
Gutenberg so soon we will have menu

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,540
block you can add menu anywhere on your

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,790
page so it will be like any other

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,480
commercial page builder you have out

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,550
there but remember I don't tell that

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,500
Gutenberg is as good as commercial page

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,420
builder like element or any other page

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,030
builder because the purpose of Gutenberg

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,220
is for content authoring not to design

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,290
your pages if you want to have beautiful

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,350
design and you want to add all sort of

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:38,300
commercial elements bloated page that

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:42,720
load in 30 seconds go ahead use any comp

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,840
page builders because the objective here

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,710
is to make content authors easier for

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,400
them to design content pages without

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,860
much effort without working with codes

00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,170
you remember how we add tables in

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:03,170
classic editor how do we do that

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,170
painfully

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,820
Braca table brackets and TR th and and

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,160
all sort of things some of them have no

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,500
idea what I'm talking about it's okay so

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,300
that's how we do tables in Goten what

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,740
they already have table block building

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:24,010
it's just not very responsive it's just

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,660
tables you can style the tables we have

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:32,590
buttons we have a lot of other things in

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:35,860
this Gutenberg coming up I have designed

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,320
a website Gutenberg gotta meet mine and

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,480
I put some demo pages there so if you go

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,100
to this website lick this demo you can

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,040
see all the pages that I've demonstrated

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,160
just now from this website there's

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,980
something called fronting bar if you

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,780
click rothenburg you can use gutenberg

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,940
right away without the word price so if

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,440
you think that you don't want to have

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,450
Gutenberg now you just want to play

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,520
around that's a playground just click on

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,400
front and work and play around and see

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,500
how it works so it just probably take 10

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,200
to 15 minutes to learn how good you work

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:14,610
work for you with that thank you so much

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:19,810
if you have any questions

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,810
[Applause]

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:50,460
so you mean saving the whole page has a

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:56,330
template saying that my mind like to

00:19:50,460 --> 00:20:02,460
make some with Sables so can they use

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:06,930
within my with in elementary mean yeah

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,300
no no so you can only use better because

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,410
the the how the output of HTML is

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,600
totally different

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:16,020
what price try to keep the output of

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,420
HTML close to the HTML and other company

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,890
have their own standard on naming

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,510
convention

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:27,530
some companies good block editor will

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:31,310
only work within certain environment so

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:34,350
therefore you can't cross use it but

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:37,140
like reusable block is something like

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,750
that so you can save reusable block or

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,760
some one other thing that we have in

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,440
Guttenberg is if you look at this at the

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,300
end if you click the menu at the end

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,580
there is something called copy

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,560
everything so you can copy everything on

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,710
your page and paste you know some other

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,200
 but at this moment you can't cross

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,680
this good and work with other page

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
builders

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,010
good question so what happened is that

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:09,340
in the 5.0 of the classic editor we

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,160
removed and it comes with Gutenberg by

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,250
default so wouldn't work we'll try to

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,690
convert your content to the blahs so

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,270
most probably you will get a lot of

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,570
bunch of text blocks or one text block

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:26,290
with everything in it so it's depend how

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,420
your content were created earlier that

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,540
definitely requires some works if you

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:35,470
want to convert into different blocks

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:38,830
but if you have so much of changes I'll

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,420
suggest you can always use you can

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,190
always switch between Gutenberg and

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,770
classic editor so those are all pages

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,390
you can switch classic editor just

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,460
activate the plug-in to edit that pages

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,490
but when you're composing new page use

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,950
Gutenberg I know you knew the answer and

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,150
it's it's the FAQ he's trying to

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,530
highlight here

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,510
so you can always switch between good

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,100
and work and classic editor if you're

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,960
editing the old pages that you already

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,780
done just switch to classic editor and

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,400
do it so you don't need to go through a

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,760
painful process to convert it into

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,050
Gutenberg blogs but all new pages moving

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,550
forward you can quit in Gutenberg editor

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,550
you can have both in your website it

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:37,500
doesn't require reacted without having

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,730
to use react as far as I know no but I

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,780
don't know if there anybody have a

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:47,900
better answer yes question or that

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,900
service yes question oh I thought sorry

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,610
okay I'll come to that so just before

00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:04,410
that let me process into my left brain

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:06,780
so so to answer that it's on the react

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,240
for some reasons because we are there

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:13,590
right now they're implementing autosave

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,450
function as well so custom fields yeah

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,130
there is custom fields as well I in

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,870
Gutenberg you can go to the most setting

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,870
and you can enable custom fields or

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,669
yeah I'm strongly like don't recommend

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,909
to use third-party plugins to create

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:44,120
another block so you can always go to

00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:47,630
react because if you remember Matt

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,450
Mullen works called few years back learn

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,299
JavaScript deeply JavaScript the future

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,429
so you three have to create blocks if

00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,529
you're really into creating blocks okay

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,250
to come for your questions about bad

00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,929
reviews it's it's very hard when I was

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,570
in what come Europe this year some

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:07,159
people just um too mad Milan work and

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:11,539
ask all these sort of questions why are

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:14,480
you into these days and why is that it's

00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,610
the way I see things is that this is a

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,649
great change

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,510
if WordPress have no Gutenberg most

00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:22,070
probably down the road in two years or

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,020
three years people will be starting to

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,529
move into other platforms such as bigs

00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,630
or other platform medium you know Google

00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:32,690
work is pretty much similar to medium

00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,110
editor right so pretty much all content

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,600
authoring use block editors except

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,039
WordPress Joomla Drupal using

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,659
traditional what-you-see-is-what-you-get

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:47,059
editor so this is a revolution and when

00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:50,630
when WordPress introduced is a lot of

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:52,429
bad comments because all developers it

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,190
put a big burden on developers they need

00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:58,159
to make sure their teams and plugins now

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:01,580
compatible with Guttenberg so that's

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,260
where the whole things comes up but you

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,370
I can see there's a lot of improvement

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:10,190
now compared to 2017-2018

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,380
now 2019 wouldn't work it's much more

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:16,309
stable so you can imagine what will

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,929
happen next three years so one way they

00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,830
overcome this bad reviews is by giving

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:20,830
talking what comes

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:36,190
okay any other questions yes correct the

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,649
best way to find this out is read the

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,880
description of the plugins

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,779
only the plug-in developer can tell you

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,370
whether its work with Gutenberg or not

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:50,519
it's no way for us to find out other

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,519
than the good amount they prepare

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:04,600
actually heard saying that the late

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:20,350
developer edit on ence has decided to

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:22,600
join the Gutenberg Project I don't have

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:26,889
any information on that I heard rumors

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,659
about addition but there's a lot of

00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:32,559
people working on Gutenberg right now we

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:34,779
have 453 developers for Conan so the

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,519
contribution comes from different ends

00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,549
including the classic editor tangency

00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,379
and all other editors just before I end

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,659
I just want to flash to most lives

00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:46,570
what can call it empower coming up on

00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:48,909
this November feel free to join webcam

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,789
Kuala Lumpur is happening in budget

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:56,110
Times Square Kuala Lumpur and we have

00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:59,049
