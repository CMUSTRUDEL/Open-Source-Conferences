howdy all right thanks

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,730
[Applause]

00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:10,769
all right so this is a pretty big topic

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,030
for ten minutes but we'll see how much

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,350
we can cover together so here's here's

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,300
what we're gonna talk about I think when

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,070
most people think about WordPress in

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,320
media they usually think about the media

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,510
gallery which looks something like this

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,699
so we're gonna be talking a little bit

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,680
more about what happens before your

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,689
image ends up there so when it's kind of

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,160
you know spinning like this inside

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,190
Guttenberg and it's uploading or you

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,510
drag it into the media modal and so

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,000
we're gonna be talking about sort of

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,670
that process that happens in the middle

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,140
between there so after you drag an image

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,469
when you're waiting for it

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,530
WordPress uses plupload to handle that

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,960
upload and plupload handles all that

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,660
sort of middleware between between your

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,860
browser and the image itself and

00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,539
WordPress but it doesn't do anything

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,940
with the image itself it just serves the

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,049
full-size image directly to WordPress

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,299
and then it lands it visually it lands

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,710
it in the media gallery that we saw

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,380
earlier but what's it doing while it's

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,979
uploading the main thing that takes the

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,369
most time are sizes and what I mean by

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:20,280
that are different like resizes of the

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,310
same image by default the ones that are

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,890
created by WordPress are thumbnail

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,110
small/medium medium/large large and full

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,079
the full one is just the the entire

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,720
image that gets uploaded and mainly what

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,670
this means is different sizes in

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,290
resolution and so that's mainly for for

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,259
both caching so that WordPress already

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,110
has a an image of that size to serve and

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,770
also so that it can provide your browser

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,720
with a series of sizes for responsive

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,390
images with source set so that your

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,759
browser can pick the image that's most

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,030
appropriate for the user in that

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,549
particular instance other folks also so

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,799
plug-ins and themes can add additional

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,200
sizes to the ones that WordPress

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
generates for art direction or for

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,119
different resolution reasons so if they

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,629
if you

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,180
would want an image to be both presented

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,890
in as like a logo but also somewhere

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,599
else in your site and maybe like an

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,849
about page you could use the same

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,430
initial original image and have it just

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:27,959
cropped a little bit differently

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,579
automatically by WordPress at this time

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,750
underneath now this is a superlight sort

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,840
of description of the way that this

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,400
works so so pardon me with that but

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,190
there's a function that it's called WP

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,709
generate attachment metadata and it does

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,510
a lot of processing of the image but one

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:48,370
of the things that it has is a big long

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,410
call inside it to a multi function

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,459
called multi resize which takes the

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,379
image and then does a big set of resizes

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,530
just in succession just in order all of

00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:02,170
the sizes all at once and this is

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,220
actually an instance of WP image editor

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,769
if you're interested in a little bit

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,680
more of the details rather than being a

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,220
method but this is basically how that

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,400
works how it happens

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:20,019
so WP image editor the actual thing then

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,389
calls either a magic or GD by default

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,590
and although if you're a developer and

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:25,510
you want to provide a different image

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,250
backend to WordPress to be able to do

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,980
the sizes a different way you can

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,590
totally also do that so by default the

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,660
engine that's used is a magic which uses

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,590
image magic if you do a lot of image

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,150
manipulation some folks I get hats

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,340
pretty frequently why this is sort of

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,519
useless as the default in core and why

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,790
sort of this was chosen the main reason

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,269
is that especially when it was first

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,910
added it's kind of the most universally

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,150
available solution across different

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,099
hosts that I know of even still to be

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,340
able to manipulate images and do it with

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,540
detail GD allows you to do resizes for

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,489
instance but doesn't allow you to go

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,699
more in depth so some of the things that

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:16,269
we were able to add as a community to

00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:18,039
WordPress by adding by starting to use a

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,840
magic so if your host supports a magic

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,940
this is a good thing to check you can

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,630
check it with the the new site health

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,980
feature

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,090
in WordPress you can go

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,380
and it'll tell you whether it's

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,620
supported or not by your host if you

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,840
want to check later is one of them is

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,180
color profiles and I hope this shows up

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,120
well on the screen but so if you have a

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,240
custom profile for an image that isn't

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,920
just srgb and you upload it it might

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,480
look something like this I think this

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,890
one was an Adobe RGB image that I

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,080
uploaded to Gd and GD isn't able to save

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,850
color profiles so your image might the

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,760
resizes the other size this might end up

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,320
looking a little funny however if you

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,940
used a magic with this exact same image

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,470
you'd end up with some colors that are a

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,780
little bit more accurate for the

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,350
original image so that's one of the

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,590
things that can do we're also able to in

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,550
WordPress 4.5 reduce the sizes of image

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:15,220
huge hugely so the total size of images

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,510
that your user will download from the

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,840
sizes that are generated were able to go

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,880
down up to 50% because with the magic

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,970
rail to be like a lot more specific both

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,830
on what information stays in the image

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,470
and also how the compression works and

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,030
this we were able to do this without

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,550
changing visually the way that it looks

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,400
to users at all which is pinch is pretty

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,340
cool another thing that it allows you to

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,680
do a magic supports a lot more file

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,000
types so one of the things that it can

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,340
do is handle now as a wordpress 4.7 so

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,110
this is still a little bit ago this is

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,830
where the PDF thumbnails come from so

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,140
only a magic can handle that and if you

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,360
wanted to you do other profiles a lot of

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,480
servers support a ton of different or a

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,820
different formats I mean a lot of

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,440
servers support many many different file

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,110
formats with the magic and image magic

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,430
and you can write code that will allow

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,990
you to parse that you're not blocked

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,150
from doing so

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,160
from doing operations basic operations

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,390
on images for any file type of your

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,890
system supports so that's a thing that

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:23,260
you can do absolutely the magic is also

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,350
a bit kind of run resources which takes

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,720
us to the next part of the talk

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,250
limitations so there are some

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,860
limitations with the way that the system

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,360
currently works maybe you've seen this

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,939
before I mean

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,150
I hope not all the time but it's a thing

00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:43,120
that happens there's been some work to

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,409
avoid it but the biggest problem with

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,379
the way that images currently get

00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:51,069
generated is that they are all generated

00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:53,319
in one HTTP request and as plugins and

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:58,750
themes add more and more sizes and also

00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:00,219
as as images get larger this is becomes

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,409
more and more likely to either timeout

00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:07,509
or for your system - for the server that

00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:11,319
it's on to run out of resources so if it

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,460
does timeout right now your original

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,289
image will end up in your media library

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,699
the one that you uploaded but none of

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,909
the sizes will show up and WordPress

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,979
won't even know they exist so that's

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:24,159
kind of a problem when we talk about

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:26,650
resources what I'm mainly talking about

00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,240
is processor time which is in effect

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,409
about the amount of time that you're

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,319
just waiting to if you want to think

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,909
about it that way and memory one of the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,979
things that it's a little bit more

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,770
difficult with Gd when it's resizing

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,139
images as far as resources go is that it

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,210
requires that the entire image be

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,430
uncompressed in memory while it's doing

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,250
all of its operations the magic does not

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,080
so if your hosts especially if it's a

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,120
shared host supports a magic then you're

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
a lot more likely to have your the

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,259
requests completed if you're using a

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,419
magic so that's another cool thing and

00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,729
of course as images get larger and

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,139
larger now we're seeing phone images be

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,379
the size of what used to just be

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,479
professional professional camera sort of

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,819
sizes and resolutions it becomes more

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,120
and more likely that that might that you

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,919
might run out of resources so that's

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,639
that's one issue another one is that

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,199
it's not dynamic so the reason that it's

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,560
done the way that it is right now is

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,779
because doing it in a dynamic fashion

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,909
might take too much time to generate

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:31,150
those images for all the users and so

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:34,329
especially with shared hosting it's it's

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,029
you're less likely to be able to have

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:39,909
those sizes delivered on time and

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,490
quickly to users but it also makes it

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,980
harder so if you have one just one page

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,970
that needs a different size for instance

00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,210
you don't want to have to generate all

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,490
those sizes for

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,890
every single image that you upload and

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,770
so it's a little bit harder to to get

00:08:51,890 --> 00:09:00,020
exactly what you want or just an image

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:02,330
on demand so the current state is not

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,779
really the best date all of this won't

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,830
be fixed in WordPress 5.3 but let's talk

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,760
about a few things that are on the

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,839
roadmap so the very first thing and this

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,130
is kind of the one I'm most excited

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,390
about is safe state so now as the

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,430
different sizes get generated so right

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,330
now we're ready in course is assuming we

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,589
don't end up the general disclaimer

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,570
these are things that I hope will be

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,130
finished but you never really know what

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,740
bugs are gonna come up during during

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,120
alpha beta and RC so we'll see but these

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,709
are some things I really hope we'll end

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,529
up in in WordPress this is one that has

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:40,190
already landed in in trunk so it's kind

00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:42,589
of the most likely so right now in trunk

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,870
already WordPress is able to save as it

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:47,510
generates images into meta each of those

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,610
images and what that means basically is

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,589
that each as WordPress is making those

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,070
sizes it remembers that it's already

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:59,900
done it because previously it did not so

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:03,440
it's able to add it we're now able to

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,570
add a feature to resume or detect that

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
it has failed and then retry and not

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,170
start from the beginning previously the

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,550
only way to for a user to really recover

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,260
would be just to kind of keep uploading

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,500
and kind of hoping it's gonna work that

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,600
time which is really really really bad

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,800
user experience so I'm excited about

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,860
this one the next one is the idea of

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,230
having sort of a gold master in and full

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,089
changing what it means so at the moment

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,890
you do basically have a gold master in

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,770
that you're and what I mean by gold

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,779
master is a file that is exactly the

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,790
same as the original image that you

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,620
uploaded I think it's important to

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,810
always have that upload it on your site

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,370
so that if in the future you need

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,899
additional sizes or you're gonna do

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,380
something different with your site you

00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,270
can WordPress can get those can create

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,070
those images from the original source so

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,500
a really one example of that is when

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,690
you're switching themes it might the new

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,400
theme might require different sizes in

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,990
the original one so it's really good to

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,750
have that to have that source

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,330
that's there but at the moment the way

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,770
that it works you might have the source

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:13,980
image served as as just an image on the

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,830
site if your if a device is requesting a

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,480
resolution that is higher than the sizes

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,070
that WordPress generates and that's not

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,260
ideal because your original image

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,200
probably has some things inside it like

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,330
thumbnails and data that makes the image

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
large enough that you don't really want

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:34,530
that to be served so the idea is to

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,290
change that the next one is to add back

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,180
so many years ago there were details on

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,430
what HTTP error meant now you get no

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,200
information the idea is to add that back

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,730
there's a really there's a cool patch

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,190
from that that fixes this from Rome own

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,490
thinkin and I'm pretty excited about

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,570
that I'm hoping that can make it in

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,620
another thing that's being discussed is

00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,360
to maybe add some more sizes the large

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,310
that is currently that is currently

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,030
there isn't that large the default

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,130
WordPress size and so often that also

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,660
results in the full makes it more likely

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,250
that the full size is going to be served

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,590
so because we want to always serve the

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,950
smallest image possible to users this is

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,620
something that is possible be that we

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,240
couldn't do before because we were

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,950
worried about adding more sizes and

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,830
making it more likely to fail for users

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,420
but is now possible because WordPress

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,770
can remember what it's done essentially

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:34,110
if you want to see more details or are

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,510
interested in helping out which would be

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,820
super great you can check out this post

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,440
from Andrew woz about some important

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,220
image Tekkit tickets on make

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,440
wordpress.org / core or also there's a

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,150

come chat with me I would love to help

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:55,400
you get connected and that is it does

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
anyone have any questions

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,110
[Applause]

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:12,450
it doesn't just have to be about images

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,200
- yeah that's also true you can ask me

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,670
about coffee

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,670
happy to chat about coffee

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,439
good morning I may have three questions

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:33,339
alone the first one yes so by default

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:35,410
WordPress images the move press please I

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:37,959
see three or four different sizes right

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,309
correct yeah so how do you stop that

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,949
from happening that's the first business

00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:57,819
because it's fancy you know you just

00:13:41,949 --> 00:14:02,529
want the single sizing sizing okay can I

00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:04,209
answer the first one first so the so yes

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,730
you can change it I don't remember the

00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,529
filter name off the top of my head but

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,300
there is a there's a filter that you can

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:12,459
use in WordPress and you can change what

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,399
those sizes are so absolutely if if

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,439
what's best for your site is not that

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,759
then that's cool I generally don't

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,670
recommend that folks that don't have a

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,189
team working on it do that because then

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,889
that disables the if you're not using

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:28,689
either the sizes from your theme being

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,939
generated or the default image sizes

00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:32,829
then WordPress doesn't have anything to

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,660
serve except for the original for

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,329
responsive images and so you lose all of

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,100
that bandwidth savings that you would

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,899
end up with if you if you disable it

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,269
entirely and aren't like using another

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,220
method to have your your responsive

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,899
images needs sort of taken care of but

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,290
yes absolutely there's a filter and you

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:53,639
can you can disable it or add sizes or

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,639
whatever you would like for sure

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,180
very early so especially comes to

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,880
loading big images and all that so my

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,860
question is that what is the recommended

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,360
like like Google Google is using back

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,640
please how much you know there it's

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,450
almost beats loading with it so what

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,820
sort method

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,590
I mean if just your site puts hosting

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,640
multiple if he doesn't know that

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:23,180
what is your recommended way of I mean

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:25,600
what what so what do you recommend to be

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,600
doing

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,889
I'm not sure I hundred-percent

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,630
understand the question

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,310
WordPress doesn't use web P because it's

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,350
not supported very widely across

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,940
browsers there has been talk about

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,470
supporting it in the future and there's

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,800
a patch that you can look at if you want

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,170
to try and use that on your site right

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,480
now I mean most of my recommendations

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,279
for sort of the general user would be a

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,440
lot of them are reflected in the way

00:15:49,279 --> 00:16:03,430
that that WordPress handles images but

00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:03,430
I'm not so I'm not sure for speed

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:13,940
I guess so there are various tools that

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,370
you can use to sort of minify or images

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,000
more in the general case I have a hard

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,160
time recommending any particular thing

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,649
because I think everyone's site works a

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,589
little bit differently WordPress does

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,779
its best to to sort of make those images

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,569
as small as it can right now and I think

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,370
as as far as sort of general users go I

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:36,769
would recommend using WordPress the way

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,290
that it's the way that it's set up but

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,360
if you want to go further and and do

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,670
more you know manual optimization of

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,120
images then I think whatever is best for

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,790
your site is whatever recommend I don't

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,500
have any specifics like services I don't

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,769
have any specific services that I would

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,769
recommend

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:09,230
for what I'm sorry for oh I am NOT an

00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:10,490
SEO expert so I don't I don't think I

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:44,390
don't think I'm qualified to answer that

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:46,280
question while I'm sorry so what's the

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,900
best way to identify what those

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,559
unattached images are because I've

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:55,510
always found the media library call

00:17:50,559 --> 00:18:04,580
unreliable so how would you suggest try

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:06,950
finding unattached is the right way yeah

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,510
I don't think that there's a I'm trying

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,340
to remember if there's a good user

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,260
interface option for that I don't think

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,020
I don't think there is a really good

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,559
user interface option I think you could

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,330
probably do if I were supporting a user

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,299
and needed to sort of mass fix a problem

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,549
like that I might look into making a WPC

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,080
Li script or just running WPC Li and

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,820
checking the meta on the images to see

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,990
what to see what they're attached to

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,059
maybe but yeah I don't think that

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,400
there's a good sort of in use as far as

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,140
I am remembering correctly I don't think

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,679
that there's a good like way to do it

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,760
visually for users right now yeah I

00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,650
would love to chat with you more about

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,330
that specifically because there's a lot

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,000
of conversation around how attachment

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,919
should work in in images and how they

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,450
should be connected or not connected to

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,409
post in the future so I would love to

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,320
chat with you more about it

00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,030
