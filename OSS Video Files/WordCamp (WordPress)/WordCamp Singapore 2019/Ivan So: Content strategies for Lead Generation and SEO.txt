hi guys money

00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,660
yeah I'm Ivan from Hong Kong a lot of

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,480
people actually talk to me not because

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,389
of WordPress recently so but I'm talking

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm talking about WordPress here all

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,260
right

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,380
ok let's begin so a really brief bio

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,529
that I'm using WordPress since 15 years

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,019
ago because I use WordPress to test like

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,460
the SEO aspect or for the website and

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,010
I'd be like 1550s I in order to test the

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,090
SEO in the WordPress and some of them

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,090
actually went quite well

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,450
I accessed some of their site 10 years

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,989
ago and reason I have a wordpress agency

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,149
which be 350s I were present will come

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,110
aside for customer and optimizations as

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:55,260
well so I like to do a lot of repair

00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:00,059
stuff so that's why I also organized in

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,420
Hong Kong do webcam right and also I did

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,850
publish some books in in Amazon and is I

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,640
got lucky I got on the top and there's

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,400
some strategy as well if you want to

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,760
learn later on so today's topics it's

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,689
about the content strategy how I could I

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,020
could do one content and publish to 515

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,299
channel and base a concept for the neat

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,030
generation as well as the SEO stuff

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,780
which I I'm more passionate about and

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,840
this exact strategy I used a few minutes

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,640
ago I already have our agency to do

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,650
repair stuff but I launched another one

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:45,570
for consultancy business I'd use as well

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:51,720
to reach this amend recently so the idea

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:54,570
the idea for sm SME like myself to voice

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,820
out to more people the branding or what

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,890
we offer is difficult because we do not

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,310
have a lot of projects like the big guy

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,700
so what i do is i want you make good use

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,640
of a one single content to multiplies it

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,160
in order to reach our more people so the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,110
entire idea is to reach her

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,520
two more people in different channel

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:20,580
with one source of content so this is

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,790
what I do basically I have a channel

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,490
because I'm doing online course and in

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,430
the education stuff so I do a video and

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,760
then I put that video in Facebook

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,260
YouTube and linking of course because

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,060
Facebook and linking actually embrace

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,790
video more which means they give you

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,010
more boost up to two which are the

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,060
audience and then those are three

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,790
different performer and then I go to

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,460
fire or other platform to ask someone to

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,520
transcribe because I actually speak

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,340
Cantonese in Hong Kong which is harder

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,260
to find people to transcribe I use those

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,500
platform and then I transcribe into a

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,690
blog post which is what we are used for

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,620
the WordPress and the other one is that

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,950
I use a platform I use a Tucson line

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,990
which I can I can convert YouTube into

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,440
mp3 and then I use a free platform

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:19,440
called anchor and it will automatically

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,690
upload to the App or Google or Spotify

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,600
podcasts so this is how I use it as as a

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:30,240
solopreneur or SME business that from

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,510
one single video into five different

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,150
channels and because of WordPress

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:41,870
I could transcribe into it tax which you

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:45,540
can attract traffic in the SEO aspect so

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,660
in order to do video it is actually

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,370
quite easy in the past I I want to make

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,930
it more professional now I really don't

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,610
care I just take the phone and then I

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,709
just do it anyway I can do it here

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,770
together with you guys live if you want

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,290
you so in the past because I don't have

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,100
a studio I don't have a great budget

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,340
what I do is that I turn my rest room

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,770
from my home into a studio right that's

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,530
simple so I bought something in Tomball

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,820
our curtain which is green and then I

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,489
bought something like this

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,370
a light for Kol ray and then our user

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:22,800
app which can take out the green stuff

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,220
and then turn in other colors so I can

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,860
give you like a few

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,130
seconds of what my video would actually

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,120
looks like to get a general idea what

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:36,790
you could do from your restroom

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,620
right is in Cantonese but you can see

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,820
that it looks professional right I don't

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,130
have the lighting I don't have other

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,040
stuff it's just the app I use in my

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,740
iPhone and then change the background to

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,690
something else it looks professional but

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,210
now I don't care I just do it anywhere

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,890
the reason I do it at home is that I

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,280
just want to wake up and do it I don't

00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,350
want to you know schedule studio or do

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,020
things like that it takes time so I just

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,710
want to make myself easier in order to

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,690
spread on more content because obviously

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,140
you need to know your position of your

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,060
business or your as a person that

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,480
obviously I am not selling you because

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,850
of my hair style Rae definitely not

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,580
right so I'm not selling you with the

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,620
video quality Rae so I'm selling the

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,660
value which is the most important stuff

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,730
I'm talking about from the content

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,740
itself in the video about digital

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,010
marketing stuff a co-star what WordPress

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,590
stuff so as long as you know where's

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,310
your value is you don't care other stuff

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,070
right just make it simple so the other

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,919
concept I would like to do is lead

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,660
generation concept it could go along

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,300
along but I will just make it really

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,250
simple so represents a lot so far

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,410
different pokken which make it easier

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,400
you can turn your WordPress site into

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,460
different landing page and as a landing

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,590
page or lead generation page the idea is

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,530
you want people to go through your page

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,040
and then perform certain action you want

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:11,140
them to in other word that if you have a

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,870
normal website you normally have like a

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,110
menu or other different story it will

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,270
distract the users from what you want

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,729
them to see but a landing pages that you

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,220
do not have a menu at all you just have

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,800
very specific message or image or

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:32,740
headline that to tempt them to do only

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,349
one thing at a time a quick sample would

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,260
be something like this so they go to a

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,300
page

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,710
you tell them to tangle or something and

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,990
then you collect something from that

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,800
it's a fair deal is this exchange for

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,380
the email or the content and the idea of

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,200
a neat generation is something for into

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,680
what we call a funnel so basically you

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,560
put traffic's in the reason I do the

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,390
content multiplication strategy is that

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,790
I want to reach more people and then I

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,920
want to throw more traffic's into the

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,560
top of it which is a traffic's and then

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,960
I can qualify the lease and then at the

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,360
end of the day it would go to they will

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,970
become my customer so it will go to

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,000
something like this maybe in your funnel

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,530
it may involve more SAP but at the end

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,460
of the day you still need to have

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,860
traffic's and qualify the lease so

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,940
besides the traffic's the other

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,490
important thing will be the conversion

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,460
if you throw a lot of the customer into

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,690
your website but if your conversion rate

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,670
is only like one percent so you can put

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,500
a lot of budget or money for the

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,750
advertising for the traffic's but it

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,820
doesn't really help for you to capture

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,130
the business or convert them to your

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,620
customer so conversion rate is another

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,810
thing which you do not need a lot of

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,200
traffic's but you can also get a good

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,570
money for from the customer so

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,190
conversion is more like what you want

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:06,440
them to do by step by step and this is

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,920
just another example similar to that one

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,460
you want them to do a specific action on

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,140
your page instead of they they go around

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:20,360
navigate around other page of your site

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:23,180
so just quick question if if you are me

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,010
how do you attract people to submit the

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,330
information because some people they're

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,080
actually quite concerned over the

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:34,099
privacy so in one basic answer will be

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,490
giving something free right it's hard to

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:41,000
resist right but the free value has to

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,849
be has to be high enough for them to

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,460
give up or give you their personal

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,900
information or email or number or the

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,600
name so there's some ID

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,870
yes of what you could actually give oh

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,310
for free no matter what business you

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:02,940
actually run it could be for worship or

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,280
for like coupons or or ebook or webinar

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,770
or could be a physical product if you

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:15,510
require the address so some figure that

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:18,600
I used a few months ago I actually asked

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,610
them to fill in the email I got about

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,700
thousand two hundred forty from email

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,860
and I got and at the top here that is

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,490
actually something what I call what push

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,110
not sure you you guys familiar with this

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,810
when you go to a website it will pop up

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,970
something like do you do you want to

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,280
receive like a push notification from

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,470
your browser from your crew if you click

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,930
yes which you do not give up your email

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,980
right it's just pop up from your browser

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,620
it is for those who are very concerned

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,950
about the privacy so I reach our people

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,080
from the email from the browser and from

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,270
the Facebook as well I put them like a

00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,090
little chat bot in the Facebook fan page

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,430
so when people they say hi to you

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,760
the automatic subscribe and then you can

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,980
plus things to them if you do that two

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,530
years ago recently they change every a

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,380
little bit you need to be careful when

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,480
you do that if you if you start to think

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,130
about that alright so the other main

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
thing I'm going to talk about will be

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,210
the SEO so you need traffic's different

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,760
sorts of traffic's you need to increase

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,200
the rich in order to put people to your

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,720
website your landing page and then

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,390
convert people to become your customer

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,710
so the big part to me will be the SEO

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:40,140
and WordPress by far is the most SEO

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,960
friendly content management system in

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,110
the group so if you use a right parking

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,180
do some settings you will be done in

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,860
like this technical SEO path in life

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,520
further minutes it would be a lot easier

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,920
to use it with WordPress so not sure

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,270
this is a stupid question or not so how

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,190
does it work

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,720
basically just a single sentence if

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,950
they're still just me no relevancy and

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,839
paparazzi in technical terms mr. key

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:14,610
works the content itself which which

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,610
consists of different combination of key

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,770
works and the links links is like the

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:25,430
backlinks and then internal links which

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:30,990
are crucial and hard to get as well so

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:34,410
anyone know this guy X go go see yo Eric

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:37,649
which he was in interview by by reporter

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,800
that that we product keep pushing him to

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,500
ask how many what are the reasons for my

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,540
website to rank up and sign and

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:49,529
eventually he is labelled that there's a

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,180
200 what we call ranking factor to to

00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:54,360
make a website to rank on the first page

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,399
on art and you do not need to know 200

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,990
of them maybe like 30 of them they stay

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:04,770
for long and those are more more

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:08,130
importantly a framework of it and and

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:12,029
Google actually change a lot for what

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,829
they show recently so this is a search

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,730
search engine result page for the

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:19,980
desktop surely you guys know it goes for

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,899
the title links and description and then

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,440
the site link wray some of them they

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:29,579
don't have site link citing are those

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,470
little things here if your content have

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,899
install some plug-in it will be

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,990
automatic be up there and you have a

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:41,190
higher exposure for people to click on

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,709
your contents and for mobile I remember

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,529
like three months again they put

00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,660
something like this some in coffey for

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,520
icon which the result page should look a

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,800
little bit different but a lot of people

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,540
did not actually use that they just put

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,070
their letters in and it's quite hard to

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,560
tell the later

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,410
this is actually my website and I have

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,940
no logo at all so I just put an arrow so

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,860
make people think this is a link you

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,990
should click on it so it's you know it's

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,570
it's like a kind of little little

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,100
strategy that because it's weird that

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,050
it's more like a psychology

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,480
if I point you something you guys will

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,820
look at that right if I look at a thing

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,220
you will follow where I look at race so

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:24,180
it's more like a action I want you to

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:27,330
follow because if luckily or unluckily

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,210
you click on my link once I will

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:35,100
retarget you with s so that's another

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:38,640
thing so from from a lot of website I

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,090
have been serving roughly there's about

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,300
70% of the website they actually using

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:48,690
using mobile device but I still see a

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,370
lot of website design agency when they

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,680
do the design they actually start from

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,870
desktop and I have no idea why they do

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,640
that they give you a design for desktop

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,550
but that's only surfing for like 30

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,950
represented people right so if you want

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,810
to plan your website or strategy in

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,890
WordPress you should actually put more

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:14,100
effort in the mobile now instead of from

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:16,050
the desktop and another thing is meta

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,880
keywords and anyone have meta keywords

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,240
you guys know what you smell occurs

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:26,340
right okay you guys put meta keywords in

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,740
your website no okay good because it no

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,380
longer use since 10 years ago but I

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,160
still see people putting meta keywords

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,820
in their website is useful

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,130
no it is harmful probably not but what

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,970
do you put it there if it is useless all

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,820
right

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,090
Google's had 10 years ago they didn't

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,300
use it Google saw Google Yahoo saw

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,090
Google actually an ancestor they follow

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:58,560
but some guy actually find out that they

00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,930
still do but now they shouldn't bet it

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,030
will it was some 10 years ago and being

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,640
wasn't using that as well if you use it

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,650
wrongly in the metadata it will become

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,820
something called spam signal it will

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:13,200
make it even worse so the other thing I

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,330
would like to talk about would be the

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,820
Google algorithm I'm not going to talk

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,640
abut of it mainly on those

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,350
the mobile and the rent brain so in four

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,680
years ago they launched two big

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:29,340
algorithm update basically google

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,570
updates their algorithms about to 200

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,910
times per day now so you do not you do

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,310
not need to worry about too much because

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,310
some of them they are they're minor so

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,590
in 2015 they launched algorithm for

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,570
mobile which is very important of course

00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,660
the other one is brain brain which is

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:53,240
the first AI tip learning algorithm for

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:57,180
large scale of search engine like this

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,820
so what it does is that it becomes a

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,920
brain for the google search engine they

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,770
they will understand what you search and

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,050
your intention behind your search in

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,690
order to give you the result this is how

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,090
it how they do it and you cannot do

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,730
something bad in order to trick Google

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:21,060
to run your site anymore because of that

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:24,060
as well so how do i how do I know Google

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,300
actually find my website or they will

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,420
rank my website so I want you to take my

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,490
phone out and and have a test and not

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,700
just for take a picture have tried try

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,940
it on your own can you type like site

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,030
and then colon and then put your domains

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,090
in I suppose you guys have website right

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:48,870
so you can you can put that in your

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:50,640
browser if you're using mobile you can

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,770
you can still do it but if you're using

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:58,680
desktop it will give you a number that

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:01,290
Google actually index how many page of

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,220
your website so you can get a general

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:07,230
idea that google index how many page of

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,070
your website which mean it's just a

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:14,400
chance that your page can actually rank

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:17,840
in the Google so and anyone try that you

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,840
guys have all right great

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:27,699
okay so the concept is Google first they

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,700
will Chrome for four links for contents

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,860
and then once they Chrome your page they

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,230
will consider whether they will index

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,750
your page in that database or not if

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,650
they have index and put into the

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,090
database you can use the previous syntax

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,150
to check how min the page has been

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,250
indexed only the page they have indexed

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,660
you can automate you cannot optimize

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:55,960
something that Google has an index yet

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:59,050
so there's a free top ranking signal for

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,750
for the SEO from the 200 of the ranking

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:04,120
signal so the first two you have seen it

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,580
which is the key works and then back

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,350
clean the third one is relate to

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,730
something called brain brain which is

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:16,000
user experience for example how long how

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,980
long people will stay in your website do

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,490
they only see one patient and they will

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,680
leave things like that and Google can

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,050
easily know how long people stay in your

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,360
website because you guys install Google

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,270
Analytics right you use Gmail right

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,880
you're locking right you use Chrome and

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,250
you use Google go to a link and then

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,990
click click back if you don't like it

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,190
right so all the information that

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:44,860
collects will you will determine that

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,800
your website UX is good or not in order

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,230
to bring your site up or down so a

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,740
simple idea would be if someone searched

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,420
for keywords say angers to say and if

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,150
your title is good enough

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,760
more people click on your link it gives

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,860
a strong signal that people actually

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,690
like this link better than that and then

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,640
from time to time they will move you out

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:13,660
so that this will be the idea of the UX

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,980
and the other thing is if you have

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,990
content in your website but your site

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,000
might or might not be ranking up in the

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,100
society in Google but do you know the

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,310
intention of searching the certain

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,780
keywords in order to reach to your site

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:33,900
there's a few types of search

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,510
intentional for the first one is like an

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,370
informational it's quite hard to convert

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,380
them to a customer for example people

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,660
just look for the best look for there

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,910
are four examples muffle this is type

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,710
different thing and then the commercial

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,530
intention will be like they type like

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,300
best off smartphone so they give give

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:56,550
more more like comparison kind of stuff

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,200
to the user but it is not exactly by the

00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,660
point they want to buy it they're more

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,270
like in the face of considerating and

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,730
the navigational is more like the

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,650
friending you know the most search in

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,200
google in the group is facebook.com

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,730
right people actually know the domain

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,340
but they'd go to Google and then they'd

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,860
search it for some reason so the

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,620
navigation is still very important and

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,230
then final which is the transactional

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,050
one is people who are searching like by

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,300
iPhone or they search for iPhone coupon

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,590
which they don't have but people still

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,410
search that when people search for

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,690
particular keywords that which drive

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,130
people to buy the products or surface

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,010
that will be a transaction though and

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,980
this is why those keywords are more

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,920
expensive and if you do have some

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,550
keywords relate to those expect it give

00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:54,390
you more more opportunity to rank in

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:58,260
Google search and just to give you a

00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:01,980
general idea that this is a reports for

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,200
marketing Chuckster showing the Google

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,900
actually dropping there with icing wires

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,640
Amazon this increasing more people

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,850
actually put advertising there the

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,710
reason is that if you go to Amazon what

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,510
you what will you do you go there to buy

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,030
stuff right you don't research that

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,970
right so you put advertising there it is

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,740
all about transactional so I put

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,410
advertising there people go to the

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,180
product they buy it so people the

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,010
merchant or the brand actually recognize

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,830
that so that's why they put more budget

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:34,620
there and Google action knows that and

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,140
they although they are still the market

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:40,990
leader but they they got worried and

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,390
that is why in the past year you can see

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,220
go change a lot of the things when you

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,280
search it for example the favorite icon

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,140
for example the feature snippet or they

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,460
put more different stuff in the Google

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:58,750
search in order to make the user stay on

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:02,020
the search one particular thing is

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,630
something called a MP our sera mobile

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,640
page in the past when you go to Google

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,220
you click on link right you go to a

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,290
sapper page open the new in array but

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,990
now when you click on that some of the

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,530
site it will be like pop-up pop-up

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,660
window you click close it will stay on

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,990
your Google search page the reason

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,240
behind is that because the traffic the

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,280
money's are dropping so they want to

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,500
keep you longer to yourself to their

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,490
search engine right so that is the idea

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,210
behind so I would like to let you guys

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:40,330
to do a really quick keyword research

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:43,600
which will help you to do for your

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:48,190
website so basically you could type in

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:52,300
some key works in Google now you can try

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:55,990
that so if you did that say I want to

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,570
find an English tutor if you do that it

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:03,100
will shows you something called Google

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:06,429
Suggest right it is simple but if you

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:11,080
move your cursor to this hop on to the

00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:15,010
front it will show you other other key

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,860
works as well so you can simply take

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,559
those such as the key works from Google

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,140
and try to see whether your content

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,450
actually fit for those and the reason

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,980
they put those key works in is that

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,610
Google knows those are the popular

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,559
keyword search or or phrase so it

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,140
already tells you what are people

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,990
searching in rankings so as long as you

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:41,290
put more similar keywords or phrases in

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,840
your content make user or make Google

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,610
easier to understand your content

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,450
actually match the user search

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,919
intentional gray

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,880
and it will house your website you

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,230
ranked on the top faster and this is

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,389
Google Suggest

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,080
and then I will move to the bottom and

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:00,769
then the other this one maybe may not

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,600
have one

00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:08,179
maybe I search other stuff let's say on

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,240
the bottom right here this is something

00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:14,630
called related related key works or what

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,539
we call LSI a legend semantic indexing

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:21,049
so it means that it does not necessarily

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:23,750
need to have to exact exact keywords of

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,690
what they search as long as it has the

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:30,230
same meaning it was shown it and if you

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,029
do that to your content you will be like

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,389
I'll rank somewhere for your competitor

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:38,090
already and the last thing I want you to

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:41,179
have a try in your mobile as well is you

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,100
go to your web search let's say you

00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,710
search a particular keywords and then

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:50,649
you see okay this is my competitor and

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:53,750
then I click on it and then I click back

00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:55,850
you will see something like this this is

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,299
actually new since few months again

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,309
right only happen in more it actually

00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,049
started in mobile desktop is recently

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,240
happening as well it will show you

00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:08,929
people go to that your competitor web

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,750
site we also show those keywords as well

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,909
people more interesting in those as well

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,470
but I'm not telling you to go to your

00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,679
competitor and then to click back

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:21,230
because they actually hurt their SEO you

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,480
guys because I go to your website for

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,399
one second and now go back the bank

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,880
their banks will increase and then the

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:32,059
time on site it's like lower right so I

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,880
don't tell you to attack your competitor

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:38,389
I'm just saying this is a way to do

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,110
competitor research right don't be evil

00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:42,940
yeah

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,249
right that's just a screen no moisture

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,840
so the other thing I would like to talk

00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:49,509
about would be the content strategy for

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,570
the SEO and I'll need to do that quick

00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:55,869
and they have five minutes left so this

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,450
is a question I got us a lot of a time

00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,330
do you have a lot of content with is it

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:04,389
is the better for SEO if I have more

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:07,929
frequent sup day more article in the

00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:08,590
website as it is a better than in SEO do

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:11,019
you guys think

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,659
yes do you think yeah more content more

00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:16,450
frequent for for SEO yeah

00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:19,509
and anyway yeah fresh corner anyone say

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:25,029
no no one right there's a couple of that

00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:29,080
there you want just talk about that so I

00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:31,749
want to give you an idea I have a

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,220
website but this is in in traditional

00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:35,649
Chinese but just to give you a brief

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,909
idea let's say assertion WordPress Hong

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:43,720
Kong and there's one of my site I put it

00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:47,489
as a testing right and let me go to that

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,999
home page for this particular website I

00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:55,570
only have free article that's it and all

00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:59,559
article actually publish since 10 months

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,659
ago so it is all and it is definitely

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,909
not the fresh content s is only free the

00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:07,539
piece of content ray so that is bad for

00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:10,929
se RA all right let me give you the

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:14,710
Google Analytics of my site right

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:18,159
since I published the first content only

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:21,519
free content action eight months ago

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,769
yeah and I did nothing that's it and

00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,159
then it's just keep rising I'm searching

00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:28,600
for the drink dis few months for on the

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,629
top you can see it's only for the

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,480
organic search so the traffic is for SEO

00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:36,909
Ernie from Google traffic's and I did

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,919
nothing else sick eight months ago

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,659
content only free piece of content and

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,659
it kept rising why

00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:52,350
because what you actually need is not

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,779
just fresh content you do not need to

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,110
have a lot of content in order to reign

00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:00,240
at the top in Google it doesn't work

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,059
like that Google does a really simple

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,159
job you go to google you search for

00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,799
something they give you the best result

00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,830
of what you search that is what they

00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,200
want to do they don't say I give you the

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,450
result which the publisher gives you the

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,429
most content or most update content of

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,769
course if you're saying I would like to

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,480
buy an iPhone I give you the latest one

00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,179
rate I will show you the result of

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,119
iPhone one or something leather but it

00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,919
just didn't work like that way you do

00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,039
not need to have a lot of content in

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,249
order to rank really high so let me show

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:39,720
you what my content is so for example

00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:43,740
this is one of my content let me show

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,499
you how many words I got I got about

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:51,019
5,000 traditional Chinese were here

00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:54,659
which is equivalent to roughly 10,000

00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:57,450
words in English nothing like that

00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:01,820
the point I'm trying to make is I do not

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:05,789
know how to write Chinese I actually use

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:09,480
voice to tax in order to make this and I

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:12,960
do not do that by one goal I do that

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,269
article eight times I put like 400 words

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,039
and then put it up and then for the next

00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:20,100
few days I put they another 400 works

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,110
because I cannot produce like a five

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,369
thousand word in one go and the other

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,559
thing is you could always find a way to

00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:31,529
find someone else to type for you or or

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,259
do things like that and I have something

00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:38,840
called index page you can see like a

00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:42,299
book array and the index page alone is

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,889
461 word but the index page is good

00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:49,529
because if a user seeing us such a long

00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:52,320
post they actually scary but they can

00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:54,340
always click on only the part they like

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,540
to see

00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:02,410
because of that they can actually search

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:04,960
a particular keywords in Google and it

00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,380
will show something called cycling which

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,660
I showed previously it gives you an

00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,840
extra benefit in order to show to the

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:17,100
user when they search a particular key

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,560
work so what you need to do is not

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,140
frequents content is not really a fresh

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,190
content what you need to do is something

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,430
that people want to see so that's a

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,160
whole idea and this is the expect for

00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,990
the UX as well and if you do not like to

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,650
write that's fine I actually put a post

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,920
like this

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,420
I asked 20 people who are experienced in

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,970
WordPress I just have some really simple

00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,100
questions say what do you think what

00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,230
theme do you actually use in what pluck

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,000
in do you use and then I just wait for

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,540
the answer that's it and then I got

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,660
6,000 Wesley on the next few days that's

00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,480
it and it is really easy way to do it

00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,720
and also this strategy is good for

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,340
something that if you ask someone for

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,310
the opinion and they put their website

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:09,220
in if you are being interviewed normally

00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,890
they will share this particular link in

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:15,400
their website right and and in facebook

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,680
as well so it has to be backlink in a

00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,030
sense because I'm actually running out

00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:25,180
of time I have to go to the last slide

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:27,460
which is my content but my content is in

00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,740
the traditional Chinese you can email me

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:33,370
I got a fan page as well I got a few

00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:35,590
hundred people there and I use a lot of

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,950
different views in order to increase a

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,920
rich to avoid too much competition in

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,040
just using Facebook or IG I use a lot of

00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,370
different views that's all for my speech

00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:53,799
today thank you very much

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:56,509
[Applause]

00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:09,350
I thought everyone came up with

00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:12,759
impressions while I meant the content is

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,759
not important to be

00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:22,060
wars are the the freshness of the

00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:25,060
content the number of the content is not

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,010
bit as let's say I only have free piece

00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,860
of content in my website but they are

00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,960
long enough that in bath enough so

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,300
people actually recognize the free piece

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,770
of content and rent a lot of different

00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,200
keywords relate to the content because

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,240
of a content they are long enough I can

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,610
I can put a lot of different key works

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,710
inside the content so the content they

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,900
are important but they have to be expert

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,830
enough and long enough for Google to

00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,300
understand that when people see the

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,400
article like five thousand work it give

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,550
them the example it gives an impression

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,770
like wow that must be good right maybe

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,480
you haven't seen it but you can send to

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,510
your friend so that is one of the way

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,720
the long content will help in the sense

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,720
here

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:24,250
it should be here

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:26,380
into space like my home page it actually

00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,790
doesn't doesn't really matter because

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,880
you cannot put all the content of the

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:33,280
home page right it would be one page

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,970
right and you only got one chance for

00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,300
the Google search a home page is is more

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:44,110
like on my blog homepage just like

00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,850
indexing for the three different blog

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,340
posts a more like a diverse a fight but

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,540
for the for the SEO aspect it doesn't it

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,970
doesn't need to be that's always just

00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,970
submit the link to Google did we know

00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,530
yeah thought was the best are used if

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,480
there's one feature which dimension in

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:15,760
there which is the suit on this we've

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:21,419
got one store yeah yeah sir you mean

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:24,330
search console yeah basically since 2011

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:27,610
Google analytic actually shut down the

00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,980
key works which you wait with you see in

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,210
the past what key works people search

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,480
and then the Google Website

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,270
but since 2011 it doesn't work that way

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,550
because they were pace that we want to

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,669
keep people privacy so we shut that up

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,960
so you need to use something called

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,850
webmaster tools in the past but they

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,460
renamed to your search console last year

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:52,450
so it gives you an idea exactly what

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,450
people search and your york us position

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,430
for people to search to show what

00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:01,000
keywords actually are doing better and

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,170
you can compare month by month or

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,390
certain key works are they are they

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:06,190
growing or are they dropping or is there

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,210
any new opportunity of the key works

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,130
they may be rising

00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,860
so that's on it you need that if you

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,990
want to understand what people search in

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:17,140
or do you find your website yeah but you

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,750
do not need to do that inside the Yoast

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:23,070
SEO plug-in you just go to Google search

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,070
console and buy what you find

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:32,850
what happened it works it will show some

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:35,280
figures in the yolks as I remember

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,869
because I didn't use it because if they

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,540
want to make it better they need to keep

00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:41,730
updating the API which I don't think

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,260
there will be that frequence yeah the

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,940
other thing in the search console is

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,700
that if you want Google to find your

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,810
site faster you need to submit an XML

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:57,140
sitemap yeah doctor we have a lot yeah

00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:57,140
yeah time for one question away

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,430
I'm in Christ and I would like to hear

00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:06,040
your opinion regarding the u.s. so as we

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,089
said the amount of traffic also affects

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,339
your rankings

00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:11,140
yeah but nowadays people rarely go to

00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:13,000
the second page right so that this means

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,790
that specific pages which are already on

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,940
the first Google pages correct get the

00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:21,130
most traffic how do you think it would

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,079
be possible for the new content to be

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,750
correct right here

00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,329
good question Kate so so basically what

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,430
I also would do I would go to Google

00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:32,560
Analytics and then I would go to you

00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:35,319
like in the past month the top traffic

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,079
pages top traffic patience means Google

00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,270
already find a page right and you've got

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,630
traffic's in that page what you could do

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:46,450
you put internal link from that traffic

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:51,400
pages the idea of Google find your site

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:53,260
is simple they go to a very frequent we

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,880
set in page like the top of a page and

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,910
then they will look at it every single

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,130
day to see any update of it if you put

00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:03,040
something there it will help Google to

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,770
Chrome from this page to the new page

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,069
which means Google discovered a new page

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:11,140
faster so it does help a lot if you put

00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:13,180
internal link but you don't put internal

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,859
link in a way lazy way which mean you

00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,720
just spun your link there it doesn't

00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,849
work correct you need to put something

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,270
what we call text anchor you

00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,390
specifically link a key works internally

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,060
to the second page to tell Google this

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,579
specific key works belongs to the new

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,250
page as well so it will house Google

00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,260
finally falsi and then how Google to

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,010
rank the right keywords to the new page

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,010
yeah

00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,940
thank you I know you probably have a lot

00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,240
more questions but please look for

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:50,010
either nobility I've nowhere to go I'm

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,010
