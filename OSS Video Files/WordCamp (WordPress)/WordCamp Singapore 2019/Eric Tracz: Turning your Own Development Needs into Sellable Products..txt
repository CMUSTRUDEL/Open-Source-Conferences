Title: Eric Tracz: Turning your Own Development Needs into Sellable Products.
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	Running a business with a WordPress site is relatively easy. Tens of thousands of plugins out there do help a lot, but sometimes itâ€™s hard to find a perfectly tailored solution. Often, you do end up developing custom code for your site. Consider putting a bit extra effort and convert that custom solution into a sellable product. That can not only cover the cost of initial development and maintenance but also present another revenue stream.

thank you very much thank you for having

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,690
me

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,429
so I really like the talk that Stephanie

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,349
gave talking about Tunisia because this

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,929
is something that that we do we have our

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,580
own niche and let me just start by

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,070
talking a little bit of my myself so you

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,170
can actually know who I am what I do so

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,789
you can just call me Eric my polish name

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,160
is our kaduche don't even attempt that

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,160
that's why I've been Eric for the past

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,550
decade or so surname is the same so just

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,949
Eric waiting up so don't follow whatever

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,680
I say it just blindly or anyone else for

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,630
that matter do your own research be very

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,070
critical and thinking whatever it's

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,719
being presented just because someone is

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,629
on stage like me doesn't mean I know

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:49,469
 sometimes I don't which is gonna be

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:51,629
probably proven later so we are a small

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,670
team of around 10 people and we come

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,469
from all of these countries on and/or

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,899
work with people from these countries

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,600
this is a picture from word camp

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,820
Jakarta this year and was great so we

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,989
were able to actually bring some of our

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,260
team and those are the foreign

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,420
Indonesian guys who work with us we we

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,070
were able to bring them to the word camp

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,560
to actually sponsor it and we're very

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,330
happy that was I believe our first the

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,420
first word comes we actually were able

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:24,470
to sponsor because for the first couple

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,470
of years of our nish it was hard man

00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:36,079
like that hard sometimes it was a

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,200
printed photo because we didn't have

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,890
phones not that buddy but yeah it was

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,659
bad so um our product peeps so you can

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,970
can google that it's a social networking

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,289
plugin for WordPress and we do that but

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,399
I'm not gonna go into details I just

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,740
want to talk about the business in

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,350
general so this actually started as a

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,979
side project we came from Joomla world

00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,170
and peeps we were kind of forced to go

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,869
into WordPress so one time at the point

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,580
at one time my boss came to me on Monday

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,289
it's like um hi Eric so you know working

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,819
with Joomla for like five years now so

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:10,090
today your start on WordPress

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:13,250
I don't know WordPress figure it out

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,720
that was it so there was a there still

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,519
is an extension for Joomla called Jim

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,140
social some of you may know it or may

00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,480
have heard about it so people so pretty

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,830
much does the same thing but it's for

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,450
WordPress it's a bigger market share

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,780
it's a bigger community it's a better

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,160
community if I dare say so myself and

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,760
but the first couple of years were

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,920
really hard to break into that WordPress

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,320
means to do to be able to find clients

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,209
to be able to market it properly the big

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,970
competitors like buddypress um I think

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,810
ultimate member although they're not

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,239
hundred percent covered in the same

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,090
features we did have very hard time

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,019
breaking breaking into the market and

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,180
the previous owner of the company

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,600
treated people so kind of like a side

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,150
project again and finally she decided to

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,500
kind of drop everything retire so me and

00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,450
Matt we actually took over the company

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,819
we took over the project and when we

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,850
took it over this was our state we were

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,600
losing money but we cut down costs we

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,880
actually were forced to to have people

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,069
work part-time for us for like a better

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,680
part of a year just to kind of break

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,540
even and everything but it actually did

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,970
work out pretty well so I'm here I can

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,380
talk to you guys and right now we're

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,410
thinking about the versafine and

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,590
actually trying to do so so just talking

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,150
about general business building so what

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,709
do you need you in the website I'm not

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,120
gonna go into the details because you

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,010
all kind of have your own businesses

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,510
websites and everything like that but

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,700
you know you're using third-party

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,540
software sometimes you're using your own

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,269
software but whenever you're using

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,700
third-party software very rarely it's

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,189
100% matching features sometimes you

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,280
want to sell plugins online or so your

00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:53,140
software online but the features are

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
just not there not the ones that you

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,930
need specifically for your business so

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:02,049
what you end up with is well you have a

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,090
problem this is what happens you have a

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,519
problem but problems are great because

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,010
you can solve them if you have a problem

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,470
you know that you can solve it like for

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,599
example we are using a DD on our website

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,519
so our software and our one of our

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,510
biggest problems was that we were

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,400
selling licenses and people can do

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,400
updates on those licenses but this is

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,889
what EDD offers for you so you have one

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,110
button like a link hidden somewhere in

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,729
the account and it's just there and

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,900
people don't see it they have no idea

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,630
that they can actually upgrade their

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,340
license after made the purchase right so

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,970
they don't know how should they know so

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:45,490
a problem was you know do that so

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,970
possible solutions I kind of had fun

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,970
with this

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,980
so let's start with the first one so we

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,850
can have in-house crap

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,500
so coded rapidly and poorly that kind of

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,720
development I think everyone has been

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,270
there at some point in their like

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,400
business development just get it done

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,260
get it passed stitched together so it

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,940
works so it's good to develop it's

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,580
relatively cheap because all you need to

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,260
do is kind of like donate your time to

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,570
make it work but it's very hard to

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,420
maintain it's impossible to package to

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,240
sell to anyone it'll get you there but

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,610
you know you may not really survive you

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,350
will sleep every night and if you hack

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,580
the code directory of any plug-in team

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,990
or whatever you know you cannot do

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,510
updates because it will override

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,790
whatever you did so you're kind of stuck

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,080
with it and you have to reapply the hack

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,420
after every upgrade and then you're like

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,860
run down so you keep ending up doing the

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,740
same crap all over over again the other

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,540
thing is so you can have the third-party

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,750
development probably already rebranding

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,270
that you so you can have a budget from

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,800
ranging from $1 to $1,000,000 per hour

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,980
there's really like no limit for

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,930
third-party developers and you can pay

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,120
you have to pay to maintain it because

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,110
if I come to a third-party developer

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,030
okay so I have this problem can you fix

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,680
it for me he's good yeah sure here's the

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,870
code yeah okay so let's do that and

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,060
after a month I need to do some updates

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,130
or whatever but you have to pay again

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,260
and you have to pay again and you have

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,150
no control or very little control over

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,250
the quality of the code over the

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,710
extensibility of the code you have like

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,940
pretty much nothing and whatever you

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,890
want to do you have to end up you know

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,930
paying for it sometimes more than it's

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,030
actually worth it and just you know say

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,950
it's very risky because there was a mark

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,090
guy who also was a third-party developer

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,490
at some point so you know you might end

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,040
up kind of having a great idea for your

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,230
solution hire a developer and it doesn't

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,760
matter if the guys from the US some

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,050
people say that Indian developers are

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,430
not great some people say people from

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,950
Bhangra and other best some people say

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,660
polo and whatever it doesn't matter

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,050
surprise developer you will always have

00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:00,490
these kind of risks so then you can do

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,160
the good in-house development which is

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,100
gloriously outstanding

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,530
opportunity to do it will not be fast it

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,490
just just won't it's going you have to

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:14,730
treat it as I would say regular product

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,370
development because it's gonna be more

00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,320
expensive you will need more than kind

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,050
of one guy stitching everything together

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,090
to make it work it's gonna but it's

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,660
gonna be worth it because when you have

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,630
a very nicely written piece of code you

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,730
can package it easily you don't have to

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,100
be worried that it's gonna explode you

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,180
have to worry about supporting it that

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,210
much you don't have to worry about

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,950
third-party incompatibilities or

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,590
something else breaking your stuff or

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,700
your stuff breaking something else and

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,370
when you apply it on your one own

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,190
website you can actually sleep better

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,110
because you know that no automatic

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,180
update is gonna break yourself and then

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,710
in the middle of the night your whole

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,000
business kind of crashes for a couple of

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,770
hours and some of us cannot really

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,200
afford that so it's but this kind of

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,970
development is suitable only for when

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,860
your company can actually afford it I

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,660
can tell you that from experience when

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,990
you're comfortable with it because when

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,760
you're kind of starting and you have the

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,770
bowl of rice with a picture of a chicken

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,850
next to it then you kind of just want to

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,710
make it work

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,460
you're not really worried about the

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,990
third party or extra development needs

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,930
that you know to package someone you're

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,580
just trying to focus on the niche that

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:34,169
Stefanie described so well to actually

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:37,260
make some money and the other way to go

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,110
is to go open-source so sometimes other

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,450
users really can excite so it's either

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,680
cheap or free you can open up your

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,270
software if you have an idea for

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,520
something put it on github put it on

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:52,650
github and you can build a community

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,650
behind it and have people have fun with

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,180
the idea the code contribute it's not

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,190
gonna cost you pretty much anything

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,230
except for your time again and if you

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,630
open it you know sharing is caring

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,150
but you're a risk off of this approach

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,860
is kind of abandonware because we've all

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,330
seen plugins which were doing very well

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,070
at some point but there were free

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,900
everyone's using them eighty thousand

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,820
fifty thousand hundred thousand installs

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,550
but then they were not updated for two

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,860
years

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,720
it's a liability so you need to also

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,500
keep that kind of approach in mind and

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,820
that's why we believe like as a company

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,220
and everything you should be actually

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,310
paid for your work because when you are

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,190
paid for your work you do that work when

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,420
you treat it as a side project you have

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,700
a baby change something in your life

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,980
you're just gonna leave it that's why it

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,720
becomes abandonware

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:47,170
so so we would rather have rather have

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,620
open source but paid software rather

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,230
than you know just just getting there so

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,750
our solution in the beginning was pretty

00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:02,080
much a mixed bag of crap that turned out

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:05,350
good but the problems that we've we've

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,410
had with the licenses was so we had the

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,510
licenses being bought by clients and as

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,100
I said we we had very big problems in

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,200
the beginning to actually be profitable

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,200
and to actually be able to offer that

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,579
chicken from the picture and so we

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,510
applied the stitching and everything on

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:27,310
our website so we made we made the

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,079
custom software we actually hacked EDD

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,660
and everything to make it look good to

00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,160
actually push people into upgrading

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,510
their licenses they're already clients

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,990
they're already spending money they

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,190
already know you're doing a good job you

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,930
know they're you have money so they

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,480
might as well pay you more why not but

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:51,160
you really do need that proof of concept

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,839
so this is this is what we created so

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,880
right now if you remember it as a little

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,570
link that you had in EDD right now we

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,910
can do this so you have a pop-up and so

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,380
in that plugin I'm not gonna share the

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,440
details of it if you want you're into it

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,000
after the presentation just so we have a

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,690
pop-up so when you visit a website let's

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,910
say you purchased a license on Monday we

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,410
can configure it so that when you see

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,899
when you enter the website like after a

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,180
week you can see the pop-up showing once

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,279
twice three times you can decide to show

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,110
it after a week after eight days 180

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,089
days wherever a number of days the

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,209
pop-up is gonna show and of course since

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,180
its wordpress ends very well coded you

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,700
can

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,500
style it however you want as well it's

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,620
very easy templating we do have the

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,779
widgets the blocks this is a widget so

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,640
you can have you know did you know you

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:45,019
can custom you can customize the message

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,579
you can customize the look and feel of

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,980
it you can tablet however you want and

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:50,269
it's one click table with the license so

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,519
you click on the upgrade takes you to

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,290
the cart applies everything and you just

00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:00,019
checkout process and you already have

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:02,959
that on your websites we also added the

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,510
blocks and the shortcode so that you can

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
put those messages into your regular

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,250
blog posts so you have a blog post

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,829
announcing you know there's a new update

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,959
to keep so coming out but did you know

00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,300
that you can upgrade your license you

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,430
send we send out emails to people hey

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,660
there's a new version they know is very

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,279
simple there's a new version you should

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,320
see the change lock your subway today

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,310
they go to the website they with the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,019
change lock and all the announcements

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,850
and then they get this but you can

00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,279
upgrade your license it's kind of inline

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,730
all in their face but it's very subtle

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,600
in the sense of it flows very well and

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,390
clients do upgrade way more way more

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,029
than they used to because they didn't in

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,279
the past to be honest but with this

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:49,990
approach we can actually we can actually

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:56,660
make money from from that from that

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:58,579
product so why and when to do it you

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,860
really don't have much to lose because

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,899
you really don't if you have a proof

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,110
proof of concept like I said if you have

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,839
a your own need like it's started for us

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,940
with that little link but we hacked and

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,620
stitched everything together we saw that

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,329
the leads are coming to us people are

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,240
upgrading their licenses people are

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,649
coming to us and not saying in support

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,360
like how can I help with the license or

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,949
something they just they just do it it's

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,250
in their face they don't have a problem

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:27,589
with it and that works for us we thought

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,100
okay we don't want to spend more time

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,620
and money and work hours on a board like

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,430
keeping EDD hacked enough so that kind

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,160
of works for us

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,170
so we decided to do it well the good

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,389
approach so you can package it and you

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,339
can if there's a problem

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:48,799
just install it update the plugin is

00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:50,809
good plus it's very easy to maintain and

00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,999
if you already have a client base like

00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,889
we do with people so we have our clients

00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:58,129
who are willing to pay money most of

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,389
them are also businesses so they have

00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,069
their own communities there using our

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,480
software they're using EDD some of them

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:05,179
are using walk numbers but those who are

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
using EDD we can target them they

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,929
already know us so it's like hey would

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,850
you like to grow your business more it's

00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,009
just like licensing related this is a

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,959
very very niche market don't get me

00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:18,199
wrong it's very niche but people will

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,910
buy it and they do so this for us which

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,920
started people itself started as a side

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,389
project that grew and then from that

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,029
side project we have another one and

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,619
this is being marketed not on the pizza

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,739
website it's totally separate project

00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:33,350
speaking and kind of relating to

00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:36,350
Stephanie's presentation so do a

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,360
different website make it brand it

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,610
differently you can say that this

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,319
website is a part of pizza or pizza

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,149
corporation whatever however you want to

00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:46,369
phrase that so that people know that

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,839
okay it sounds like randomly so it's

00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:50,360
linked to your project but it's linked

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,649
to your project is not the main target

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,509
so you don't want to end up as the the

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,989
website that she actually showed in the

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:58,069
beginning right in her presentation and

00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:59,509
of course you need to have a proof of

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:02,389
concept because if you don't if you just

00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:05,089
have an idea it's in my opinion it's a

00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:07,249
bad choice to step out of that niche and

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,350
kind of diversify too much because if

00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:11,089
you lose your focus you're going to end

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,489
up doing the 50 different things at the

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,339
same time and you're not going to go

00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:19,160
anywhere with it so you need to be very

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:23,290
comfortable with the idea that you have

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,689
and these are some of the very famous

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,929
side projects like Twitter it was a side

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:33,199
project for the guys they just needed a

00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,579
mean to express themselves and it ended

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,989
up being one of the biggest social

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,639
networking pod from some of the plant

00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:39,769
everyone's heard of it I'm pretty sure

00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,790
like 99% of you guys have a Twitter

00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:45,799
account you have optimal this guy is he

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,379
was working for mint.com he saw the need

00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:51,019
for it and he just created it and was a

00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,870
side project of his same with github

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:58,410
these are all the side projects

00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,210
buffer slacked which all side projects

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,120
and these are one of the biggest

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:05,130
companies right now in the IT industry

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,490
they just start from people who have a

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,070
problem and people want to fill in a

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,490
small niche but they don't really want

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,960
to you know break their focus and the

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,150
final thought for us that this is

00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:25,340
something that we really want to stick

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:25,340
with when it comes to our company yeah

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,390
but you know if you if you do it like

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:35,820
that you kind of sleep well don't you

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:40,050
and consider this an ite and the IT

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,500
industry you have a big turnover in some

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,790
of the companies developers come and go

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,040
designers come and go it's easier for

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,540
them when the code is documented when

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,100
the code is tested when the code is

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,110
actually written well with some

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,510
standards that's why we to pay attention

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,370
to standards and not has for lack of a

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,970
better term such an OCD when it comes to

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,380
code that yeah it's actually drives me

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,880
nuts sometimes but he does keep

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,610
everything in check and it's very easy

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,440
for a new people because we did start

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,760
hiring new people it's very easy for

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,860
them to just like kind of jump on board

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,720
see what's going on okay everything is

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,760
well documented just move on a world

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,400
they don't have to spend months of

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,829
research trying to kind of break

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,690
everything down and reverse engineer

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,140
what's going on was this function doing

00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,120
so doing it like that kind of kind of

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,770
works for us and I suggest that you all

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,780
kind of consider doing the same or a

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:36,030
similar approach I'd say thank you and

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,750
now if you guys have any questions I

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,750
welcome them

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,770
any questions

00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:30,239
yeah hypo

00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:34,139
how do you we don't really do custom

00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:36,659
work because we believe that that we

00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:39,659
would rather focus on a product that we

00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:42,059
have and if we did so do some custom

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:43,679
work but it's always in line of clients

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,479
need a feature and they're willing to

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,669
pay for it a feature that we could add

00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:49,379
to the codebase and kind of like you

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,149
know it goes to the mainstream product

00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,619
that's what we can do if they want to

00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:54,210
speed up a development of a certain

00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,379
feature then yeah that's that's

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,369
something that we would do and

00:18:55,379 --> 00:19:02,099
prioritize for money but the whole

00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:04,859
client buys ended up ends up profiting

00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:09,749
from it and the same the same way just

00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:11,849
to can add on top we did like like with

00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:14,700
pizza we did like a lot of plugins for

00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,840
it but we started we feel like we want

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,460
to give back to the community because

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,979
like a free plugin you can buy add-ons

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,909
on top of it but after some time like we

00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:25,799
already managed to kind of take the paid

00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:28,109
plugins and put them into the free pizza

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,359
base so that people more people in the

00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:32,519
free every product can benefit from it

00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,529
more so that after some time we kind of

00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,879
like decide okay this is a great feature

00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,440
to just add to the free product give

00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:41,369
back to the community to people to just

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,440
have yeah but custom code we don't

00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:46,649
really do in that sense of like random

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,849
projects it's not sustainable in our way

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,849
and it's not what we do

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:03,440
we okay so if there's a conflict with

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:05,240
our plugin right yeah so you come to us

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,999
you have a website there's a conflict if

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,100
it we investigated 100% if it's a

00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,600
problem of our plugin we fix it if it's

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,399
a problem problem the third party

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,259
plug-in our solution then we told you

00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,570
like you know you gotta go to those guys

00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:21,580
because we cannot really fix third party

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,580
stuff that's not really what we do a

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:45,220
product or some other site produce this

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:54,919
it's so people so is our flagship kind

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,950
of main product and way to profit and

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,690
just recently like in the few to three

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,570
months but we're not pushing it too much

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,100
we created a site project and a site

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,970
different web site different everything

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,730
with different accounts everything it's

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,580
totally separate but it's kind of like

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,990
made by by our in-house guys right but

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,970
it's marketed completely completely

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,009
separately we don't put everything on

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,369
one website it's just it doesn't work

00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,860
like that

00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:25,159
of course when like email goes to the

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,409
clients hey but you know we also have

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,799
this project so it's kind of marketed in

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:32,980
that way but it's not being like all put

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,980
together

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm acting over it right now to be

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,210
honest we don't do too much marketing

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,430
for the site project because we think

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,440
that it's a great solution but it's to

00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,870
Nishi and we don't feel comfortable

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,370
enough yet to kind of step out from the

00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:01,700
very comfortable people so people so

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,320
let's call it bed but we are getting to

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,210
the point like I mentioned we're hiring

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,640
more people when we get to the point we

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,890
can actually spare like one to three

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,380
people to actually work exclusively on

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,420
that and the decide project then yeah

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,860
then we'll we'll do more marketing and

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:24,080
everything else but it needs to mature

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:26,750
more for us no it's going to each

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,250
separate so it's separate yeah it would

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,680
be completely separate because there's

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,270
you cannot really put those are two

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,200
different products even though the

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,960
platform is the same

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,960
I wouldn't put them you know together

00:22:41,950 --> 00:23:15,470
if you have questions so so Matt since

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,370
we're co-owners fifty-fifty he was

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:23,120
working full-time you know 16 hours a

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:26,180
day kind of thing and we had four

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,640
developers in Indonesia so we kind of

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,680
took over everything with the team so we

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,730
had four developers in Indonesia one

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,180
developer in Poland at the time one

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,680
admin in Argentina but we had to cut

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,110
them to like part-time they were all

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,420
working for hours a day so so it was

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,950
like the bare minimum so that they

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,290
didn't have to look for a job because we

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,050
know that it was growing whatever wasn't

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,940
growing fast enough to support that but

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,520
once we got to the point like everyone

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,950
got raises full-time and whatnot so but

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,810
it needed to be

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,100
yeah we didn't have any extra funding or

00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,100
nothing we're actually bleeding money

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:11,060
everyone was back full-time or after a

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,320
year I would say yeah and but just to

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,170
just to kind of finish up when we were

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,270
taking over the company there was a

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,640
problem of EBV on the website and that

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,460
was probably the result of some some

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,340
hacking a very dirty one and some of the

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,830
reporting because of the previous owner

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,630
had a few different businesses online so

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,360
the reporting for indie for pizza was

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,280
showing numbers but those numbers were

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,840
fake there was like one third too much

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,420
of what actually ended up in the bank

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,770
account so we took over the company you

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,450
think you know it's profitable we're

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,080
actually at breakeven and now not so

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,600
much

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:59,790
and then the rice and chicken pictures

00:24:45,600 --> 00:25:03,740
you know questions okay right you know

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:11,280
we finished up a little bit so we've got

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:13,170
obviously for their next talk it's gonna

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,530
be on SEO for business and in the next

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,590
room is going to be a talk on don't be

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,590
nervous

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,030
