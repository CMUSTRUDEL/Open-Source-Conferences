Title: Lawrence Hughes: How and Why to Publish Your Site on IPv6
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	IPv6 is the next-generation Internet Protocol. Already some 27% of global traffic is going over it, and many countries are already over 50%. Many mobile service providers are already over 90% IPv6. It is important for you to provide your content over both IPv4 and IPv6 and with WordPress it is actually quite simple. I will show you how to do this.

hello well it's great to have a chance

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,070
to speak to you guys and I'm actually

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,310
based here in Singapore so I don't have

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:19,160
any jetlag to blame anything on but

00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,359
hopefully you'll find this interesting

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,330
this is a little different from the

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,119
other talks here it's kind of deep in

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,310
the networking stat but it impacts what

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,940
you do with web hosting dramatically and

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,649
in fact a lot of people say ipv6 you

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,430
know this isn't this is a really obscure

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,309
topic and a very dry in reality we're at

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,399
the verge of a third generation of the

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,770
global Internet the first generation was

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,410
ARPANET which had 8-bit addresses and

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:55,219
maybe 10,000 people total ever used it

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:59,129
and it lasted from 1969 50 years ago to

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,170
1983 and so it started the first four

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,719
nodes of ARPANET were connected together

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,500
about the time Armstrong was taking a

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,119
stroll on the moon and so this is a lot

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,860
of people don't realize how far back the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,750
internet really goes but that was the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,259
first generation and they actually had

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,799
things like email and file transfer and

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,130
so on but of course they didn't have web

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,040
but basically with 8 bits you can only

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,570
have 256 nodes now at the time a node

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,909
was like a mainframe computer with

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,270
hundreds of users so it's a little

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,180
different from today but 8 bits was you

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,829
know they ran out of that pretty quickly

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,360
so the second generation Internet is

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,500
what most before using today

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,189
that's ipv4 and it was actually first

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,100
first went live January 1 1983 and it's

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,950
still widely used but starting around

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,649
the mid-90s we basically broke it

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,090
horribly because we were running out of

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,340
public addresses where they were all

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,549
gonna be gone by 2000 at the rate we

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,920
were putting them out and so the IETF

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,500
came up with a couple of workarounds one

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,229
was network address translation another

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,140
is called private addresses and actually

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,540
if you read the RFC its addresses for

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,580
that Internet's and so we actually

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,080
fractured the global internet into

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,780
millions of little private Internet's

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,000
each one of which is hiding behind one

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,340
real public address that basically ipv6

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,800
was actually originally specified in

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,990
1995 that it's really only going live in

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,760
the last few years because people

00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,700
realize that ipv4 is really an

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,250
end-of-life it's it's dying and so we've

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,020
got to replace it the good news is this

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,300
make some enormous changes in the way

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,459
things work there's now an essentially

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,320
unlimited number of global addresses you

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,120
don't really have to go to a web hosting

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,790
facility anymore to get a public address

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,620
you could have a thousand public

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,390
addresses in your own house with no

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,940
problem each one I'm with a little

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,860
Raspberry Pi running a web site you

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,350
could have a web site running on your

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,640
phone if you really wanted to I'm not

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,040
sure why and you might want to do that

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,989
but you know you could port Apache to

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,660
Android and having a web site running on

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,100
your phone I'm planning to make a FTP

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,350
server that runs on my phone here

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,910
shortly I'm also working on software

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,420
that goes directly from my phone to

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,500
yours with no intermediary server this

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,660
revolutionizes the way things work and

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,959
so I'm gonna give you a little talk

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,030
about this and how it impacts hosting

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,799
and so on okay as they mentioned I've

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,160
been around about forty five years in

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,670
the field and I'm working working on my

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,510
fifth venture now six scape my third one

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,330
was actually in the US in 2000 2006 we

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,780
went from 6 people in my basement to 250

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,739
people and sold for 273 million and so

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm a serial entrepreneur I wrote a book

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,459
on ipv6 back in 2010 and posted it on

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,930
the global ipv6 Forum website it's been

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,330
downloaded about a half a million times

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,730
so far so I'm somewhat of an authority

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,709
in this field ok I've got two websites

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,720
that if you're interested in digging

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,579
deeper into what's going on are out

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,160
there and when I'm is called

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,010
third internet comm and when I'm is

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,750
called v6 edu com

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,070
the second one is really for people are

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,140
very serious about this network

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,550
engineers and so on I've got people

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,740
hitting these sites from all over the

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,229
world and of course they run on

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,430
WordPress up

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:34,320
so now in the tcp/ip Network stack

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,789
there's actually four layers I'm not

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,039
going to go into too much detail on this

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,720
and there's no quiz at the end the top

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,009
layers application layer that's where

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,520
most of the protocols you're familiar

00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:47,250
with live like HTTP FTP SMTP and so on

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,250
next layer down is transport where TCP

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,970
and UDP live and finally we get down to

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,620
the layer where IP Liz and so this is

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,570
pretty obscure something buried that

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,660
deep in the Internet but it makes an

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,100
enormous impact the bottom layer is the

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,350
link layer which is where things like

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,419
Ethernet and Wi-Fi live we're not going

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,520
to worry too much about that

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:12,150
okay so basically IP lives in that next

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,470
to bottom layer and it uses IP addresses

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,080
the old-style

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,820
ipv4 looks like one two three dot four

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,340
or five dot six seven eight nine you've

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,490
seen those most your life the new ones

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,259
look a little strange first off it's

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,539
128-bit addresses which means there's

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,639
340 trillion trillion trillion possible

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,690
global addresses we ain't gonna run out

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,370
this time but basically we or we

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,419
organize a little bit instead of four

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,840
groups of decimal digits from 0 to 255

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:46,800
it's now eight groups of hex digits four

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,500
digits each group and so we have letters

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,180
in our numbers now which confuses some

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,580
people that it's just it's just base 16

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,740
so don't get worried if your addresses

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,460
now start having letters A through F in

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,340
them that's just basic steam but anyway

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,080
most software never uses IP directly but

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,110
only indirectly through the socket API

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,560
which is what Apache uses and so on and

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,930
the transport layer is like TCP or UDP

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,280
but IP determines the number of bits in

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,130
the IP addresses which in turn

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,949
determines the number of addresses ipv4

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,690
had a total of 4.3 billion we've got 20

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,539
billion people using the Internet today

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,310
huh how did that happen well they had to

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,610
go through no address translation and

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,510
create private Internet's that basically

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,430
are very much like having a PBX in an

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,750
office phone system you don't have a

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,120
real phone number you've got an

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,260
extension and so mostly addresses you're

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,590
working with nary extent

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,520
so when you go to host your site

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,320
basically you don't have any public

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,050
addresses at home I'm sorry those have

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,180
been gone for years in fact a lot of

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,030
people don't even have more than one or

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,530
two at their office and so it's getting

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,780
more and more difficult to host site

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,850
because in order for you to have a site

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,250
that anybody can connect to you've got

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,340
to have a public address and those are

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,080
just about gone in ipv4 now so they're

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,390
even sharing public addresses now

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,000
hosting sites when you put your site up

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,230
you don't have your own ipv4 address

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,420
you're sharing it with a hundred or a

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,570
thousand other people and you can only

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,820
get at that site through the URL not

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,010
through an IP address and so this

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,900
complicates things and interestingly

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,900
enough going through that neck redress

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,870
translation server and now two layers of

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,380
it with what's called carrier grade nat

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:37,380
that slows things down so ipv6 is faster

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,960
if you want a really fast website deploy

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,020
out on ipv6 it'll speed up 20 or 30

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,850
percent just because it's on ipv6 okay

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,790
so that's one thing that might get your

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,740
attention but anyway basically the the

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:53,250
public addresses in ipv4 have been gone

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,550
since February 3rd 2011 at the Ayana

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,830
level and since then at the regional

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,440
internet registry levels ykp Nick and so

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,450
on they've run out one after another so

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,940
now when an ISP runs out of ipv4

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:09,960
addresses there's no more being made and

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,750
so um the I Anna and maybe Nick control

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,740
and tell him how about try ipv6 they've

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,360
been telling him that for a long time

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,440
and a lot of them were finally beginning

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,050
to do that ok now

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,479
[Music]

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,389
there we go okay so ipv4 has been around

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,490
since 1983 completely out of addresses

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,500
its own life support at this point and

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,570
yet this is what probably everybody in

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,589
here is hosting their websites on except

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,020
me but anyway ipv6 is the successor

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:44,140
protocol it's created by the ITF first

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,670
specified in 95 finally going live it

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,470
does pretty much the same thing but

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,350
there's an almost unlimited number of

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,899
public addresses and there's a lot of

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,800
other improvements to it too but even a

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,990
phone my phone has ipv6 from n1 I've got

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,050
2 to the 64th addresses on here

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,540
that's 18 quintillion times as many as

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,810
in the entire current internet my phone

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,839
has that on it ok and in fact I've got

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,700
ipv6 running on my note here because I'm

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,550
getting it in through m1 and sharing a

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,910
hotspot this computer now has ipv6 even

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,399
though I'm sorry the site doesn't but

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,910
anyway basically we're now in the

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,420
transition from ipv4 to ipv6 and we're

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,790
at about 28% 28% of all the traffic home

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,680
the global internet is now over ipv6 in

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,260
the next year or two that's going to go

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,610
over 50% because you've probably heard

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:43,420
of five g 5g is over ipv6 five G phones

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,640
and so as 5g is deployed it's going to

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,490
turn to a mostly ipv6 internet with

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,980
shrinking islands of ipv4 we're in the

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,500
final days of ipv4 yet with it guys

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,870
start supporting the future here okay

00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,850
now basically let's see okay I don't

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,770
really need to go into the private

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,649
addresses and so on but this will give

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,899
you a good idea here in a toe in a

00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,630
business office you have a real

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,279
telephone number and a PBX and behind

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,860
that you have extensions like extension

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,690
101 extension 102 and so on those are

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,579
not real telephone numbers nobody can

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,470
call it directly and in fact when you're

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,270
making an outgoing call if you've got

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,459
ten real phone numbers in that company

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,950
only 10 people can be making outgoing

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,270
calls even if you have a thousand people

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,420
11 one tries to make an outgoing call

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,310
dialing nine they get a busy signal so

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,210
there's a lot of problems with PBX is

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,310
but

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,470
the alternative is too expensive having

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,660
a real phone number for each employee

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,000
well NAT is the same way that basically

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,490
has one real address and then a lot of

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,960
extension addresses behind it people are

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,360
confused because they look like their

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,880
real addresses they used to be they got

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,790
repurposed to be extensions basically

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,130
and so when you have something in there

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,860
basically it cannot make any outgoing

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,540
connection itself are sorry you can make

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,339
an outgoing but you can't make an in

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,710
going connection to an internal one and

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,080
so you can't have a website running on

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,029
your home computer there's no way for

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,960
anybody to connect to that computer from

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:16,510
outside so today if you want to host a

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,089
WordPress website you've got to take it

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,490
to a Colo facility or web host or

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:23,470
whatever they've got a handful of ipv4

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,310
addresses and they do some very strange

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,320
things which slow it down even more to

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,600
actually access the the different

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,610
servers that they're hosting with ipv6

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,890
everybody can have a native address a

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,600
real public address and there's no

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,880
slowing down there's an interesting

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,370
little company called mythic beast out

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,709
there that has rack full of rack full of

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,930
little raspberry PI's each of which is

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:49,360
running its own copy of Linux and has an

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,200
a unique ipv6 address and they'll host

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,020
stuff on there for two pounds fifty

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,839
British a month because one of the main

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,360
cost at a hosting facility now is these

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,339
ancient and incredibly scarce ipv4

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,830
addresses so if you can get around

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,720
having that have ipv6 only hosting you

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,480
save a lot of money and it works

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,230
dramatically better so again we're at

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,150
the final days there so you can pay a

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,970
hosting facility a lot more money and

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,360
get a dedicated ipv4 address which they

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,940
charge a lot far and then publish that

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,140
in DNS then anybody can get to your site

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,200
you don't have to worry about sharing

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,820
your address with anybody else but

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,680
that's getting harder and harder because

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,990
the hosting facilities are all out of

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,260
ipv4 addresses they're getting more and

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,810
more difficult to do that but anyway a

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,060
few hosting facilities now that support

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,459
ipv6 some of the what some of the

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,050
sponsors here today do that talk with

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,770
exabytes I believe it is though they'll

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,000
be happy to

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:54,580
provide you with ipv6 hosting and I

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,550
happen to use vodiane here in Singapore

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,380
I've got three websites one for my

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,920
company and two personal ones that I run

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,750
that are running over ipv6 and it's very

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,580
easy to set up I really didn't have to

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,200
do that much work to to get it to work

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:13,180
so when you go to host your site one of

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,820
the most important questions is do you

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,700
support ipv6 a lot of the current ones

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,620
are going to say no but the ones that

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,440
have an eye to the future and so on

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,360
say sure we got it no additional charge

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,970
because the addresses are free unlike

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,340
ipv4 because there's they're not scarce

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,980
there's trillions of them okay so

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,260
basically that's one of the things you

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,120
should do and a lot of the hosting

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,310
people say oh well they haven't had

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,500
anybody asked for it yet people don't

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,850
know to ask for it okay they've never

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,970
heard of ipv6 so ask them you know start

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,430
creating the demand okay now you don't

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,600
post you don't host it on just ipv6

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,720
unless you're doing something very

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,930
unusual you do what's called dual stack

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,640
and so the ipv4 which is what most

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,010
people would connect to would be through

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,590
the layer after layer of NAT running

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:10,960
slow having you know technical problems

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:13,120
and so on the people that are up to

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,720
speed will have ipv6 and they'll connect

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,980
to the ipv6 and things work much better

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,010
you say well how many people have ipv6

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,350
right now about 28% of the people in the

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:27,580
world today have ipv6 and probably don't

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,350
even know it and so basically if you go

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,660
to mythic beast they'll be happy to

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,520
provide you with ipv6 only hosting but

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,250
you would be cutting out a lot of your

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,840
customers if you did that today one

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,750
interring thing is telephones are where

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,730
ipv6 is really taking off in the u.s. 90

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,610
to 95 percent of the telephones are

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,670
already on ipv6 many of them ipv6 only

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,520
and they used some cute technology to

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:56,080
allow the ancient legacy ipv4 only apps

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,060
to still run so anyway they say what do

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,019
you need to change in your web app to

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:04,000
support ipv6 the short answer is nothing

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,269
basically the hosting company has to be

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,240
running both ipv4 and ipv6 the addresses

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,560
have to be published in DNS Apache has

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,899
to be configured to support both

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,350
protocols your hosting provider can

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:20,140
easily do all of that so basically one

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,630
of the neat things is once you've got

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,279
Apache configured correctly anything

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,250
running on it including WordPress and

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,490
your applications require no changes

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,700
whatever so you can be up on to speed

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,579
just by finding a hosting provider that

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,760
supports ipv6 no changes to your site

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,930
whatever okay now if you've got ipv6 at

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,459
home you didn't actually run as many

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,350
public websites as you want

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:46,390
I've got APB six at home I've had is

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,079
since about 2004 but okay I'm a little

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:54,370
odd but basically in Singapore today

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:57,790
some of the wired internet providers are

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:02,260
supporting ipv6 ask around and get one

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:05,170
that does ok so how do you find ipv6 web

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,570
host errs google it you'll notice

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,579
there's something like 4.1 2 million

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,589
responses to that so this is not

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,839
something that is unheard of there's a

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:17,620
lot of people doing this and it doesn't

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,649
matter where your website is hosted of

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,740
course ok you can also use CloudFlare as

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:27,579
a CDN they automatically migrate or

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,950
convert all web sites to ipv6 so that's

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:33,370
the easy way to do it just you know get

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,589
cloud fair as a CDN here's the proof

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,600
that it's actually taking off these are

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,630
the people who are hitting google.com

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,029
over ipv6 you can see starting around

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:48,790
2014 it really started rising rapidly

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:51,660
we're at 28% as of January 2019 and it's

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:55,089
going up even faster now so basically

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,029
it's it's here it's no longer future

00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,500
technology it's the present technology

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,740
ok it's a lot of countries like Belgium

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,610
is already up to 64% Switzerland 53% and

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,300
so on the internet core is at 80%

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,160
so you know it's it's really taking off

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,070
on the global content these are the top

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,660
10 thousand websites 61% of them are run

00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:24,310
ie b6 okay it's on phones - this is my

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,590
android phone and my iPhone you can see

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,170
they both have real ipv4 addresses and

00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,030
one interesting thing is if I actually

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,470
try to ping those addresses from

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,610
anywhere else like for my Windows

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,130
computer it works

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,830
those are real global addresses okay

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,420
unlike phones up to now phones have only

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,210
had private addresses and they could

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,220
only make outgoing connections very

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,010
shortly here as people start getting

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,100
ipv6 on their phones you can run servers

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:54,790
on your phone if you want to okay now

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,430
most all most are all 5g some providers

00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,160
will be supporting ipv6 so that's

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,870
something to look forward to and for

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,020
more information I've got two websites

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:08,080
again third internet com it's the third

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,110
generation of the global Internet a lot

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,380
of advocacy deployments that's the

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,810
vision of what's coming and so on feel

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,490
free to check it out it's free it's

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,380
being hit by people over the world now

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,750
as you'll see on the next slide and then

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,090
v6 edu com is really the hardcore stuff

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,860
for the network engineers probably most

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,260
of the people in here won't be won't

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,420
need that but people like the top telco

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,700
engineers that seem tell them so um I

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,920
trained a lot of them in this and that's

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,050
that's that information that's there and

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,870
again that's being hit from all of the

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,360
world okay there's my coverage map

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,120
Concord internet comm you can see it's

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,340
really being hit by a lot of people and

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,100
so you know they're not so much in

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,230
Africa but some but most of the rest of

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,940
the world is fairly well covered

00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:00,310
so anyway okay so that's basically what

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,710
I want to tell you I strongly recommend

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,940
you look into it again there's almost no

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,490
effort involved in this

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,970
find yourself a hosting provider that

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,130
supports ipv6 use them you're done are

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,920
just go through a content provider like

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,330
clouds there in particular and so it's

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,850
not a tricky thing to do and it's we're

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,960
going to become more and more important

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,500
eventually we're gonna run out of ipv4

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,990
even for home with shared and so on and

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,360
so people are going to start getting

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,640
much cheaper internet by getting only IP

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,799
v6 once that starts happening if your

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,799
site is only an ipv4 they ain't got to

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,270
be able to reach you so just here's fair

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:42,070
warning it's coming okay so basically I

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,070
hope that gave you some interesting

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,110
insight that there's a major revolution

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,110
underway right now it's not no longer

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:54,429
future it's happening and it impacts how

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:58,210
you host these sites so I'll see just

00:19:54,429 --> 00:20:05,919
one quick last thing here basically just

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:08,140
to show you if I go to this is test ipv6

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,110
com sure enough right in here I've

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,799
actually got full working ipv6 and there

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,340
is my address

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:20,470
and let's see also if I go to my third

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:22,830
internet comm site well that's t6ed

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,830
ueuv7

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,840
okay so right there this is the PHP

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,670
function that shows your current IP

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,100
address of the person connecting to you

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,470
as you can see I'm connecting from ipv6

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,760
right from in here in this room and in

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,770
order to do that again I had to use a

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,760
hotspot on my phone because the Wi-Fi

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,340
here is in ipv6 but anyway so there's no

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,049
change at all to my code or to the

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,700
WordPress that's just standard WordPress

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:23,940
running at vodiane okay all right any

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:25,799
quick questions yes what no I'm

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,870
recommending you the dual stack right

00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,850
now which is what most of the hosting

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,240
providers are providing have both ipv4

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,309
and ipv6 and so basically they just they

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,160
add an ipv6 address to your existing

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,780
site no change is required but now

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:47,640
people will be able to access it if

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:51,030
they've got only ipv6 yes they'll

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,200
connect to the the old legacy ipv4 but

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,010
eventually there's going to be people

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,840
that have only ipv6 because you know

00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,400
it's just getting too expensive to keep

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,169
ipv4 on life support

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,790
so and more and more of it's going to be

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:04,559
shut down over the next few years in

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,470
fact there's a group that the IETF

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,049
called ipv4 sunset which is how to

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:14,980
cleanly and painlessly put ipv4 to sleep

00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:17,500
okay

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,260
and so you know we don't want to disrupt

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,240
things too much so but yeah ipv6 is the

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,210
future we'll probably have it till

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,740
around 2100 or so so you won't have to

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,970
go through this pain again any time soon

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:48,820
I don't have to worry about that okay

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:50,950
good question though okay basically my

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,560
own internet provider at home is my

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,470
republic they don't have ipv6 for home

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,500
networks yet so I had to actually get a

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,390
special router configure it and I tonal

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,420
in ipv6 from a company called hurricane

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,190
electric in the US so anybody wants to

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,630
do that the complete details and how you

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,880
set everything up its own third

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,680
internet.com there's a lot of recipes on

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,390
there on how to do things including how

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,570
to do ipv6 on AWS but StarHub and I

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,060
think m1 are already doing ipv6 at home

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:25,210
and on their you know their wired

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,170
networks and so just when you go to sign

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,790
up for an ISP ask them do you have ipv6

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,130
someone will say IP view what and you

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:35,440
know others will say yeah we've had it

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:41,820
for years so go for one that's had it

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,820
for years okay what

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,250
I've got gigabit you say bandwidth hole

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,650
benefits

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,680
well first off I develop a lot of ipv6

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,690
software at the office and so I've got

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,620
ipv6 running there too I have since

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:06,410
again 2004 and so I have to have ipv6 to

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,890
test things on and so on at home I

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,450
actually now every node in my home I can

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,880
access from anywhere in the world I

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,100
could bring up RDP here and talk to my

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,780
computer on my desk at home even though

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,910
it's not you know it doesn't have any

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,390
public ipv4 address it's got a public IP

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:26,150
v6 and so there's a lot of advantages to

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,220
running ipv6 at home and you can

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,200
actually run multiple subnets you could

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,200
have one for the parents one for the

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,760
kids one for your Smart TV isolate them

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,260
and so on so you don't have to worry

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,900
about so many getting in your Smart TV

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,520
and seeing the rest of your network so a

00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,240
lot of advanced things you can do with

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,370
ipv6 eventually everybody will have it

00:24:43,240 --> 00:25:00,080
okay but right now it's kind of

00:24:45,370 --> 00:25:02,390
transition yeah yes by default you go

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,190
get ipv6 there you have to kind of twist

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,410
their arm right now eventually they'll

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,620
probably give it to everyone but if you

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,720
call them up and say I want ipv6 on my

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,710
site they might grumble a little bit but

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,610
they'll give it to you at no additional

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,650
charge okay there are other website

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,130
co-students that just include it by

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,010
default

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,020
I believe exabyte I'm not sure you can

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:28,660
ask them they're out there I believe

00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,660
they support ipv6 for their facilities

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,820
yeah basically once your hosting

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,740
facility turns it on for you you don't

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,110
have to make any changes your own the

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,530
third internet and anybody will be able

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,110
to connect you over ipv6 and of course

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,360
also through the old legacy stuff with

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:51,250
the NAT and the way and so on but the

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,250
ipv6 will actually be higher performance

00:25:51,870 --> 00:26:03,370
ya know you still need domains domains

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:07,780
are kind of above the level of IP but in

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:10,000
DNS you can actually provide the what's

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,430
called a quad a record for the ipv6 and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,120
an a record for the ipv4 and when

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,160
somebody connects whichever one ipv6

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:25,090
rep48 will find you and connect you

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:27,100
still need a domain yeah you have both

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,420
the ipv6 address and the ipv4 address

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,610
and the client will get the right one

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,720
and connect I don't know if we've got

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:50,590
more time but we've got more questions

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:53,530
apparently yeah yeah each one could have

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,750
a global address on one machine unlike

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,570
ipv4 where you can only have one address

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,700
per machine with ipv6 I can have as many

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,750
public addresses that you want on one

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,670
computer okay so yeah you could easily

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,130
have each one have unique public address

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:12,690
even without you know having multiple

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,690
machines or virtual machines or whatever

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:23,160
the what host headers I think they do in

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,320
fact some of the posting providers that

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,020
are providing ipv6 believe it or not

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,360
they're sharing ipv6 addresses because

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:34,170
that's the way they know to do things

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,610
and so you know they really don't need

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,400
to do that they could provide each

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,980
customer with a unique ipv6 address per

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,810
website and then you know there's no

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,330
question of whether you have a shared

00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,850
address or a private address you know

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,220
our dedicated one order all ipv6

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,860
addresses should be dedicated there's no

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,660
excuse for sharing an ipv6 address it's

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,160
like sharing a grain of sand at the

00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,770
beach you know so okay now I'll be

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,720
around the rest of today and also I'll

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,330
be around tomorrow if you have any other

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,000
