00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,789
re I'm Henry so it's very small then so

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,360
I've been five years in e-commerce so as

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:52,199
we give multiple ecommerce platform such

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,449
as Amazon eBay cadenza carousel shall be

00:00:52,199 --> 00:01:00,329
but you left out the most important one

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:02,670
what is that WooCommerce all right it's

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,380
my favorite right and I run a multiple

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:11,250
seven figures ecommerce businesses with

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:15,060
about 300 people on my team and honestly

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,530
I'm just a regular guy don't mean

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,970
differences you know I really learned

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,640
ecommerce and you're not really

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,780
passionate about it and I've been truly

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,290
up and downs real downs of being a

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,460
business so I cannot feel that I think I

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,329
have the kind of authority the kind of

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:42,360
share view you know about being in

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:46,049
business so what is hustle hustle right

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,610
you know it came from this talk hustling

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:54,060
parcel of you know driving city is

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,180
actually about being in a state of great

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,430
activities of you constantly you know

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,900
working hard constantly being busy

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,710
something in your business west

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,570
bootstrapping

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,540
so bootstrapping is basically you are

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,050
starting a business with existing

00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,740
resources usually maybe most of the miss

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,610
you are using whatever money you have

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:24,090
whatever resources you have in your own

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,390
capacity to start a business and what

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,490
you are doing is usually you are

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,380
reinvesting the profits back into the

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,130
business usually a very high percentage

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,950
so hope you rather this is in awesome

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,490
and are you guys doing this as well

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,340
I'm sure you can understand what I'm

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,040
trying to tell you so the founders take

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,050
a rest most every right you guys can be

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,240
dressing up in suits like myself by

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,920

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,680
about everything right sure hope you can

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,080
understand me on that and of course the

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,350
upside is that that's very low financial

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,360
risk right what if if everything you

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,430
know doesn't work out you know that you

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,420
you don't you're not losing a lot of

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,019
things right so today you know I'm

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,930
challenging the dangerous known people

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:23,640
are saying that you know I've heard some

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:27,209
of these these famous that are saying

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,970
you sleep sleep is overrated

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,470
all right you can sleep and die but

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,070
you're did you can see when you update

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,739
now right you guys are whatever you have

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,080
time in your mind you should be hustling

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,590
working hypothesis right about passing

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,500
that if you're not hustling you're

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,790
losing that means what if you are not

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,940
working a young reezy now so and smart

00:03:50,790 --> 00:04:00,150
work will never replace hard work it

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:03,060
only supplement see our user of this is

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,920
being sick my mother very popular kind

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,310
on YouTube right now so who is he

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,580
if you are not working 15 to 18 hours a

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:21,820
day you know about me enough with your

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:27,050
life oh this guy oh you know I so so so

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:30,919
right Gary Vaynerchuk so he's right

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,770
internet person LP prominent advocate of

00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:37,340
this being called the hustle pawn right

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:41,330
it's about cooking hard right and and

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,970
you know oh that's all he does and you

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,800
know people believe in 10 which is not

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,169
wrong I you know I definitely believe

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,220
that people should be working

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:56,900
definitely but between working high or

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:02,450
working smart right look at this wood

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:05,270
here right good smug it is to versa well

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,390
that's the first one okay if you are not

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,180
working you cannot be working smart

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:14,630
understand so you need to be working so

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,590
between these two you guys should be

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,030
working smart right you should be

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,080
working for sure

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,330
otherwise you cannot maybe even run a 72

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,550
business or something like that

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,490
you should be working but you have to be

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,669
working smart as well okay so if you are

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:39,110
working do you think all your time is

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:43,490
being spent on being efficient and

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:46,370
effective if you are working 18 hours do

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:52,840
you sleep 6 hours what are they

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:55,010
okay do you think that you can be

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,890
efficient Trotta

00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:02,720
eight hours do you think you can be

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:07,880
efficient you can be effective in this

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,279
18 hours so what is the real working

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,999
hours that you actually put

00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:16,349
this business maybe it's only six hours

00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:19,689
and the other 12 hours you are not being

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,649
utilizing them in the best possible way

00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,499
right

00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,969
so the and the other bit about

00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:28,659
bootstrapping right so there are two

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:33,189
extremes of how each opinions spend

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:36,339
money okay so there are this one grow

00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:40,269

something handsome as well right

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,320
but for inspectors you need to spend

00:08:53,339 --> 00:09:00,690
from really I mean spent appropriately

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,130
okay so the key word here is balance the

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,850
key word is balance

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:09,839
okay I belong to the Drifters okay

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,540
and when my business started to sort of

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,190
become stabilized I started to make some

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:21,810
money right one thing that I stop myself

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:25,709
from kind of how to tell myself okay I

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:30,900
should stop worried about money in this

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:33,810
aspect and one of them he he comes is

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,690
actually food is actually food way

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,970
person food you know maybe up when I go

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,660
for let's say I tell my my business go

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,050
for you know I don't think about the

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,430
money

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:50,520
you know I don't think about the money

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:54,540
in the expect me is that my my

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:59,700
refrigerator right one thing that I do

00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,200
is that I view it up with beverages so

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
then when you eat up right then when I

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,279
opened my refrigerator

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,279
I feel like actually about doing that

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,470
okay so what keeping is you're gonna be

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:19,160
balanced right the key words balance and

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:23,100

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,290
okay so the thing is that you can let me

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,070
go through some all right do you wanna

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,350
live like this right variables name you

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,700
know the pursuit of happiness and hope

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,560
you watch the movie

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,790
the pursuit of happiness so there's this

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,829
particular scene which is very sad I can

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,890
remember the guys name but you know he

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:35,280
brought his son into bringing to the

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,860
basically he he kind of told to his son

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,900
his right is a jungle or something like

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,770
that and then he sort of trick his son

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,600
to go into the public washroom in the

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,209
subway station

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,339
and he spent the night there because he

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,930
could have fought ran he could have

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,090
fought a night

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,090
motel or something again so it's very

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,190
sad right

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:03,150
quite quite a very Lulu pointless life

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:07,620
right so myself right hustling and you

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:09,150
know bootstrapping it took solve the

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,860
best years of my life movie as well

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:17,040
right maybe a bit of an alien of course

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:20,730
it's not that better but if I just try

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,340
to exaggerate be so I hustled for about

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,340
four years of my life right I stopped

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,070
taking the subway in fact so if you guys

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,320
think you are the truth I might read

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:37,710
more than you like my probably caught

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:40,320
the mises - end of the trip I stopped

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:45,930
taking the subway you know I started to

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:51,090
cycle to everywhere I had peanut butter

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:55,830
sandwich almost every meal for like I

00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:59,210
think 18 months I'll see you know it

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:02,390
comes to the point where you just don't

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:06,650
you just can't taste anything anymore

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,480
you know it gets told that that only

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:13,050
does this sound like an interesting

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,840
story to you okay maybe maybe Netflix

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:23,360
will call me abandoned you know ask me

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:27,210
hey let's do a TV series going I mean so

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,640
does this study writing from the

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,380
American psychiatrist Association they

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,750
say they're you know fifteen to sixteen

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,810
point six percent of the general

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,820
population suffer from depression so you

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,430
know IG above all then is suffer from

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:46,500
depression correct but the thing is this

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:49,320
you look at the entrepreneur's we are

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,340
two times more likely to suffer from

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,640
depression than the general population

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,890
yes I know this this what

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,320
we'll come here right today you guys

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,470
come here to learn about stuff I want to

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,230
talk about something real in your life

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,290
in your business life as well okay so

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,470
and then that's another I think this in

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,950
taxes for a file they actually did a

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:18,500
survey I think so they said that 45% of

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,279
entered premiums report that they feel

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:27,019
stress nephew stress and the leaf four

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:30,560
percent of them were real all right I'm

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:35,540
sure a lot of you are also feeling

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:39,320
stress a lot of times right and the

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:44,180
glory of entrepreneurship leaves the

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:48,170
feeling of being lanta right most people

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:51,890
find they think entrepreneur's feels

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,769
like even so that means up outside of us

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,500
at all right if all of you I also was

00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:00,440
right you know

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,230
let's say you find you trying to date

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,699
someone ready someone who has a regular

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,360
job baby

00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:11,269
if you that alien like an Indian you

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,820
know and for myself you know I think

00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:17,149
that you know my healthy take a hit as

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:21,260
well I was working this about hours or

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:23,480
15 to 18 velocity and I think some

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,390
people know me could testified and when

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,269
I was building up my business at a

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,029
part-time and then I was sleeping very

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,699
little and I was sleeping like five six

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,430
six hours a day you know I was eating

00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:40,430
unhealthily wine because if you stress

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:44,860
right some people with a few stress they

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:48,980
don't even which is very lucky for them

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,410
belong to you I feel stress you know

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,360
just interval and and now you have

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,889
actually spending a lot of time trying

00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,230
to regain my health and that's me

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,120
you know that's me on the right and see

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,160
this Scott daughter I know this is a

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,149
three taken like two or three years back

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,170
when when Pokemon go or I just launched

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:16,910
me so I was I was playing those that was

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:21,560
me you know I look good right and that's

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:25,279
me now okay so do you really want to

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,949
make all that money and have no hair to

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,740
enjoy and not just how I'm only

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:32,839
mentioning about health here but there's

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,149
a lot of things you might not just be

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,880
giving up you might be giving up

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:42,019
relationship with your family you might

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,199
be giving up time spending on other

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:47,360
passions in your life maybe love to play

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,100
sports or something like that you might

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,569
be giving that up as well right so if

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,269
you are not if you are constantly

00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:59,110
hustling you are not doing it right

00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,880
that's what I feel that's why I feel

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,819
this is everything here is really my

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,910
opinion right I'm just telling you my

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,339
opinion and you if you strongly against

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,189
what we're gonna say then it's okay

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:16,280
right you can have the 1p yeah I thought

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,549
we only own opinion right so you have to

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:24,079
not pop you delegate and manage that's

00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:27,140
why view right time money how to

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,049
leverage time and learn how to leverage

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,840
money so leverage time by learning how

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:38,270
to hire delegate and manage learn how

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,419
leverage money by learning how to get

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:44,990
funding okay

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:48,140
money is not like your personal savings

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:51,950
to use it to be your business okay you

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,269
can use other people's money to do it as

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,489
well so of course this the

00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,429
stopping them no tapas that's nothing

00:17:56,489 --> 00:18:01,529
you doing funding but you guys can you

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:05,519
know after you go back can learn about

00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:07,289
then okay so I have in fact because

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,719
nowadays I'm actually at a point where

00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,339
coaching I'll be able to to be building

00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:15,089
our own e-commerce business and in fact

00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:17,519
one of my students right he he has a

00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:21,929
full-time job so he has a full-time job

00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:25,559
and he he actually has a ecommerce

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:29,940
business doing about 100,000 in revenue

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:32,369
per year annually and he's able to have

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,709
a full time job and run his business

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:38,969
because why because he knows how to

00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:43,469
leverage other people's time to do this

00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:44,729
okay right and right you can let her get

00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:48,779
funding through these kind of things

00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:53,249
like loans and iPod de okay so quality

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:55,440
over quantity okay so it's important to

00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:58,229
get more of something that to get few

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,599
things that are high quality is often

00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:03,769
used to hurry people up and encourage

00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,089
people to get something done oh yeah I

00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:09,539
don't I don't know what this guy's about

00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:13,589
does my my designer it is right back you

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:16,229
saw that you saw that you know that the

00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:19,649
Jeep there I think a lot of you were

00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:23,820
seen before like good cheap cheap man

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:26,159
what a bad quality and then I heard oh

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,349
yeah but like we did the tree you can

00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,379
only just do something you cannot you

00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:34,379
cannot take everything right always

00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:36,239
trying to choose quality over on the

00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:39,149
deep sea seem like what I mentioned

00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:44,700
right you know when you spend time in

00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:47,609
your business focus on being effective

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,249
being efficient with the hours that you

00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:52,919
put in it's not about you putting a lot

00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:56,179
of time inside this business okay

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,240
for example although I I don't think I'm

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:01,720
suitable who uses and

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,590
but imagine you go to the gym okay

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,240
imagine you go to I try to go to gym now

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,450
by magic good og my duty

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,420
you good a gym for let's say 12 hours or

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,760
14 hours which is unrealistic or for

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,300
sure but if you just spend 14 hours in

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,720
the gym

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:22,560
okay and the Knicks and then used you

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,390
don't believe gym for the next 13 days

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,510
right so for the next two weeks you go

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,960
to the gym at all compared to you going

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,330
to the gym and our day for the next two

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,050
weeks which do you think will give you a

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:41,470
better result and why right so it's

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:44,950
about you even if you spending just a

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,650
few hours on your business every day

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,750

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,300
time right we need those hours you are

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,700

you okay are you happy you know I should

00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:08,000
not have give up anything just for

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,070
business or financial success I will

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,690
only choose everything if I mean by this

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:17,180
is this between all this that I

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,290
mentioned money family and friends have

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,170
passions and interests business a lot of

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:28,190
times a lot of times that people who are

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:30,920
running businesses rightly you know the

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:35,120
be sacrificed they say no no all this is

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,160
not important right business is my focus

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,730
right now I'm going to put all my time

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,130
all my focus into into my personal space

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,180
right and then everything else I'll

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,700
leave it for next time but I feel

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,580
differently I feel then you can have

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:56,060
everything I feel that you can have

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,590
everything yes maybe you know it is easy

00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,900
for you right when you focus on

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,700
something if you know you will get very

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,400
good results but it's difficult for you

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,620
to you know try to balance everything up

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
right so if you put all your focus into

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,130
business definitely you will achieve

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,560
that success but you will do some

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,480
everything else okay you can't have

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,460
everything right you just need to have

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,950
the mindset of trying to balance

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:24,530
everything okay so examine your own life

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,620
and business model is where where you

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,660
are now and what you are doing daily

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,050
okay where you are now and what you're

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,770
doing daily is that going to lead you to

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:42,350
this happy life that you painted in your

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:44,770
mind okay you are a lot to enjoy the

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,980
journey as well as the fruits of your

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,810
labor

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,020
okay you enjoy

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:54,620
as well right so pretty much that's all

00:23:51,020 --> 00:24:10,130
mine that's my last line right so should

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:14,750
we take questions now I will strip it

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:16,430
cost after low financial risk so I

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,310
always have this impression that when

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,380
you leverage on funding on effectors you

00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,780
are actually more stressed because you

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:27,260
have to change their habits and you are

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,610
no longer going to show it no one to

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,860
give you the money they are the ones

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:35,000
calling the shots so there's no evidence

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,640
of it okay firstly you're a great

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,050
question live direct a quick question

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,660
okay so the thing is that for me why I

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,280
would say right when do you start to get

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,120
funding or Louise it's kind of going to

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,160
slide into them then configure it but

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,860
what I'm translate is that once you have

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,340
have a business model that is already

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,710
working

00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,530
you are considered that this works okay

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,360
what you wanna do next right is this is

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,860
at least and this point right you should

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,320
be looking and using other people's

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,810
money and then you know try to flush out

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,470
whatever is is is inside your business

00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:15,020
now okay one very good way to get some

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,180
small small funding to your business

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,760
without feeling when stress is friends

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,930
and family and then something like my

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,280
friends that when the ag-1

00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:27,050
you know I want to do you know stress

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,780
them or whatever you should think this

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:33,890
way your business is already making

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,240
money you are now helping your friends

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,600
and family but you want to have the

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,480
fresh

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,640
to make some money as well right right

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,380
on your success right now giving them

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,299
some interest as well you're not pouring

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,580
money and then don't pay them or don't

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,440
just beat under principle when you

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,900
borrow money okay so one way that I do

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,350
it in my business is like this so let's

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,090
say maybe I go to my hand right so she's

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,940
not married and so of course she could

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:02,360
be more cash on hand so what I do is I

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,410
go as fatherly can you you know my

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,309
business is going well

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:10,909
I need more money to kind of read more

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:13,100
stable you know could you lend me 10,000

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,289
all right let me $10,000

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,409
after six months I start to pay you

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,990
monthly right until the end of the year

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,490
right there are impacted principle so

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,950
what I'll do is there a quick look at

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,070
the back of the register personal memory

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,380
so at the time it was about six to seven

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,419
percent now is I think it's very good so

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,789
you guys want to you know grow a

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:36,679
business somewhere you can cook they're

00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:38,690
loaning money tonopen is only about four

00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,220
percent right now which is very low so

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,980
energy brought that thousand dollars are

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,010
you only pay six for $400 on my times

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,990
six and all is $12 you can use that

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,010
articles and big more than four dollars

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,530
very easily

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,039

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,309

I mean I put my hand right there ask for

00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,430
