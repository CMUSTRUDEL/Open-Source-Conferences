Title: Hazrul Azhar Jamari: Comparing WooCommerce SaaS vs Managed Woocommerce Hosting
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	Hazrul was the creator behind rezkii.com, a defunct woocommerce-as-a-service product. He feels WooCommerce is really painful for regular people to start a store and hosted platforms like Shopify are taking a lot from Woo’s pie. But have the industry caught up?
This presentation is a comparison of Managed WooCommerce Hosting (Pantheon, Nestify) and WooCommerce-as-a-service solutions (Woocart). It describes similarities and differences, and what it means to the non-techies who wish to use WooCommerce as their tech stack for their e-Commerce business.
And he will also make a comparison between Woocart vs Shopify vs Ecwid and discuss the similarities and differences of each platform.
Is Woocart the answer? Will Woocommerce ever go towards Woo-as-a-service? Perhaps there’ll be more questions than answers. Find out in this talk.

Singapore I gave a talk about how I

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,979
think we're almost going to be disrupted

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,680
by Shopify we can scan that QR code it

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,979

directly and you can listen to my rant

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:28,619
about commas okay and this talk would be

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,630
a continuation of it and hopefully

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,030
there's going to be some insights about

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,100
about who comments that has changed okay

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:45,180

w CSG 19 and I said no question for me

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,340
you prefer to use to oppress or calm for

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,950
your website so sauce is basically

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,270
things that host it right this is stop

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,310

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,000
yourself self hosted right just like to

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,780
know what people are thinking right now

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,780
there's some reason that's not working

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,760
there you go

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,760
hopefully that looks

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:35,860
Oh where's that working still

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:40,390

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,390
there we go alright one in one

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,250
so dog versus cog which one do you

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,250
prefer to use

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,930
right a lot of people that like to

00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,410
download stuff and install it yourself

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,160
okay

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,600
hello what do you tell people Wow is it

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,660
this Hungry Ghost moderates and I'm

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:14,470
living seeing things okay that did give

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,470
it another minute I guess

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,330
all right 15 I think this kind of like

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,970
gives an idea of the state of the room

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,590
right now I gives a lot more people more

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,110
technical the electric download style

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,620
they'll play around with the code and

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,300
see what happens right okay great so

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,900
that gives me I do the top people

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,890
they're here

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,440
okay so Luca massage what exactly is it

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,940
software as a service so if you are

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,410
familiar with Converse plugins you know

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,750
you have to download the plug-in here to

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,550
install you onto your WordPress and then

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,459
activate it you have to configure it a

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,930
bunch of stuff I have to set up your

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,980
products the prices of products

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,650
discounts couponing shipping methodology

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,540
how you're going to take all this are

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,070
going to do refunds while your payment

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,580
gateways and so on so forth

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:11,530
okay so I need to shut down my

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:17,519
messengers in a moment

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,519
well I kill all these messages

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:28,810
okay so back into 1815 I actually built

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,500
a MOOC on the sass it no longer

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,420
functions

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:38,110
I saw the business to somebody else and

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,360
I became part of that company but two

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,480
years later died so it's a bit sad I

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,050
didn't get to continue my work on

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,340
WooCommerce ass but somebody else

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,740
somewhere else around the world decided

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,400
to pick up on it and do something about

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,350
it

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:59,740
this guy's hookah from Slovenia and I

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:03,190
had a chat with the founder day on Leon

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,830
Marco had an hour and half chat with him

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,220
talk about how I did work on the sauce

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,770
and the kind of learnings that I had and

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,470
one reasons why I wanted to do a massage

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,880
was because I really hate WooCommerce

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,470
when I start out doing WordPress

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,200
WooCommerce wasn't my first choice it

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,970
was a she WP engine and new zealand vs

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,030
plug-in with károly plug-in I really

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,350
like and then when automatic what will

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,740
commerce over and became the de facto

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,830
standard so well you've got it

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,150
2news extended right and then he had a

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,560
lot of support and all that kind of

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:45,370
stuff so yeah I didn't really like it

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:49,390
that much but I had to do wait to do one

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:53,260
thing that I hated most about McComas

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,720
was that shipping shipping

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,940
configurations are not very good it's

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,650
only fixed rate and flat rates either

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,850
sorry free of flattery

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,590
so inside a free shipping of flex

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,190
shipping right which doesn't work in

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,090
most cases in e-commerce today so

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:13,660
normally shipping is a platform shipping

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,630
although Commerce has a way to install

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,060
your dish or your ups or not lose are

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,280
very North American centric right for us

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,020
in this part of the world not really

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,120
okay so you don't have your simple slide

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,979
you don't have your you know post

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,400
mashaallah and all that you know so you

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,900
probably need to install another plugin

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,129
and then figure out your tiered pricing

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,469
for yourself so that's that's a

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,989
pain to the figuration we stopped in all

00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:41,599
right so I try to resolve that problem

00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:43,519
and that's why I sold my company to a

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,439
shipping or a logistics company because

00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,349
they were doing a shipping then I had

00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,969
the shipping automated for me right so

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,550
that didn't turn out well look around

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:55,849
their hand came from a different

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,499
paradigm the obese new Europe so be

00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:00,080
talking just this to cotton

00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:03,709
wordpress.com when I talked about this

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,449
issue back in 2017 WooCommerce office

00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:09,259
service on WordPress platform wasn't

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:11,899
exactly there right you could install

00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,330
WooCommerce yeah but it wasn't really as

00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:18,830
kind of feel to it it's not like Shopify

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,279
or ECU it right so let's see what's

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,039
under the hood

00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:29,029
Edie ok ok so this is a video of me

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,529
playing around you cut right so what's

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,349
under the hood this is what you get when

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:36,619
you sign up on whoo car it's different

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:38,689
from your WooCommerce interface so you

00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:41,539
can set up your domain immediately from

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,629
your settings and the add-on you can use

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:49,939
your SendGrid so emo transactions is

00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:52,669
part of who can backup is part of Luca

00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:57,469
you can take a look at what plugins are

00:07:52,669 --> 00:08:02,089
there what kind of matrices on your page

00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:05,809
and there's a CLI vini okay I mean

00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:10,479
accidentally tap on that sorry it's a

00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,479
lot more maybe does speed things up

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:28,670
okay all right I hope to us okay so CLI

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:32,060
and then you got your IRA locks

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,040
alright and traffic management as well

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,320
so a lot of things come under the hood

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,750
in hookah

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
what it does is basically it's more like

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,820
a dashboard for server management

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,770
alright when you say now look at you

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,260
immediately get a star just like Shopify

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,670
so start is immediately created for you

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,620
and is the first thing that you see and

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,170
then I can go immediately to my site

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,750
right and everything is already

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,420
pre-configured done very nice very sweet

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,210
alright so this is all the basic data so

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,440
it's demo data you need to setup your

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,810
own products later but you see

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
immediately how a stove will do like

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,410
okay and then you can immediately go

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,980
into your WordPress back-end okay

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,560
so it's using as this a stri thing for

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,060
the team's a default team the first

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,410
dashboard interface is slightly

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,920
different so you modify the - more a

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,950
little bit okay but everything else is

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,540
basically WooCommerce vanilla alright so

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,980
what it means is that well they do

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,780
really resolve the problem of shipping

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,270
because that's the most painful part for

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,760
me all right

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,680
demons well do everyone repayments

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,990
before a stripe people and so on okay

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,520
but the tractors of a bit yet what

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,280
shipping so a lot of things already

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,730
pre-configured into the zones and then

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:54,130
just no new stuff from there okay so I

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,990
wouldn't want to delve more into this

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,750
let's look at what WordPress is done so

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,320
a couple years later shop if I broke up

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:08,270
with WordPress and you can no longer put

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:13,100
a Shopify links on to the press and vice

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:16,310
versa so that happened and what prize

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,390
decided to go away and add their own

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:24,100
thing

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:28,040
oh it's not working anymore okay okay so

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,009
wordpress.com what I like about

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,769
wordpress.com is that you know is

00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:36,170
WordPress interface wordpress.com

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,660
interface so this is what you know my

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,689
very own blog is like so I'm just gonna

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,470
click on a plan yeah okay this is don't

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:44,660
seen this before

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,350
yeah so this is WordPress that comes own

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,029
interface okay so everybody knows what

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,860
it looks like I'm just going to move

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:57,019
over to the gay everybody knows the

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,720
customizer everybody knows the plugins

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,600
and you know - okay so so you want to

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,059
install WooCommerce right yes it was

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,569
there a bit okay you want to install

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:10,100
WooCommerce it's not on your free plan

00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:13,579
there for plans are luke wordpress.com

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,009
so you need to at least be on the

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,839
business plan all right there are two

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,970
plants that support you Commerce is

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,549
either the business plan or the

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,339
e-commerce plan the differences are in

00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,989
really mostly in terms of support

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,689
everything else well that's the same in

00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:32,110
my opinion okay let's see how much that

00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,110
cost

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:47,350
the stop so business plan costs $35 per

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:49,690
month built annually okay so you get a

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,170
free domain get everything in jetpack

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:57,460
which I hate also email a live chat

00:11:53,170 --> 00:12:00,340
support unlimited premium themes so a

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,230
lot of free themes on WordPress okay

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,760
okay la the premiums are the ones that

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,060
said I really nice right so unlimited

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,540
premium themes a good thing okay and

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,280
then the e-commerce plans $63 per month

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,230
Wow

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,530
okay so we got everything in business

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,370
plan and so forth obviously I did not

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,020
buy and give it a spin because I cannot

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,120
afford it that's why I'm looking for a

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,640
job

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,330
okay so just quickly look at how much it

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,230
costs per year okay so I have some

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,850
credits apparently

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,350
so if I don't have credits it's gonna

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,360
cost me 48 52 bucks for 20 bucks and

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,550
then you know if I'm on the e-commerce

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,530
panel you pretty much double the costs

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:51,100
okay so skip that one

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:55,000
so basically SAS is all about signing up

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,950
an email address and then clicking to

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,500
three pages and that's it you get a

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,940
stock immediately and just start selling

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,250
almost immediately you don't need to

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,850
configure servers right that's what you

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,830
want because you know business people

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,740
don't want to stress about Oh who's

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:15,190
going to take care of myself who's going

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,860
to support you know my website and all

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,280
that everything to do the sauce is as a

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:26,530
service know nobody needs to doubt the

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:28,540
code okay that's nice but most people

00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,970
like us developers want to mess with

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,210
code as you can see that's not about 17

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,030
people like the massive code so what's

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,310
the in-between for me that sugamice

00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,440
managed hosting and other words i'm

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,840
gonna talk about today a pension and st

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,740
vitus probably a lot of their responses

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,360
like SiteGround

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,450
you know Bluehost and all that you've

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,320
probably got somebody shooting I saw but

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,820
the ones that I'm going to talk about

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,830
are these two went in and testify

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,670
because I kind of think that they have a

00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:04,540
very nice tool kit all right so let's

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:09,220
talk about pension first okay went in so

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,450
just a three-minute video about pension

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,400
this is what you get after you sign up

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,070
takes less than a minute sign up you've

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,330
got multiple definis development staging

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:23,590
and life which is great right you can

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:28,400
commit code to jit which is nice right

00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:31,730
or SFTP one SFTP this status is to tell

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,490
you whether some jobs are not done or

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,970
plugins are broken and so on error logs

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:41,300
which is very nice we can add new means

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:44,000
and buy or prepare your SSL right

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,900
seamlessly through Pantheon backups are

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,680
inbuilt okay and configure your security

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,410
settings and this new relic already part

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,120
of this dashboard alright so what

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,800
happens is that when it's alphabetic

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,250
immediate you get a site which is really

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,850
nice

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:07,190
okay so you have your vanilla WordPress

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,870
but you don't have a comma set so they

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,510
don't have a way to set up will commence

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,950
immediately but at least we got your

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,890
WordPress site immediately which is very

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,180
nice okay so if we wanted to install

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,430
WooCommerce you need to go to the

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,720
plugins repository again and then just

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,080
install WooCommerce you should not that

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,020
bad

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,970
alright but everything else is still

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,530
vanilla and it doesn't really solve your

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,780
shipping issues and so on where he at

00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,550
least you know your steps to launch a

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,750
faster this is slightly different for

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,170
your 1-click installs on your

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:39,230
rudimentary shared hosting service what

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,300
these guys do is that they create a nice

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,960
environment for developers like us to

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,000
really develop my double your site on

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,070
the environment so you prepare all the

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,320
nice environments for you def staging

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,730
and life so you really do all that kinda

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,750
stuff that you need to do and Tesla's

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,910
the kind of stuff that you need a test

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,740
before I go to production this is me

00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,880
testing out the JIT so I just Jake load

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,530
onto my low

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,310
go and then just change something and

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:10,220
then I just need to add a little line

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:16,100
there okay to make that change so I'm

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,470
going to type echo hello okay and see

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,900
whether you know the EBUS were really

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,710
claims to do okay

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm going to jit add and Jake commit and

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:36,610
then Jake push by faster ah okay all

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,930
right okay at the type in a password I

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,010
don't need the time pass but if you've

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,360
already added your what you call your

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,590
keys inside

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,970
right and then let's see what it change

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,220
okay

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:57,910
oh is it was it refresh lat refresh

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,620
okay so I have to refresh a few times I

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,050
actually wondered whether it was inside

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,550
the code didn't really see it there so

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:10,160
yeah no not there

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:14,660
so it took a bit of time for JIT to

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:18,949
really propagate okay and they go okay

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,589
three so it does work okay so that's

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,600
that's Penton okay

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,550
very nice dashboard very clean very

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,470
pleasing to the eye and so easy to

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:33,200
understand okay so this is great for

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,930
agencies if you are agency pentia

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,120
actually has an agency plan alright so

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,040
they're this Carter plans your agency

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,600
and then just on board new clients

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,290
through your own dashboard so you can

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,410
pack everything into your own

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,870
organization

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,940
alright as supposed to be having a VPS

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,980
and then load up you know your separate

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,040
WordPress or commerce sites and then try

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,570
to manage everything by yourself which

00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,250
is what you don't want to do you know as

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,190
developers you just want to coat we

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,730
don't want to care about you know

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,010
maintaining your service

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,300
ok so with these guys you don't need to

00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,640
maintain service and you maintain it for

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,040
you ok and just need to code just need

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,230
to push things to check all right so

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,880
let's look at Nesta fie

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,990
next if I is very similar to Pantheon

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,980
slightly longer videos I try to speed it

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,720
up a bit

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,130
one thing I like about Nesta Phi is that

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,090
you can actually choose where you want

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,280
to host your service

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,370
so being used to have a Singapore bit so

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,920
that you don't have that and we have

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,240
WooCommerce as a default so you can just

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,130
like WooCommerce I said before and it

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,080
immediately become is also pre-installed

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,050
together alright so right now that's

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,940
processing processing ok and you know

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,850
doing its magic at the back and

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,460
launching stuff launching your WordPress

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,320
and WooCommerce into their service I'm

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,100
just gonna speed it up a bit and they go

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,650
ok so launch servers are launched all

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:02,750
right don't worry Bela password you know

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:05,710
anyway as I was there also which is nice

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,710
let's redirect rules so you can actually

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,630
modify your redirect goes directly

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,900
they've got cash their wish and they

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,550
didn't have okay and then you can choose

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,030
your PHP version switch Penton also

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,970
didn't have all right and we have JIT

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,980
which is what all there's like to do for

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,620
version control and can copy include

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,700
eatable switch Benton actually just not

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,010
didn't have but they have database

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,110
access and painting as well last if I

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,590
has PHP by and mean Penta didn't have

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,360
but it doesn't really matter if you know

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,260
your database of things right if you

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,890
want paint in earlier

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,870
okay so this is my uh commerce site okay

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:50,890
if I'm going to login into the admin

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:54,020
panel I would get vanilla WordPress

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:57,920
panel so nothing fancy there not like we

00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:00,050
can all right okay but you still need to

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,590
do that one thing install WooCommerce

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:05,750
admit before it's properly installed so

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,210
slight difference on size is there you

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,180
don't even need to run this sauce

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,600
everything is already done that part is

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,430
really done this part is really done

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,460
okay for managed hosting no you got to

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,460
run this part a bit more which is fine

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,530
if your developers okay this is fine all

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,549
right but if you are Lee people we are

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,309
business guys and

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:33,799
what to do this sort of stuff there okay

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:36,529
not so fine right yeah so this is all

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,940
vanilla I wouldn't really go too much

00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,200
into that Lee's already for striving

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,340
paper everybody's familiar with that

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,429
okay so it's going to go through

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,230
everything and se weapons here I

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:52,820
installed jet pack please don't do that

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:56,720
Jeff I was so down outside okay yeah

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,549
really heat jet pack there we go okay

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,159
and I'm really selling after five

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,830
minutes alright add a new product so

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:08,600
everything's pretty much the same all

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:11,179
right and then done okay yeah again

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,769
nasty fires also built for agencies so

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,850
if you're my agency this is great

00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:18,320
and see if I really helps you out with

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,840
that alright so comparison chart

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,720
comparison a glance while stuff that you

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,909
card has repressors painting has nests

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:32,299
if I has so instant store to be fair

00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:34,340
wordpress.com doesn't really have

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:38,419
instance store you still need to click

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,429
on the install plug-in button but they

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:42,049
have the plan I assume that if you

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,330
activate the plan it's going to be

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,879
install for you I did not try because I

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:51,259
cannot afford 400 bucks

00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:56,769
yes at the point I'm yeah info right

00:21:51,259 --> 00:22:00,019
okay no free travel no filter okay

00:21:56,769 --> 00:22:02,899
Pantheon you still need to click install

00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,609
for your homers next if I just now as

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,869
you can see can just select you commerce

00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,369
before and and everything since stuff

00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:09,200
for you okay

00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,999
for the sauce obviously there's no JIT

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,369
obviously you don't have access to a

00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:15,379
database because it's us it's just like

00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,090
your Shopify site you don't have access

00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,470
to JIT you don't have access to a

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,220
database there's no way there you can

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,710
touch a code

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,759
alright there's no local environments no

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:28,580
ok but this is perfect for people who

00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,169
just want to get started into e-commerce

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,249
and don't want to in Shopify

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:36,769
what's the one to have freedom of the

00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:39,410
edita and of the code so you can anytime

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:43,520
export this out and suffice it yourself

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:45,290
she's great all right now the one thing

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,960
about what I really like is that they

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,710
actually have a deaf environment which

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,960
most sauce platformers don't have

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:59,060
Shopify has it only if you're an agency

00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:02,870
not if yourself you know start customer

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,760
or Shopify all right Luca actually has a

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,620
choices of server location I didn't

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,910
actually go through that earlier okay so

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,590
you can actually choose where you want

00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:14,600
to locate your your site we can allows

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,160
you to install custom plugins WordPress

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,810
doesn't really allow you to install

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,550
custom plugins it's only whatever is on

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,940
the repository so you can't really add

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:25,970
or import your own plugins all right

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,040
unless of course you have with VIP then

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,870
there's a different story altogether

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,400
custom themes same thing and whether the

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,410
one thing that is different that

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,350
WordPress does button every one is of

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:39,620
course space there's unlimited space

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,540
okay but in terms of user friendliness I

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,610
don't think that wordpress.com is is

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,030
friendly even if they're nice Jewish

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:50,510
clean interface the rest have their own

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:53,090
very neat dashboards right the price

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:59,950
will cut Wow you know five bucks per

00:23:53,090 --> 00:24:02,780
month okay thanks and you can see how

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,360
that's like for the others okay

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,400
poor time which ecommerce platform do

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:16,130
you use quick quick quick I got five

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:20,720
minutes will come a Shopify at this we

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:27,700
need to polish good any data any details

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,700
come on what come on

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,570
is it moving sometimes I don't know

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:42,780
where the slider works you know it's

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:46,559
like this elect or something let me just

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,559
see what it it looks again

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,930
and she give it a minute then she just

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:10,180
probably by then there will be this test

00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:23,940
coming up no loading if I mixed up my

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:26,980
slide okay who comments by others okay

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:34,840
start loading up inside oh come on

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:39,100
oh yeah okay and just comparing size

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,800
here okay so just at Shopify into the

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:46,600
mix alright instance store everything

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,310
have a set for loose for things okay so

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,620
we can see the price differences it's

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,930
really a lot now been my again repress

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,500
calm you have to pay annually which is

00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,240
very painful

00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:00,180
alright for who cut no everything's

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,180
monthly Shopify everything smoothly okay

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,270
oh yeah we should call massage but

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:16,650
family thing is better I hope this time

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:19,280
it works is it the same question it's a

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,280
different question right

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:48,539
so slow to load again you should have a

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:54,019
green bar it's not loading up for some

00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:59,490
reason yeah so you know okay

00:26:54,019 --> 00:27:03,360
the pool is still active I think no

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:06,059
active post at the moment a strange so

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,549
we maintain answer okay nevermind I'm

00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,549
gonna assume everybody sees new comers

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,590
so this is what the stats really say

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,549
this is coming from the horse's mouth

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,159
themself

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,750
back in 2017 this was three million now

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,159
is five million okay

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,409
a lot people attend tell me you're gonna

00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,299
eat your own shots okay you know what

00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,279
comas is better than Shopify just look

00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,019
at this test that's all you need to see

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,760
right okay

00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:35,510
five million yeah just look at its test

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,919
now Lois any siliceous as of august 1919

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,440
take a look at the wordpress plugin not

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,320
a contradiction match all right

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,899
according to the Shopify investor report

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,330
in quarter for 2018 there were eight

00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:51,690
hundred thousand active Shopify sites

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,630
back in pt-17 that was half a million so

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,940
on another 20,000 now these are all nice

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,519
and everything but as we all know Marty

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,700
needs to see there are three types of

00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,289
lies lies damned lies and statistics

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,539
okay none of them are actually telling

00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:12,570
the truth because if you look at that

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:15,120
party data this is from book with top 1

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,210
million sites WooCommerce 25% choppy 5

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,789
20 % over the top 1 million sites top

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,250
10,000 sites Shopify it's a bit more I

00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:25,409
see a lot more at 50% will Commerce

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,350
about 4 percent and a top 10,000 sites

00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:30,450
all right so I'm not gonna eat my shots

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:34,580
in Singapore it's pretty even Stephen

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:40,470
Shopify 25% and will come as at maybe 3%

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:42,630
alright so time for Q and E obviously

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:47,000
side was not working at the moment right

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,490
so just shout out your answers ok

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,530
question time

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:56,400
yes ask my own professional opinion to

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:59,220
be fair a hitchhike shop if I also hit

00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,720
shop if I also I just hit all comers

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,060
more okay so I'm agnostic I don't really

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,450
care so long as it benefits the customer

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,490
again most customers are not back they

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,420
don't understand it so they just want to

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,930
use whatever works right my personal

00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,210
preference is easy we easy we person

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:41,300
preference okay anybody else any other

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:48,810
questions yes thank you yeah yes

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:52,500
instance I yeah so my definition for it

00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,340
is in terms of woop homicide not a

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,310
wordpress site

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,990
so for pentane you still need to go to

00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,600
the plug-in repository and click on

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,860
install WooCommerce for Nesta fire you

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,360
don't need to do that you can just

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,600
select move Commons from the beginning

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,450
of our dashboard and when it finishes

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:14,220
loading up look on this ready install

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:18,510
yeah any questions how many how many

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,080
more time go ahead I'm done I'll take

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,080
two more

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,060
this one okay

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:49,250
yes yes papa Vita sanim I know my king

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:51,169
is up so yeah so who commands is great

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,299
for some things not great for at this

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:56,240
this is great for as developers era is

00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:59,450
great for customization it's free as in

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,769
free speech okay so if you want endless

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:06,100
customizations yes new comers okay

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:10,100
amongst all the e-commerce platforms

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,809
WooCommerce Magento and what's the other

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,240
one people like to talk about I don't

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:15,950
know sorry

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,720
Joomla say something like that all right

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,789
I can feel that WooCommerce is still

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,750
better than Magento because there's less

00:31:19,789 --> 00:32:14,899
tables Magento tools to install 200 plus

00:31:23,750 --> 00:32:16,700
tables right so it's very ok so yeah so

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:20,440
one thing that Shopify is very good at

00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,880
is actually it was really built for

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,970
medium-size retailers from the beginning

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,610
and it allows you to scale fast because

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,019
on on a cloud right a very slow commerce

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,279
most most of you commerce in stores are

00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:36,529
self hosted right I they're not really

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,529
on WordPress VIP or they're not really

00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:42,200
on AWS so normally there on your share

00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:44,330
hosting service alright so for Shopify

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,429
one thing good about that is that you

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,770
know you can still people thinking too

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,960
much and everything is done by them it's

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,360
not done by your developers ok so the

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,620
perception is good only because they did

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,860
they care law things on the back it's

00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,850
like VIP but you know for smaller size

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,740
guys but you have to bear in mind that

00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,630
the a lot of things that you want

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,850
there's a price to it that's a very

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,010
heavy price to it so the cheapest ones

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,799
are $39 a month but some things like

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,830
automatic th shipping is coming in a

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,919
price of $299 month that's even more

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,889
expensive then your own wordpress.com

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:26,120
yeah

00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:28,779
any other questions what yes I'll take

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,779
this one more

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,140
hi hi

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:48,710
you enjoy to eat office hours I would

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,530
almost and our friends are only for

00:33:48,710 --> 00:34:00,260
small to medium business not for last

00:33:51,530 --> 00:34:03,830
wishes why is it perception no it's not

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:06,559
it's not okay one concern is actually

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:09,889
the way that the table structure is

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,230
organized I think it might have change

00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,879
recently to be very few and to be frank

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,710
if you have no comments about two years

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,080
so I can really see of the Lita's

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,840
changes okay

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,240
but back in 2017 at least the table

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,330
structure was very bad so the paths

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,889
about the variance are tough to work

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,109
with but not Shopify's a lot easier

00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,740
because it was already directed at

00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:37,040
retail e-commerce so it's great for five

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:41,990
thousand excuse and below well that you

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,190
might see your site slow down yeah in in

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,720
that case Magento would be better

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,369
because they are configured for more

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:54,109
than fighters excuse that's why they

00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:56,330
have more than three tables yeah table

00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:58,880
structure basically because this you

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:04,430
know weird things going back in the

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,500
comics tables basically yeah okay all

00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,930
right so this one more slide actually so

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,890
this is helping out the friends over

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,810
