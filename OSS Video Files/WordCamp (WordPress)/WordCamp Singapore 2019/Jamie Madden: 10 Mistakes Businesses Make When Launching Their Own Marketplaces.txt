thank you hi everyone good day so far

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,780
all right oh that's me I've been in

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,920
WordPress world since before WordPress

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,710
being in IT world for more than yeah all

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,220
my entire adult life and the rest of it

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,880
you've already heard about so what is w

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,880
see vendors

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,850
it is a multi-vendor marketplace plugin

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,440
for WordPress and WooCommerce that

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,960
allows you to turn a standard

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,329
WooCommerce installation into a multi

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,450
seller platform like eBay Amazon Etsy

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,420
any of those we have 10,000 plus active

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,340
installs we've been around five ish

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,530
October it's five years and we're just

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,969
about to hit 500,000 downloads for the

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,190
free product we have free n Pro versions

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,530
our PV is the parent company we focus

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,420
mostly in bidding WordPress and we

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,479
comment stuff but we've also just got

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,420
into building solutions for learn -

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,630
which is I think the best elearning

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,650
platform for WordPress at the moment

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,470
we're a hundred percent remote team

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,549
we're based in Vietnam South Africa the

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:25,770
Philippines and soon India if you want

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,689
to come work for us come you later so a

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,060
little bit more detail what is a

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,790
multi-vendor marketplace you build a

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,820
platform and you allow people to sign up

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,340
and sell products on the platform and

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,450
you have a way that you charge them for

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,960
them you can either charge them a

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,119
listing fee a subscription or a

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,430
commission and those Commission's can be

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,820
anything from percentage fixed fee

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,640
tiered there is a various number of ways

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,380
to do commissions and the biggest part

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,299
is allowing the vendors to actually self

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,729
manage their products and their orders

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,590
so you don't have to do that as the

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,860
marketplace owner yourself you should be

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,439
more engaged in creating an experience

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,489
for the customers and the vendors not

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,810
the day-to-day order management the best

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,890
thing you get to do is you can create

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,780
your own niche

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,010
Amazon Etsy eBay whatever it is so

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,110
there's three different areas I'll be

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,590
talking about today that people make

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,980
mistakes when they build marketplaces

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,350
the the plug-in or the platform is only

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,180
just a third of it you've also got all

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:39,930
the business and after launch operations

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:43,250
so firstly in business people never have

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,390
a plan they just start their business

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,130
business and off they go they think that

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,500
they can have very simple commission

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,270
rates and they completely forget about

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,910
all the business requirements and legal

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,340
requirements required to actually start

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,870
a business in their jurisdiction so I'll

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,390
go through these different areas plans

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,550
actually define what you want know what

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,709
you're going to do before you build it

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,340
if you can't define what your business

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:17,970
is you've already failed you need to

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,980
know who your target market is who's

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,700
going to look after it when it's built

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,400
who's going to build it how long do you

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,900
think it's going to take to find your

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,360
commission rates and the biggest one

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,519
that I don't see anyone doing and I

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,769
myself included in some of my first

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,200
businesses is doing financial

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,930
projections and financial projections

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,489
help you know if your business is

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,470
actually viable so if you don't if you

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,720
can't see your earnings and you can't

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,260
see profitability in the product then

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,519
there's probably no point in building it

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,430
and something that we see a lot is

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,690
people come to us and ask for discounts

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,730
severe discounts because I can't afford

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,250
the plot the plug-in if you can't afford

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,959
$200 a year for your business then you

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,630
probably shouldn't be building the

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,720
business so there's a lot of a lot of

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,430
issues where people will they think they

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,970
can just install the plug-in hit send

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,519
and and business is done I'm gonna be a

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,250
millionaire next week know that that

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,200
doesn't look like that ever the build it

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,880
and they will come attitude of internet

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,280
businesses just doesn't work anymore as

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,510
we've seen in two other talks today SEO

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,180
and marketing plans

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,340
are very important almost as important

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,220
or more important than the product

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,080
itself because if people come on your

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,220
marketplace

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,870
vendors can't find your marketplace to

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,180
sell on it it's just gonna be a

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,710
wasteland of nothingness

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,600
you need to have onboarding systems for

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,790
your vendors and for your customers so

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
many people forget about their vendors

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,300
they think that cost because the

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,990
customers can buy a product that's

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,780
enough

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,350
they don't have decent signup systems

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,150
they don't have concierge systems to

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,980
make it easy for the vendors to actually

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,410
get on board they don't even have help

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,820
systems so they just assume that the

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,400
vendors will work out how to publish a

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,350
product they assume that the customers

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
will know how to purchase something how

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,270
to do request the refund

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,460
how to ask a pre-sales question just

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,610
because you think it's easy doesn't mean

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,110
it's easy so these are things in terms

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,940
of the business side of things that you

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,530
need to think about before you even get

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,370
started writing a lot of code or

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,820
installing a plug-in or buying a plugin

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,950
commission rates I've logged into

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,040
thousands of sites where the Commission

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,070
rate is 5% so they're taking 5% of a

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,140
sale three point six of that is taken in

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,510
transaction fees so they're making less

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,730
than 2% on every sale that's not

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,400
sustainable when you're in a niche

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,830
market place you should be charging much

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,990
higher chunks of commission if it's a

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,440
percentage based Commission so you

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,180
should be looking at a minimum of 30%

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,880
especially when you first start as you

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,500
get larger and larger you can adjust

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,020
your commission rates you can use

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,820
different things where you can use its

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,430
membership system where you can say a

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,350
bronze membership you can publish 50

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,230
products but your commission rate is 80%

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,980
but if you painting $100 a month then

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,740
I'll only take 20% so you can you can

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,350
get recurring revenue before you even

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,810
sell a single product by selling

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:31,140
memberships to the vendors instead and

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,550
the other option is you can do reward

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,890
your top sellers so if you look at any

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,770
of the marketplaces like Envato

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,090
or any stock marketplace the more you

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,240
sell the more money you make

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,990
so you do Commission Commission systems

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:51,040
so if you're up to 5,000 in sales

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:57,430
it's a 70/30 split but if you do 15,000

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:59,590
and sales then it's 80 15 75 or 15 85 or

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,050
whatever it is so the marketplace earns

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,750
less because the that vendor has already

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,240
earned their place on the marketplace so

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,690
you see the top sellers get extra

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,820
promotions on the enviro products where

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,200
that you always see the the guys that is

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,729
like these guys are made a million

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,320
dollars on Envato and you're like well

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,729
that's a lot of money but you need to

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,080
realize that it took them maybe three

00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,080
years to get to that but they were

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,900
rewarded every step of the way and so

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,520
many businesses don't reward their

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,460
vendors when they build their

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,800
marketplaces all the legal requirements

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,979
do you need a business license so many

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,229
people build these systems and then they

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,400
go to sign up for their bank accounts

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,660
and stuff like that or they don't at all

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
they just put it into their personal

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,570
account bad idea do you need business

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,010
insurance in a lot of countries you

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,590
actually need business insurance even

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,130
for internet businesses so you need to

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,050
look that up

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,520
Australia is a good example of that

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,630
where you need to have a billion

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,580
different insurances to do anything get

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,220
all your policies in place your privacy

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:11,020
policy your user policies your vendor

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,850
agreements so these are things that most

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,130
websites should have even for just a

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,840
standard WooCommerce shop not just

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,020
marketplaces but just any online

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,940
business have you support policies in

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,990
price so you know you can tell the

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,820
customer what support is covered so you

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,770
need to work that out and those these

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,110
policies will change over time as your

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,099
business grows or the direction of the

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,560
business changes

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,719
what are your refund policies is that a

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,440
flat blanket 14-day refund no questions

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,029
asked

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,890
or is it have they downloaded the

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,430
product there needs to be a fault with

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,110
it have you returned the product how are

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,420
you gonna do RMA's what are your

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,630
copyright notices do you have any DMCA

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,920
requirements that's more of a u.s. thing

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,160
and then your jurisdictional

00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,610
like in the EU they have some very

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,410
interesting tax requirements for anyone

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,089
that does business in the EU including

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,089
people that don't live in the EU so

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,350
where as a business in the in the US or

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,240
Australia or even Singapore if you're

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,949
selling to EU customers you're supposed

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,670
to actually be collecting taxes and

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:18,010
sending that to the EU but it's not

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,959
viable for most businesses to do that so

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,699
they just ignore it but if you get big

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,790
enough the EU will come after you

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:27,790
in taxes get your taxes in orders from

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,470
day one so work out if your vendors are

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,170
taking on the tax burden or whether

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,930
you're taking on the tax burden so some

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,089
jurisdictions commissions are actually

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,449
taxed so you need to think about that as

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,100
well so taxes is a nightmare and you

00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:46,329
should talk to your accountant before

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:51,160
you get started because taxes can break

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:54,250
a business very quickly platform

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,029
concerns so these are building the

00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,600
actual product so what features are you

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,529
going to have what are your expectations

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,540
what solutions you're going to do and

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,430
how you're gonna pay your vendors and in

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,060
all of these areas I've seen the same

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,459
mistakes over and over again

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,930
first one is everyone tries to make

00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,640
every feature they could possibly

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,350
install in there and you log into the

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,660
site and they've got 84 plugins active

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,529
and you're like what what are you doing

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,300
this it's like oh well I need to I need

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,820
to have every feature that Amazon has

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,230
which is comes down to the expectations

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,360
don't try and compete with Amazon

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,160
there's no point there a bajillion

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,120
dollar marketplace you should be

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,290
competing against yourself first

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,410
when you first look launch your

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,850
marketplace what is the minimum amount

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:48,190
of features that you can provide to

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:52,209
build that marketplace and do nothing

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,149
else then once you've got that worked

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,250
out have all the data and analytics in

00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,490
place so you can collect and work out

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,790
what features you should be adding after

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,620
launch so listen to your data and even

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,540
listen to your vendors the vendors will

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,870
start to ask questions about all.we it's

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,300
really

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,779
difficult to do this or its we don't use

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,250
this feature at all why is it active we

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,310
really need this new way to communicate

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:23,370
with our customers because we're not

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:25,690
we're missing out on pre-sales as I said

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,970
don't try and compete with all the big

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,390
market places find your niche which is

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,400
something that another talk spoke about

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,410
earlier today is find a niche and just

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,770
drill down into it and just saturate

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,750
your niche buy yourself some of the most

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,050
successful marketplaces I've seen have

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:48,490
just done one thing so one is all they

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:50,080
do is they sell fantasy book covers so

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,180
if you're a fantasy writer you go to

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,510
this marketplace and you can buy a book

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,150
cover

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:58,110
that's all they sell is digital book

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,000
covers and then you've got just

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,740
secondhand books so as soon as I see

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,279
someone that comes in and say hey I want

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,130
options

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,870
I need bookings I need digital downloads

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,350
I need shipping to 15 countries

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,839
I need multi currency the first thing I

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,820
say is you've got too many features just

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,770
do one thing and do it well if you want

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,730
to do options do options if you want to

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,589
do service bookings

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,390
do service bookings if you want to do

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,820
digital download products do only

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,890
digital download products don't do all

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,080
of them like there are certain areas

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,520
where digital and physical makes sense

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,410
where you're you might be selling an

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,890
online course and it comes with physical

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,450
learning materials that makes sense or

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,880
cooking class this is another example

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,190
where the cooking classes online and

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,750
it's scheduled but they actually send

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,940
out a box with all the ingredients to

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,020
the students that makes sense to have

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,750
physical and digital but just stick into

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,120
one area and make it work because if you

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,750
try and do too much you won't do

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,750
anything at all

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,410
your payments and payouts time and time

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,630
again I've had people contacting me or

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,980
we need to launch in a week and I and I

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,470
don't know which payment gateway to use

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,740
it's like you should have picked the

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,630
payment gateway three months ago so so

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,040
many people will come to us they'll

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,810
build a complete solution and then

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,140
realize that stripe or PayPal doesn't

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,190
work in their country which of the two

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,330
are the biggest in the world and

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,010
something they probably should have

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,600
figured out a long time ago there are

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,680
hundreds and hundreds of payment

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,990
gateways available for we're commerce

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,940
but they just don't look it up so know

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,660
how you're going to take payments from

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,970
your customers work out what your refund

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,860
policy is for those payments what are

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,810
the transaction fees are you passing

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,580
those transaction fees on to your

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,710
vendors or are you taking the

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,540
transaction fee that needs to be worked

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,000
out because a lot of people when they do

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,070
their 10% or 5% Commission and then they

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,170
do their there the numbers is okay I

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,170
mean I made 92 cents on that sale that

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,430
that doesn't seem like much how am I

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,010
gonna make any money on this it doesn't

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,600
seem sustainable it's cuz it's not you

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,470
need to think about all those things and

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,420
that's where the financial projections

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,890
come in at the beginning when you're

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,690
doing your financial projections you

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,580
need to include your taxes you need to

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,560
include the transaction fees you need to

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,270
include your hosting fees you need to

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,640
include your recurring plug-in fees

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,410
developer costs there's all of these

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,000
things about operating your business

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,400
that everyone forgets about and just

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,339
assumes that'll all just come out in the

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,300
wash it doesn't the other one is how

00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,700
you're going to pay your vendors

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,050
depending on which product you use will

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,010
depend on how you're going to pay your

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,770
vendors out so most almost all big

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,959
marketplaces payout on a schedule the

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,810
reason why they do that is commission

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,750
payouts take time to do the reports it's

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,670
an accounting action that is done by

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,339
your accounting team that might be you

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,410
it might be your actual accountant but

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,529
someone has to sit down and work that

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,959
all out and that needs to also come into

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:06,630
account with your refund program so if

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:09,000
you've got refunds you need to have a

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,400
way to ensure that the refunds are

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,060
actually taken to account before you pay

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,680
out your commission

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,780
because if you pay out a commission and

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,330
then a customer wants a refund you have

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,130
to pay the refund out of your half until

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,380
you can then get it back from the vendor

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,300
so how do you handle that so you put it

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,970
on our weekly schedule daily schedule

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,280
monthly schedule to all the big places

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,100
usually put on schedule and they have a

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,140
minimum payout and that's usually so

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,340
they can cover a refund that's the main

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,270
reason why they'll have it on a schedule

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,070
or if you're in specific industries you

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,690
may not be able to actually pay your

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,430
vendors through anything other than a

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,670
manual payment system so that could be a

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,470
bank transfer it could be a cheque

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,660
cryptocurrency bottlecaps whatever it is

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,910
you may end up paying in a manual system

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,180
so depending on what products and

00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,360
services your marketplace provides we'll

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:05,420
determine what you're paying out when

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,420
you're paying it out and how often

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,440
now you're operating concerns you've

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,680
managed to get your business plan

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,120
written you've managed to work out you

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,740
only need six features so you're only

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,450
going to need 24 plugins instead of 80

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,820
you've worked out what your commission

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,640
rates will be you've worked out

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,400
everything you've got it already all

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,290
right it's launched so who's going to

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,880
look after it are you going to be doing

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,670
the monthly updates have you actually

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,490
been smart enough to get serviced

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,890
hosting from WordPress kenster WP engine

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,650
site grounds managed services Bluehost

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,930
many services have you paid someone else

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,880
so it's their problem to look after your

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,080
day-to-day maintenance or is that

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,970
something you're going to take the

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,860
burden on for yourself do you have

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,400
someone technical in your founding team

00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,180
if you don't and you need customization

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,580
who will you go to for that refund

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,430
management again your support systems

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,570
and that's for both customers and the

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:12,210
vendors you need to test your plugins

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:15,540
all the time you need to test your

00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:17,130
themes all the time that's just part and

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,940
parcel of being in the WordPress

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,150
ecosystem

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:24,720
updates are regular security holes are

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,400
found all the time so be subscribed to

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,380
the vulnerability

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
a basis so you know if any of the

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,210
plugins that you're using have a

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,310
security hole in them get staging

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,460
servers don't run live updates on your

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,250
sites ever I have so many people come to

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,380
us and say a plug-in may be ours or

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,150
someone else's has bricked their site so

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,970
they can't take any orders you should be

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,880
testing every single update on a staging

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,670
environment first that way if you find a

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,310
problem you can report it while your

00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:01,320
business is still operating otherwise

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:05,220
you're gonna have problems ask your

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,700
users send out surveys your customers

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,190
your vendors if you see if you've got a

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,320
heatmap system in your environment and

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,010
you see that one feature is never ever

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,160
used start to a/b testing to disable and

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:24,540
see if anyone notices ask your vendors

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:29,250
what feature are they gonna want what's

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:31,920
going to help them out later on refunds

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,660
and support what is your policy is the

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,000
platform gonna take on the burden or is

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,670
the vendor how are they going to be

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,270
contacted is that through a chat system

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:44,250
so through a support ticket you customer

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,010
support and vendor support most of these

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,550
are much the same don't don't do email

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:53,430
don't do email support it as in and by

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,990
that I mean support at something and it

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,210
goes into a gmail inbox and you're just

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,690
reading a Gmail inbox you can still do

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,670
email based ticket support but have it

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:08,120
going into a ticket system such as

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:10,020
Zendesk or freshdesk helpdesk help scout

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,790
awesome support is actually a really

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,360
good one if you have a medium-sized

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:17,280
store which is a built in - it's a

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,290
wordpress plugin you can use support

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,790
forums in some instances but as your

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,240
volume gets bigger it gets more

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,060
difficult to moderate your forums and if

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,240
you're using any of the wordpress based

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,270
forums notifications just break BB press

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,590
where are you

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,050
that's the reason why we went to ticket

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,240
based support we would just not get

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,060
notifications for things and anyone who

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,410
has a plug-in

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,760
on wordpress.org it's it's difficult to

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,710
keep up with that so we've actually got

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,560
a slack bot now that just every that

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:54,100
hooks into the RSS post to notify us of

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,020
a problem offer any new posts but even

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,050
then the slack bot will notify some days

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,060
later of a post so we'll get in there

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,710
and then there's like new posts and it's

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,510
like posted three days ago I was like

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,640
but I was on there three days ago this

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,610
wasn't there like what's going on so

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,260
ticket based support for everyone the

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,630
great thing about help Scout on even

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,920
their basic one you get five mailboxes

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,010
you can use so you could have one for

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:22,210
your vendors one for customers one for

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:25,960
refunds and you've got to spare help

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,050
scout scout as in SCO

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,310
yep vendor support how your vendors

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,720
going to contact you when the vendors

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,040
have a problem are they going to be

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,070
emailing you every hour of every day

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,530
create guides for your vendors on your

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,450
theme so a lot of a lot of the wordpress

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,890
plugins for marketplaces create

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,020
documentation for vendors and things

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,720
like that but it's a generic view it

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,820
doesn't have your marketplaces theme it

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,040
doesn't have your color scheme so that

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,410
can be confusing for new vendors you

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,120
can't assume your vendors tech savvy

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,410
they just want to sell some stuff on

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,400
your site the whole reason they're

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,990
selling on your site is because they

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,080
didn't want to build their own so create

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:11,230
helpful videos create hell two guides

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,910
have a seller forum so have a private

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,520
forum for your sellers to help each

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,260
other so part of what you want to do is

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,810
you want to create as much self service

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,650
support as possible to reduce your

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:27,510
tickets it'll make it easier for you to

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,510
do and run your business

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:37,540
so in conclusion what do you need for a

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,299
marketplace a plans a good start have a

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:44,470
platform you can use WordPress with

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:46,600
commerce WC vendors you could use one of

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,540
the hosted marketplace solutions don't

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,830
do it

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,320
what are your products and services how

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,490
are you going to what what are you

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,270
selling on there or what do you want

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,549
people to sell who are you vendors who

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:04,030
your customers make sure you've got good

00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:06,309
tools for your vendors great customer

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,850
support systems and lots of

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,370
documentation send out regular

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,250
newsletters so people know that there's

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:19,780
new products that there's new features

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:21,790
and have a blog so people can come to

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,040
you for content marketing purposes so

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,330
you're not just a sales platform you're

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,250
also creating an environment where

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,690
people coming to your marketplace for

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:39,480
useful information that's basically all

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:39,480
of it is something that we're launching

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:47,860
soon it's going to be a new marketplace

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,830
for plugins and themes so this is going

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,230
to be a dedicated curated plug-in and

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,900
themed marketplace for developers were

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,750
including a license and update server

00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,890
all of the releases will be get based

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,450
we're going to have a pre sales and

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,780
support ticket sale system built into

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:07,270
the marketplace for the vendors all of

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,340
our code will be passing through human

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,070
code auditors as well as computer code

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,799
auditors we're going to be setting

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,120
minimum price recommendations so we're

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,770
not going to be doing race to the bottom

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,100
pricing like a lot of other marketplaces

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:23,110
do and we're going to create an FAQ and

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,540
dock system for every product so we're

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,910
going to create an environment where as

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,590
a customer when you buy the product

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,160
you're not going to four websites to get

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,320
information it's all centralized you get

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,429
a year of support and updates you get

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,490
ticket based support you get an easy use

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,129
presale system

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,090
and some regular tips and tricks to help

00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,090
you get a long way

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,880
questions

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:11,429
it's not about EU citizenship it's about

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:14,690
selling to EU citizens correct

00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:18,410
nobody does though but we're supposed to

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,410
[Laughter]

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:30,070
correct so no you have to pay it's like

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,140
Australia has started in enforcing if

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,940
you're an Australian GST registered

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,850
business and you're selling to the EU

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:42,220
you have to collect EU taxes and remit

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:43,870
that to the EU yeah it's it's gonna it's

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,590
gonna start getting that's what they're

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,780
supposed to every business since the EU

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,760
tax system came in is supposed to be

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,300
collecting taxes on behalf of the EU no

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,150
matter where your business is based but

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,830
yeah you're supposed to but they don't

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,390
so if you get big enough though the EU

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:05,830
will come and ask you for that for them

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:07,929
to start removing taxes google it it's

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,460
it's not fun when you you you start

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:12,420
realizing saying hey that's that's not

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,420
very fun

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:23,790
I mentioned my ex like anyone else

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,790
Bueller Bueller

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:41,059
it's the same thing let's say for

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:47,960
example well correct so that's why no

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:49,309
one actually does it yeah so if your

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,830
business gets big enough you usually

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,390
create a subsidiary within the EU to

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,360
just send all the payments through the

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,520
EU and then it just gets handled so

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,890
you'll see on some marketplaces now if

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,529
you're an EU citizen it'll kick you off

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,080
to an EU version of the site so it'll be

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:09,649
an EU payment system the taxes will be

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,360
adjusted for your location so the taxes

00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:13,309
we're in the process of writing a tax

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,270
plugin at the moment and taxes are

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:20,360
painful in every jurisdiction if you

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,909
look at for instance in New York State

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,510
in the United States they have twenty

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:29,870
one hundred and seventy six tax rules

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:31,970
for one state in America and it's all

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,130
based on what you're selling so you need

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:37,220
to select what the product is and then

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:39,110
that will change what the tax rate is

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,820
and then the tax rate is different

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,250
depending on where the seller and the

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,260
buyer are and then you need to collect

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,649
all that and report it to the state in

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,980
federal tax authorities their hurts your

00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:55,370
brain a lot so if you can for taxes for

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,110
any e-commerce look at tax jar or other

00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,820
services like that where they handle all

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,250
of that and they're great there's great

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,950
plugins for for WooCommerce and EDD and

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,919
those where you can just get tax jar to

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,710
calculate your US taxes or your EU taxes

00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,789
so if you're an EU based business use

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,529
tax jar or Avalara or one of the other

00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:17,809
tax rates com where they'll actually

00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:19,880
they'll handle all the taxes for you and

makes it much easier for taxes

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,809
I had too much coffee Arthur question

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,610
that business perspective are harvesting

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:46,159
avoid the model they proposed is not

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:47,659
popular libraries are in Vietnam in

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,070
terms of my business or in terms of

00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:53,779
running a marketplace so the

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,549
sustainability of these kinds of things

00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:59,360
it's kind of a chicken and egg problem

00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,360
where you need to have sellers but you

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,679
also need customers so what I do is I

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,080
find sellers first and the reason is is

00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,730
because they've got nothing to lose

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,649

00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:18,980
penalties so you can sell on as many

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,659
marketplaces as you want so there's

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,270
