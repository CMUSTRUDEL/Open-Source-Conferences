Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Singapore 2019
Description: 
	The freelance work/life balance is a bit challenging to get right. Having the freedom to work at home (or anywhere) is a major perk for freelancers. But because you’re the boss, you’re always driven to check your emails even on weekends or work until late at night to crunch numbers and keep the money rolling in. Work can become an overwhelming presence in your personal life and you suddenly feel like you’re always “working”.
There are strategies you can employ to avoid business burnout and create work/life balance, which includes setting boundaries between work and personal life, creating processes and delegating work.
In this talk, you will learn different ways on how to manage a healthy work/life balance and relieve the stress of self-employment while ensuring a recurring income.

thank you honey I'm just gonna get stuck

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,490
right in but I'll get everyone to stand

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,300
up first we're all feeling that after

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,250
lunch slump yeah so I'm gonna ask a

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,580
couple of questions and you can sit down

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:23,119
if it's a yes so do you work more than

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:30,449
50 hours a week do you work more than 40

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:33,719
how about 20 so does anyone work more

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,360
than 15 hours a week and okay so I'm the

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,670
only one left standing my work hours of

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,440
this right now under 15 hours a week

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,329
and I'm still bringing in the same

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,510
income I was before I took maternity

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,850
leave it took me a year to get to this

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,500
place where I could take six months off

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,860
and only check in on my business a

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,590
couple of times a week I head down

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,070
getting everything ready but once it was

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,199
up and running and I took that leave

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,820
I've come back and I haven't had to work

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,320
as hard as I did before which has been

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,880
really amazing so yeah I guess one of

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,180
the biggest things that prompted me to

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,610
do it falling pregnant but also the fact

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,400
that I've suffered burnout before so I

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,020
was in a corporate environment working

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,229
over 50 hours a week on the getting paid

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,439
for 40 of those expected to stay late

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,869
coming early and and make someone else a

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,119
lot of money so that's where I sort of

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,439
started to go well why am I doing this

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,119
to someone else when I can do it for

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,930
myself on my own terms and make it work

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,590
for myself and my family so has anyone

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,060
else here suffered from burnout so you

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,740
feel like you're stuck in a funk you've

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,180
got no motivation

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,130
the thought of picking up your laptop

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,170
and starting to do some work is actually

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,890
quite depressing rather than enjoying

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,290
what you do

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,380
so hopefully the tips I share today can

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,820
help you avoid it wheezes so Who am I

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,979
I'm Hayley I'm from the Gold Coast in

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,750
Australia my husband is Matt and I'm a

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,899
new mum to Mason he's only ten months

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,989
old and yes he's at home in Australia so

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,540
five days away we've got two dogs and a

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,660
cat and I actually leave to travel so

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,810
that's another reason for start

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,200
my own business in this industry what do

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,270
I do

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,040
as Alana said I'm the owner and creative

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,570
director at brand check a web design

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,430
studio with clients in Sydney and

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,310
Melbourne and we do some work for a

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,440
business in Singapore I've got a keen

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,980
interest in user experience design and

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,420
but my day-to-day involves involved

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,670
hands-on web design and project

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,570
management so I've now just scaled back

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,020
to project management and why listen to

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,670
me

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,530
so I've touched on this already so I

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,620
work on an average 5 hours a day 3 days

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,660
a week I take days off on those days as

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,610
and when needed and I work from anywhere

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,360
I choose

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,610
so that's Mason one of the reasons I do

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,300
what I do now this is Mason in Bali

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,120
where we spent a month in April and that

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,690
was my office the other day so big

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,170
reasons why I do what I do and how I how

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,940
I've made it work for me so before we

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,530
dive too deep into the five steps I want

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,410
to I want you to think about why you do

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,790
what you do so some of the the reasons

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,490
in this industry come to mind are

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:25,180
freedom working from home travel family

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,770
money for me initially it was always

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,140
about the travel and it will continue to

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,000
be I could work from anywhere I could

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,700
get a connection whether it be Peru

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,620
Lombok la don't try and work from Cuba

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,240
because it won't happen but now that

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,590
family is a new element and flexible

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,080
hours working from home has become a

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:49,690
real priority sorry why is your Y

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,430
important so how many times have you not

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,410
been able to relate to your client their

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,120
business or their goals have you noticed

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,230
that it's these projects that tend to be

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,010
the ones that become harder than

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,320
expected so always remember your Y sorry

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm reading I should have reread this

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:10,780
again and if your Y doesn't align with a

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,420
project digit I have permission to share

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,290
a colleagues story so the last year she

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,359
went through a bit of a transition

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,150
herself and she really looked at the

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,870
jobs she enjoyed doing and it came down

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,600
to

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,280
she split off into two separate and

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,200
yuneisia so the main and the most

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,950
obvious was being for her was working

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,590
with charity

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,240
nonprofits and startups and the second

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,550
and what I think is the most exciting is

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,680
her passion to mentor and coach graphic

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,900
designers and teach them how to be web

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,400
designers she loves sharing her

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,840
knowledge and seeing other succeed so

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,410
she's turned that into a successful

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,130
business model so what are the five

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,170
steps so before I start I want to point

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,270
out that this is a really basic overview

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,640
each one of these steps could be a whole

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,780
presentation in its own and if you want

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,870
to chat about any of them in more detail

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,670
feel free I'm around tonight tomorrow so

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,270
more than happy to chat to everyone and

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,870
it's something that I'm really

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,580
passionate about so please let's chat

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,030
all right so what are the five steps so

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,820
documenting processes implementing

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,780
recurring revenue streams increasing

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,140
your rates hiring staff and setting

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,140
boundaries

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,520
give everyone a tips to take a photo so

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,710
let's start with documenting processes

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,840
it's really important

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:45,440
sorry I'm sorry oh I went really far

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,440
back sorry I tried to be fancy

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,440
all right so documenting processes it's

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,720
really important for a number of reasons

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,840
biggest ones are hiring staff and the

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,370
sale ability of your business without

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:13,700
documented processes you really have no

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:15,950
business okay so make the time I don't

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,930
have time you say set aside a window

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,070
every week for business development you

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,310
were here at WordCamp because you

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,870
genuinely care about what you do when I

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,880
started my business and obviously I was

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,040
really really quiet I set aside every

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,640
Wednesday each week to work on business

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,320
development now not even now but last

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,640
year it was down to a couple of hours

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:39,410
before I ramped it up before I went on

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,270
life okay so be detailed every task you

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,170
do can be doc you documented down to the

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,060
finest of details so things to include a

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,800
purpose of the process why it's

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,740
important what you need before doing it

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,750
so the tools the content logins etc the

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:59,570
actual steps to do it so the actual

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,820
process of how it gets done what done

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,520
looks like so an example of the actual

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,680
outcome a checklist to complete comfort

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
confirmed completion and what to do if

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,770
you have a problem and who to contact so

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,000
we use Google Sites and this is a

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,200
example of what it looks like in a sec I

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,600
can share these slides with everyone if

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:26,750
you want so so it's really really simple

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,100
basic Google site once I'd done one I

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,030
could copy and paste it into all the

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,040
different processes so so our bonus tip

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,350
create email templates for common emails

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,760
you send so that an example a few

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,510
examples of the type of emails that

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,520
we've got templated welcome onboarding

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,940
they actually now automated as well so

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,920
they just go straight into an automation

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,950
design and development proof emails so

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,260
proof one proof to approval emails

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,440
reporting emails answers to common

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,750
questions we also add them to our FAQs

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,310
pages they come up and we use Evernote

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,350
to store our email templates so we can

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,920
access them easily from anywhere

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,590
okay so the next one implement recurring

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,420
revenue streams so this can help take

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,610
some of the pressure off and this is how

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,210
I changed my business to be able to take

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,770
six months off so I want to this day I'm

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,140
still not worrying about where my next

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,380
projects coming I actually have no new

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,060
projects since coming back from leaf I

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,880
haven't gone looking for them and I'm

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,370
not stressed about finding them so some

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,900
sources of recurring revenue I'd say

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,620
half of this at least are doing website

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:42,680
maintenance are we website maintenance

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,720
oh okay so it's compulsory for it has to

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,880
be compulsory for your clients so you've

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,010
built them a website what happens next

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,850
are you letting them look after it

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:55,040
maintain it update it back it up so we

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,570
only work with clients on new projects

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,910
who will invest in keeping their website

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,530
up-to-date optimized and secure we

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,450
include the first three months as part

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,830
of the project to show value and if they

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,750
choose not to proceed with ongoing

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,550
maintenance and in the future they need

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,140
changes on their site will refer them to

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,650
someone who's happy to take them on in

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,490
this manner taking on existing previous

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,010
clients that don't maintain their site

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,620
it's a horrible project isn't it so it's

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,010
just a rule we've set and it works hmm

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,630
we probably have nearly 100 percent

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,210
conversion rate from new projects going

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,670
on to maintenance maintenance plans so

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:35,000
hosting you're not clicking the button

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,190
sorry hosting and so many hosts offer

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,170
reselling packages I choose my host

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,540
based on support and I prefer live chat

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,530
I hate being on the phone affiliates are

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,230
another way to earn money through

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,210
hosting in our company we personally

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,820
work with SiteGround to resell packages

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,290
and WP engine as an affiliate but there

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,150
are hundreds of options to choose from

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,820
and you need to find one that's reliable

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,640
for working with you finding an

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,730
affiliate program that works for you is

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,940
an awesome alternative so yeah SEO PPC

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,620
social content management create

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,510
packages and offer them as add-ons for

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,260
your clients you can outsource these as

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,610
necessary or work with other contractors

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,810
you don't have to be at gun at

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,760
everything so all these things I'm

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,240
talking about you don't need to do it

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,369
all

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,279
so you can refer and get a referral fee

00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,720
you don't have to do it all trying to be

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,309
an expert at everything is something

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,619
that can contribute to being overwhelmed

00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,149
and on the verge of burnout you

00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:35,269
shouldn't be everything for every

00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:37,970
project so retainers so you seek of

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:42,619
sending invoices to the same clients for

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:47,269
odd jobs probably two years ago a lot of

00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:50,329
my invoices were for $150 $300 $70 that

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,860
takes time and it costs money so the

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,170
same clients are getting the same like

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,119
odd job standing here and there how

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,129
about forgetting to invoice completely I

00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:59,740
still do it now for those clients that I

00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:02,149
haven't managed to do it on retainers so

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,470
three months will go by and I have to

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,160
invoice for the last three months worth

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,920
of odd jobs that can be a little awkward

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,689
sending them an invoice that way the

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,639
simplest answer is retainers or time

00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,410
blocks you invoice less often and have

00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,899
to set up and have set up recurring

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,939
revenue so you don't forget the only

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,559
time I'll offer discounted rates is for

00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:23,209
retainers or time.look simply because

00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,420
they decrease the amount of admin work

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:28,009
so last year this was my big goal was in

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,089
implementing recurring revenue streams

00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:33,679
I've gone from nearly a hundred percent

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,049
project-based income to seventy-five

00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,799
percent of my income goal recurring

00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:41,350
revenue hence why I'm not out there

00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:46,009
looking for a lot of new work right now

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:51,170
so increasing your rates under charging

00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:53,179
your clients okay thanks fest so cha who

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,970
here has charged less than a thousand

00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,970
dollars for a website I have

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:05,699
significantly discounted websites for

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,920
family or friends I have started a

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,240
project undercharged lost interest and

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,699
ended up being a horrible experience for

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,380
everyone okay so under charging your

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,850
clients is not only detrimental to your

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,250
business but it does the client an

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,010
actual disservice you can't help anyone

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,139
if your business isn't profitable so

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,660
quick side note under charging also

00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,399
devalues our industry it's really hard

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,709
for clients to understand the value of

00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,720
our work when we're not charging enough

00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,000
for our time our knowledge and our

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,540
services increasing our rates will

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,870
benefit our whole community okay so

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,190
things to do work with less clients pick

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,690
and choose the clients that you enjoy

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,980
working with the values align this is

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,959
something that again has changed my

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,260
business so I don't work with everyone I

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,630
am happy to say no and but I do have a

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,310
base of other designers and developers

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,649
that I can refer that work on to that

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,260
they might be better suited to it's

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,790
better for me it's better for them we're

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,000
all going to enjoy the project a little

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,410
bit more dive deeper into projects so

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,060
you can spend more time with these

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,589
clients you can dive deeper into their

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,420
wants and needs you can spend time

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,949
researching the best solution and take

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,410
the time to implement it in the best way

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:22,470
possible so by working with less clients

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,449
and charging more I'm able to offer them

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,130
a better solution I'm not rushing

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,819
through their job to get to the next one

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,980
to get to the next payday

00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:33,750
simply offer a better service you can be

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,000
more available to those clients you're

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,190
not managing five projects a month

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,839
you're only got one or two have time for

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,720
a weekly catch-up and a review of their

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,230
project communication is key on all

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,230
parts

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,699
when I first started we'd go two or

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,589
three weeks working on a project and not

00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,879
having any input from the client all of

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,230
a sudden the client sees what we've done

00:13:53,879 --> 00:14:00,600
and like oh okay they've got no idea by

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,249
giving them a weekly update saying this

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,660
is what we've done this week this is our

00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:05,999
plan for the next week and this is what

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,829
we need from you that communication adds

00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:11,970
value to them they know where we're at

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:14,399
they understand a little bit better okay

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,959
so challenge I'd love for everyone in

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,519
this room to charge 20% more on their

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:22,619
next project so there's a bit of a so

00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,239
then you can keep increasing until you

00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:26,910
start getting pushback you'll be

00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,860
surprised at how far you'll get be

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,629
confident with your value do not compete

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,399
based on price do not negotiate do not

00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:34,619
discount know your worth and you'll be

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,350
surprised what happens so I did this

00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:42,629
probably three years ago I'm still doing

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,920
it okay so next hire staff

00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,499
so this is where documenting processes

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,420
comes in really handy deciding what

00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:50,910
tasks you want to hand over to someone

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,899
else in advance when I took on my first

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,670
part-timer

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,319
I used a project management app to

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,209
create the set of tasks I wanted her to

00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:59,299
complete and I set them up as recurring

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,619
based on on when I needed her to do them

00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,629
from simple things like signing on that

00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,920
day via skype and sending me an email of

00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,319
what she achieved that day in the

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,809
afternoon - more detailed tasks such as

00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:14,129
blog writing with briefs ready to go and

00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:15,899
setting up social media schedules having

00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,939
this ready before her first day allowed

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,709
her to be more confident which as she

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:23,399
needed she knew what she needed to do

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:25,649
and now two years later has led to her

00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,110
managing her own tasks with zero input

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,029
from me she knows what's expected of her

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,459
and she actually generates work without

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,829
me needing to to get too involved so

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,619
I'll get emails at the end of day saying

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,790
hey we've noticed we're missing this

00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:41,490
opportunity with this client I'm gonna

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,850
email them tomorrow I'm constantly

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,470
replying great work let's do that can we

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,910
and I'm and I'm thinking okay so there's

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,679
another opportunity with this client did

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,989
you want to take control of that so it's

00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,610
fantastic and it came down to having

00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,610
everything documented before she started

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:08,500
so should you outsource or employ it so

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:11,290
what to outsource II I didn't what kind

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,300
of jobs can you outsource jobs you don't

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,300
like so who here likes bookkeeping

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,850
accounting admin and emails there's bas

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,560
bookkeepers and accountants for that

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,960
jobs you aren't good at I'm not a

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,160
copywriter and I'm not a developer so I

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,560
have those those people around me jobs

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,070
you don't have time for social media

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,910
blogging and sales should you outsource

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,260
or employ

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,330
what's the difference so we outsource an

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,029
employee we outsource through a number

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,440
of avenues the longest she's now apart

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,990
she's now our full-time staff member but

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,570
our longest-standing staff member was

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,070
through an agency and that works well

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,410
she feels supported by her peers at the

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,529
agency and receives additional ongoing

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:00,820
training employing enhance at the time

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:02,080
was something I couldn't take on but I

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,559
was involved quite a bit of it in my

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,819
previous previous court corporate life

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,589
there's a lot more responsibly legally

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,280
and financially speaking and it's not

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,610
for everyone if you haven't hired before

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,280
start with outsourcing so where to find

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,290
staff so I've used a couple of these

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,270
some work better than others they work

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:27,600
different for everyone online jobs dot

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,600
pH

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,720
upwork agencies like outsourcing angel

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,100
we've had great success with networking

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,800
WordCamp there's a job sport outside and

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:47,130
I had a job last year that I called out

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,930
for okay setting boundaries boundaries

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,400
are a really personal decision and these

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,370
are just some suggestions based on what

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,500
have worked for me I'm a bit of a tough

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,750
cookie when it comes to boundaries and I

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,540
have zero issue with firing clients who

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,810
don't respect them okay so set

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,570
boundaries for client staff and yourself

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,100
so a few opportunities here are turning

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,980
off email notifications on your phone or

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,160
removing them completely those little

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,960
buggers are distracting boomerang for

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,690
Gmail is also great for allowing your

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,860
apply in your own time so there's times

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,180
where we all work at 9 o'clock at night

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,520
we don't want our clients to know that

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,150
so you can use the app to send it at 10

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,400
o'clock the next morning where are we do

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:33,050
not disturb feature on your phone mine

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,220
goes from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. so I don't

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,270
unless I go looking for text messages

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,750
Facebook or anything like that I don't

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,820
see it and use a support ticket system

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,170
and not a mouse for client support you

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,280
really need to check that once or twice

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,570
a day my clients if there's an emergency

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,100
they have my mobile number but they're

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,480
very aware that they don't call it

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,280
unless it's an emergency and they're

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,430
actually educated on what an emergency

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,270
is so you know an emergency is not

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,670
uploading a blog implement set hours of

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,810
work separate your work and personal

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:09,030
time set times to action certain tasks

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,630
so for example I check my emails at

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,490
10:00 and 3:00 only boomerang also has a

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,110
really cool pause feature so your emails

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,940
don't tick through into your Inbox

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:22,380
I do understand that we're mostly

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,750
business owners and it isn't always

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,000
realistic but the goal is to make my

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,210
working hour out of hours of rare

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,610
exception and not the rule have a

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,890
communications policy so mine is

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,810
obviously super strict and it's not for

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,540
everyone and I hate talking on the phone

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,340
so 99% of communication is via email

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,970
before I start working with a client

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,320
there

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,350
a form that they fill out and one of the

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,390
question is are you comfortable working

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,310
mostly through email this isn't to say

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,170
that we don't have phone calls it's just

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,440
to say that the majority of contact is

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,000
by email I do have a business number

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,520
which goes to a voicemail and then is

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,010
sent to me via email which is amazing

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,720
it also weeds out the telemarketers so I

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,720
don't pick up the phone waste time

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,310
wasting with telemarketers and once a

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,660
site goes live maintenance clients have

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,550
access to my mobile number with strict

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,010
instructions to text in an emergency

00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,940
with clear expectations around what

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,680
constitutes an emergency yes it's harsh

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,080
the key here is communicating the

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,310
purpose behind the policy so I explained

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,230
to my clients at the less time I spend

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,090
on my phone the more time I have to work

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,790
on their projects and effectively keeps

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,200
their bills down it's super simple so

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,450
I'm happy to share this policy with

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,680
anyone if you'd like just have a chat to

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,440
me later pass me your email and I'll

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,600
send it out take it tweak it and just

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,920
make it your own

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,950
okay so a couple of little extra tips

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,670
that you might find useful take a

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,380
business development course I'm a really

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,430
big fan in the last four years I've

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,560
probably done three okay so a couple

00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,700
area recommend WP elevation with Troy

00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,100
Dean I think there's probably quite a

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,120
few people in the room that have done it

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,530
build a business that works without you

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
I don't think Charlie does this anymore

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,670
I'll have to check

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,430
Jennifer born profit profitable project

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,900
plan she's actually reached where he met

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,550
so it's gonna be three courses in one

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,330
over the space of a year so that'd be

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:18,540
really good value reward yourself set

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,130
goals weekly monthly quarterly and set

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,180
appropriate Awards weekly might be a

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,710
dinner out with a friend

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,750
yearly could be that holiday what you've

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,700
had your eye on do not disturb use do

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,170
not disturb on your phone it's genius

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,480
and walk away so if you're suffering

00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,100
from mental block or frustration simply

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
walk away take fifteen minutes to do

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,180
something non-work-related go for a walk

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,360
outside if it's really bad i watch your

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:48,080
show on netflix

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:52,399
okay some final thoughts healthy

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,720
work-life balance benefits everyone so

00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:55,220
it's not just about you it's great for

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,409
your business your staff your clients

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,120
your frit and family and friends makes

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,980
it easier to get up and for work in the

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,120
morning it helps you focus on your

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,570
family and personal life with less

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,980
distractions it will reduce anxiety it

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,289
will help you with longevity in your

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,750
business start with just one or two

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:14,510
changes I've showed a lot today and I've

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,000
only touched very briefly on it and it

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,580
can seem a little overwhelming and not

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,990
everything will be right for everyone

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,399
start with one or two other actions that

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,500
resonate with you and you'll start to

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:27,260
see a difference quite quickly as I

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,789
mentioned before and I've already said

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,100
that happy to chat with anyone so feel

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,960
free to get in touch if you want to copy

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,370
other slides or that onboarding document

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,610
you're more than welcome and I'll send

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:41,190
it over thank you any questions thank

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:45,349
you

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,349
[Applause]

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,350
but there's another one

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,460
so I do a Polock don't my still on I do

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:10,290
apologize for standing behind there the

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:14,940
baby brain is real like I proposed like

00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:19,080
a contract yep

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,270
I initially used the one I said contract

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,490
killer

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,960
there's a template online and I believe

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,110
it's free so if you've using software

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,730
black proposal better proposals or

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,400
something like that there's heaps of

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,500
templates but you tweak it and make it

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,780
your own and use your own voice and then

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,280
again that helps attract the clients

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,790
that are going to work best with you so

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,330
mine as I'm very blunt I'm I say it like

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,640
it is

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,980
and I say it up front so I don't hide

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,540
the fact that I hide behind email I'm an

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,590
introvert I don't hide that I'm strict

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,850
if we're gonna meet we're gonna meet at

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,980
a certain time and if you don't show up

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,600
you get charged so that's all in my

00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,160
contract so that they know that straight

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,630
up clients that don't work like that

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,920
don't work with me and that's fine

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:08,700
so contract templates so you leave there

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:14,130
are plenty online do you use a proposal

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,390
software no so better proposals are used

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,000
for a really long time I'm just in the

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,160
middle of moving to dub Sado so the

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,520
contracts there are not as in data neat

00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,520
in depth

00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:38,919
hello hi a donation every Wednesday you

00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,950
would be doing a business development

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,099
activities so you share more about what

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,679
other business development yeah um so

00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:49,989
when I first started my business i WP

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,330
elevation really quickly and it was a

00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:54,039
game changer for me because I was

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,690
starting from scratch I didn't really

00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,129
have a business beforehand so I was able

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,549
to implement a lot of the tools really

00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:02,919
quickly I've done a couple of courses

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:06,639
since then as well which is just that's

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,379
kind of what I do in that time and when

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,239
I'm not doing a course I'm constantly

00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:13,809
working on things like automating tools

00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:18,009
in my business to free up time working

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:19,749
on templates and I just set a new goal

00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,399
to start looking at contributing to

00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:22,450
WordPress so whilst that's not business

00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,830
development it's about making

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:39,729
connections for my business as well so

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:42,220
yeah there's plenty to do I am niche

00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:45,489
down to working with only complex

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,190
websites so we only do large e-commerce

00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:53,200
or elearning websites we don't do

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:55,389
brochure psyched anymore and I fell into

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,509
the retainer business of being kind of a

00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,830
marketing consultant for clients and I

00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:01,950
have people around me that do that work

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,200
so I don't do it myself

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,690
so I have in my team a developer and

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,909
someone that manages content and then

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,729
outside of that so AdWords goes

00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:15,279
somewhere else

00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:16,869
yes so that's all calculated into that

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,789
that retainer and I pay those people

00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:20,889
under my umbrella I guess so

00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:25,289
project management management management

00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:25,289
is the key here yeah

00:26:27,920 --> 00:27:02,550
thank you and what did you move you okay

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,140
so I've always been so I suffered

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,790
burnout in the clip in the corporate

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,940
industry in a different role so I wasn't

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,650
a web designer I was in a marketing role

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,300
and I suffered burnout big-time and that

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,970
was my decision to move and work for

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,220
myself when I became really serious

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,630
about changing the way I ran my business

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,360
and that I wanted to run my business and

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:25,320
not have it run me about 19 months ago

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,540
and I feel pregnant so my choices were

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,790
to make it work so I could spend time

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:35,700
with my son or close my business so I

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,610
made that decision for nine months I had

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,429
my head down worked really hard with my

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,980
true permanent staff members and I'm

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,500
just really lucky that they're amazing

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,120
and I had the processes in place for

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,900
them to kind of take over

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,920
I never disappeared completely best

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,420
thing about a newborn is for the first

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,400
three months they sleep so I was able to

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,840
keep in touch with clients and kind of

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,270
watch what was going on very easily

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,710
after that it got a bit harder and by

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,330
six months he was in day care those

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,440
three days a week but still I'm not

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:12,840
working long hours and I think because

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,429
I've spoken about this with a couple of

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,830
people because I've got it to a point

00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,510
where we're all comfortable it's working

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,700
well I haven't found the motivation yet

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,230
to go out and find more projects so that

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,090
has to come eventually something will

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,160
change and we'll start growing again and

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,500
getting more team members but right now

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,120
we're all sort of very happy with where

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,860
we're sitting and how much work I have

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,640
to do

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:41,370
hi I'm performance and you mentioned

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:45,120
this place with a 1000 others so we kept

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:48,149
very ok so and it is probably a bit of a

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,100
difference between Australian and some

00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:51,750
of the countries over here because the

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,140
rates of Payard are different so that

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,760
was just an example number I myself

00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,610
don't take clients under 7 and a half

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,799
now I just pulled that number out

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:05,399
because for me that's the minimum amount

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,470
we need to make to pay for my my stuff

00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:09,090
for me to be paid for my business to be

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,549
profitable that's what you were those

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,830
are the numbers you've got to look at so

00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,840
how much you want to take home how many

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,700
jobs you want to work on a month so that

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,450
that's what I'd be looking at is how

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,190
much you want to work in a month how

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,990
many clients you can comfortably take on

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,580
in the hours you want to work and it's

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,870
about adding value in that time for your

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,299
clients so that they can justify paying

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,299
it that's right

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,950
design a double efficiency my question

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,910
is like oh you are working 50 hours two

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:46,310
days 15 hours a week yeah so don't you I

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,680
would feel like you can do or you are

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:56,450
losing also somebody in your and have a

00:29:48,680 --> 00:30:00,650
letter like that so an example week on

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,810
Mondays we wake up go for a walk with my

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,890
son we come home here as a nap I quickly

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,330
check emails just to make sure

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,950
everything's running smoothly and I

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,160
check in with my staff member that works

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,440
on Monday he wakes up we go to the park

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,630
we go back he has lunch she goes to bed

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,680
same thing I just quickly checked so I'm

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,700
a business owner I'm still going to

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,650
check and make sure everything's running

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,740
smoothly that's never think that'll ever

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,720
disappear in the afternoon we play his

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,220
dad comes home we spend time together he

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,560
goes to bed I'm not going to work at

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,090
night come Tuesday it's very similar

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,820
except for the hours between 10:00 and

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:34,910
3:00 I'm actually at my job at my desk

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,860
doing work physical work whether it's

00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,630
just project management a little bit of

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,090
design which I don't touch on very often

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,490
anymore so that kind of continues

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:48,260
throughout the week my week is full with

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:49,970
a little one and I guess at one point I

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,970
will want to take on more and I'm

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,770
working on gnashing a little bit and

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,750
having my messaging around the right

00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:59,210
websites that I want to take on but

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,100
because I'm built my business to be

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,650
sustainable without taking those

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,070
projects on I can get my business now

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,960
ready to do that in the right way so I'm

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,330
not having to take on the bottom feeders

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,830
to keep paying everyone if that makes

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:19,010
sense so the goal is there to go out and

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,440
keep building definitely but at the

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,620
moment I don't have to and I don't want

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,610
to yeah simple as that

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:34,470
hi thanks for the talk I think one of

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:38,190
the key ingredients for here mention

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:42,860
often is maintenance plans right but how

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,860
does the baby nurse brands work if you

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:53,650
my developer so he works my

00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,020
developerworks 20 hours a week and he

00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:58,750
works permanently Monday Wednesday and

00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:02,560
Friday and he's genuinely on call

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:05,380
Tuesday and Wednesdays if needed he

00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,940
works he's permanent on those other days

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,370
from on those three days for me and on

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,650
the other two he works with other people

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,480
that I know as well so he's genuinely

00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,730
able to sort of fix things in the mean

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,530
worst case I'm on the two days that he's

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,390
off so I can generally manage something

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,730
whether I go to the hosting company and

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,820
sort it out so I've kind of scheduled

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,210
our time so that there's always someone

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,830
there that can do it if that makes sense

00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,750
my permanent staff full time staff

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,960
member works Monday to Friday 9:00 to

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,520
5:00 so all inquiries tend to go through

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,000
her and she for them filters them out

00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,200
who they need and she communicates with

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,540
the clients turnaround some things like

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,490
that so there everyone's like no one's

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,320
emails are sitting there unanswered and

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,830
so that I think that's it communication

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,290
is key with things like that yeah I also

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,940
have another thing a my out of office is

00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,530
on all the time

00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,180
and it's not saying that I'm out of

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,430
office it's saying these are my hours I

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,870
work this is why I do it and this is the

00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,610
process if something has gone wrong and

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,680
because standard people email yourself

00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,690
email you as the business owner all the

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:13,770
time it's about educating them to email

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:13,770
either support or our project hello at

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,660
thank you

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,710
but at some point to open came back but

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,080
you have time for only one so how do you

00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,260
say no to a good light without risking

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:38,510
losing them or if you've got to say no

00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:44,870
you find someone you find someone you

00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:46,070
trust or you hire so there's been times

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,539
where people have come to me and I

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,010
haven't wanted to work with them because

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,090
it's not a right fit but there's also

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,220
been times where it's not a right fit

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,809
for me in my life so I've had to turn

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,279
people away because I didn't want to

00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:56,539
take on projects at seven months

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,029
pregnant because I knew it wasn't going

00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:01,460
to be it wasn't going to finish at the

00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:04,640
time that I was going to be able to give

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,559
them that attention so having people

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,030
that work in the industry that you work

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,050
with you can you talk to all the time

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:13,879
that you bounce ideas off is really

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,460
important and you can create

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,230
relationships with those people to share

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,040
work so I've got a really close-knit

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,060
group of web designers and developers

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,089
one was actually pregnant just before

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,399
myself all her clients her out of office

00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:31,040
was if there's any issues go to Haley

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,929
when I went on life it was I had my team

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,820
set up but if I had any projects come in

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,510
and I couldn't take on I did pass them

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:42,020
over to her and have a contract so we

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:45,320
did have a contract saying that there

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,000
was referral fees so we were both paid

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,099
if something happened

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,540
her clients went back to her because she

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:53,089
had a good relationship with them and

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,280
it's it's again communications so I was

00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:56,300
very clear with my clients that I was

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,990
pregnant that's the reason I couldn't

00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,880
take it on

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,940
Scholz gonna look after you she was

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,589
amazing and just having that rapport

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,750
with them David they they they've come

00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:07,160
back and hers it's gone back to her so

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,990
but I also have a good relationship with

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,990
them as well so yeah

00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:18,749
everybody thank you everyone

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,749
