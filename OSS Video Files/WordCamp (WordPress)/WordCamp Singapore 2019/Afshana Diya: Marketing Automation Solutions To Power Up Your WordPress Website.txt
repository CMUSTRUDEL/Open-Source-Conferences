00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,689
marketing investment

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:28,730
does it sound interesting good so I'm up

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,189
son our own man

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm working with WP developer I'm

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,520
helping their name with marketing and

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,219
business development I will be talking

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,940
about marketing automation strategies

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:50,570
that you can use for your business to

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,570
grow and optimize the conversion rate so

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,469
yesterday I was talking with a friend

00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,190
who might be interested about marketing

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,250
automation strategies and who I can get

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,340
benefited from it so I figure out there

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,340
could be two different type of paper one

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,710
who has their business established

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,799
business they are probably already using

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:22,549
marketing automation in some ways then

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,500
again they might want to optimize their

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:29,030
marketing automations strategies and

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,360
then there could be people like bloggers

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:37,619
freelancer and people who are wearing so

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,689
many hats together so for those kind of

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,090
people marketing automation is very

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,899
common term we are listening and we are

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,350
reading a lot of articles about it but

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,770
people get confused should they use it

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,630
because there are meat like if you are

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,649
putting automation you are basically

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:05,299
putting bots and Rovers and there could

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:10,729
be setbacks from those so I will be

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,729
talking about different strategies

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,269
from my last three years experience I

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:25,260
have been working with mostly WordPress

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:28,080
product companies and used a lot of you

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,920
could say like hundred of marketing

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,090
automation tools and from all of those

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,569
tools I figure out which one works best

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,780
for the companies and there are also a

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:46,829
lot of tools that doesn't work or you

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,560
can probably don't get enough result

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:53,280
from it so I will break down my

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,329
experience in four strategist four

00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,190
campaigns that you can learn from me and

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:04,560
probably utilize it for your business

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:08,040
before I get started I wanted to make

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,410
sure this strategies and marketing

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,140
automation and everything we learned

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,110
from internet it never goes straight

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,879
it's not going to be something like what

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,730
I will tell you and you will just

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,970
implement it and you will get result it

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,670
never happens right so you have to

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,040
manipulate it and you have to optimize

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,859
it for your business based on your

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,099
audience and based on your preference

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,099
right

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:45,780
so how many of you have used a pink

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:50,100
media for your business I see very few

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,200
so I'm guessing most of the people are

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:59,170
using someone else for managing their

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:02,200
paid media for paid media there are what

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:05,710
we do we want people to know about our

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,890
product our business right so we want

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:11,560
more traffic how do we get traffic we

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,860
set up Google AdWords campaign search

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,520
campaigns so we target the specific

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:23,320
keywords and people when they search for

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:26,140
that specific keywords they land in your

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:31,900
website dig and get to know about your

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:36,490
business right so first we state Google

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,870
AdWords search campaign in those areas I

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,820
will show how marketing automation can

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,410
do it in a very different way like

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,930
setting up edward ads or anything this

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,820
takes a lot of time and marketing

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:58,240
automation is all about saving time and

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,270
optimize whatever you are doing it not

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,910
necessarily it has to be just conversion

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:08,380
for sale it could be conversion for your

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:13,950
block of traffic or anything so what

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:17,380
about you put a google adword campaign

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,160
you are targeting people in your website

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,500
they are landing in your website you are

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:30,490
showing what you are providing probably

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:34,930
service or toes what then according to

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,750
the stat 89% people actually don't buy

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,479
your product did drop by your website

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:46,330
and they just got away so what you can

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,730
do with marketing automation is you set

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,330
a rules

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,750
you bring your traffic to your website

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,680
and after five days on probably three

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:03,850
days win they didn't buy your website

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,780
you get to put them in a retargeting ad

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,750
campaign

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,200
so in retargeting ad campaign you will

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,980
show them very different ad because you

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,120
have first create awareness you have

00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,190
shown them what is your product about

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,590
next after three days you put them in a

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,830
retargeting campaign so they will go to

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,190
a different website and they will show

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,250
about they will get about your product

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,280
in this case you are probably telling

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,490
them the exclusive benefits you can

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,170
offer them or exclusively benefit they

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:47,590
can get from your product right so after

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:51,100
you you run that campaign for seven days

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,070
and then what you can do is like after

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:58,380
seven days you put a different campaign

00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:02,130
in social media where you will be sure a

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:06,190
video we all know that video airs

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,180
effects get more better result than that

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,110
takes that right

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,920
so if you put a different different

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:19,120
content in different different ways you

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:22,300
are getting them you are letting them

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,900
know in different different step of your

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,680
business

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:30,880
it could be like when you are adding

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,690
them in first search campaign they are

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,450
basically knowing the hour they are

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:41,590
creating our then they are you are

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:45,310
making them know mo more about your

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,770
product and you are making video so if

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,550
they purchase your product they get out

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,320
of the list and you can do it all by

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,600
marketing automation you don't have to

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,090
put the campaign differently you said

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,529
that at first and it will happen

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,849
manually when they convert they

00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,279
get out from the list and the rest who

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,799
are not converting they will keep seeing

00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:14,259
your ads throughout the different

00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:14,259
different session so

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:26,160
and then I have tried different tools

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:30,510
for doing this most recommended tools

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,510
are for such and campaign most people

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,950
use google adword then for retargeting

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,770
we have different solution like add

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,260
press so and a lot of things but I

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,050
personally prefer perfect audience for

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,720
retargeting campaign and then and there

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,720
are Facebook and where you can put them

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:57,150
like your audience list and retarget

00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:00,240
them in pre-roll ad and the site ad most

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:03,060
of the people we we get very easy to do

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,029
and we see pre-roll ad in facebook have

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:11,160
you have you ever seen pre-roll ad in

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:13,110
facebook like we see ads you see a video

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,110
and in the middle of video they keep

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,110
playing different ad how do you feel

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:27,460
it feels irritating but the stat shows

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,630
it if this kind of ad actually works a

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,910
lot for most of the small businesses so

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,330
this are the thing you can consider

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:41,710
about ad funnel you set up in a way that

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:49,089
you don't have to put a lot of effort

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:51,640
every day rather you will you rather you

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:58,210
will have different kind of automation

00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:02,320
that will do the work for you and then

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:07,050
comes the automate your social media do

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:12,130
we have any social media manager here I

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:16,750
see one hand to hand and do you guys use

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:21,850
any social media management tools what

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:25,029
so it okay so most of the business and

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,450
even if we don't talk about business

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,800
even for your personal website we write

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:35,110
a content and what do we do we put it in

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Facebook and then we go to Twitter and

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,089
put post is from Twitter right so it not

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,190
on those cases what we can do is like

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,680
using social media automation tools to

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,830
manage your social media content and

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:56,500
just create a content in social media

00:10:50,830 --> 00:11:00,220
tools and finish publish it in every

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,440
different platform there are my

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,500
recommended tools for social media

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,740
management and there are marketing

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,740
automation

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:18,760
okay so and marketing if we talk about

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,029
marketing automation email marketing is

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,970
most effective one and most used one I

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,029
think so what you can do is like if

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,270
you're using my email list and sending

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,700
your customer to a different email you

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,760
can put our onboarding series where you

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,279
will talk about your products and

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,990
benefit of it and probably you will ask

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,589
them to get connected with the community

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:48,760
or your other user where you are putting

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:50,830
a different content so if they open you

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,570
send them a different content if they

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:57,480
don't open you send them another

00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:00,400
different content so that could be a

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,820
different type of campaign for my on

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,490
boarding and more so this will be my

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,270
recommended tools for email marketing

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:15,640
automation I'm already out of time I

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:19,390
think okay let me finish and then there

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,640
comes the marketing reports for all of

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:25,120
the marketer when we put different type

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,490
of campaign at the end of the month or
