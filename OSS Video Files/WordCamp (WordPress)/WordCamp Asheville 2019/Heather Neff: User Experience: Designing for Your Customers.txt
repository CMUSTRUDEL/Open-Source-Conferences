okay so welcome everybody my name is

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,870
Heather Neff I am a graphic and web

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,390
designer who works strictly on

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,550
Squarespace web design but I came to

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,310
this by working four years in the

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,019
e-commerce industry up in Boston my

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,119
background is all in graphics fine art

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,580
and user interface design and through

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,500
the use of doing tons and tons of custom

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,940
user interface design and Photoshop I

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,440
became really interested in user

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,719
experience design and over the year I

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,059
became a user experience designer as

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,649
well so I got about 19 years of

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,399
experience and I run my own company

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,809
called enough creative here in Nashville

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,180
so I'm gonna get right into this because

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,879
we only have 45 minutes today so what is

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,370
user experience so I'm gonna read this

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,070
so I can define it for you use your

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,980
experience design or UX or customer

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,620
experience is the process of enhancing

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,229
the customers satisfaction by improving

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,180
the usability accessibility and pleasure

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,520
provided in the interaction between the

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,220
customer and your website depending on

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,360
how your website or software is designed

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,250
the user experience can range from

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,320
delightful to downright frustrating so

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,990
this graphic I saw a few years ago

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,939
really summed up what I do this also

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,520
kind of explains that you can design and

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,430
have an experience outside the digital

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,200
realm in any type of format so again

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,090
this is kind of really explains how a

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,770
designer might think they should design

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,880
something and then the users tell them

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,579
how they really should be designing

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,040
something a great example of being a

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,640
user experience designer is when I talk

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,350
about being a customer at a restaurant I

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,270
can go as a user experience designer

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,829
into a physical restaurant and I get

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,600
seated I eat and I have a whole

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,909
enjoyable meal and what I'm actually

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,560
doing is secretly critiquing every

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,210
single aspect of it from the waitstaff

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,009
to the maitre d to how clean the

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,680
bathrooms are all of these little

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,899
experiences add up to how I would have a

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,820
positive and neutral or a negative

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,799
experience with a restaurant and then

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,420
that it actually affects how I might

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,370
come back to the restaurant and enjoy it

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,920
again or I might go online and leave

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,349
them

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,420
start review so everything you would do

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,970
in life every app that you interact with

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,459
every website you interactive with can

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,770
be either a negative on neutral or a

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,720
very positive experience and what we're

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,310
trying to do today is to make sure that

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,530
anything in your designing is going to

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,120
be a very overwhelmingly positive

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,739
experience for your customers and your

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,410
clients so as user experience designers

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,970
we our main job is to make sure that

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,819
everything is really intuitive it makes

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,310
sense everything works everything loads

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,319
quickly and you want to be the voice of

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,209
your customer so I pretend to be the

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,950
customer put myself in their shoes and I

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,049
walk myself through your forms to sign

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,269
up for your software or whatever it

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:56,860
might be for your service and I want to

00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,030
make sure that I advocate for them and

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,519
their needs and what they're trying to

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,080
do and make sure that everything is easy

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,970
for them so I'm also going to explain

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,100
first what the difference is between a

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,280
user interface designer versus a user

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,200
experience designer UI or user interface

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,549
design means that you're either a

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,560
graphic or web designer and you're

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,900
actually building out the branding and

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,299
the colors the fonts everything on the

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,239
interface you're in charge of make how

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,310
it looks and how it feels now a user

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,170
experience designer usually starts one

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,600
step before that with wireframing out

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,670
each of the application screens or the

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,660
websites so where you know what the

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,010
strike site structure and the

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,930
architecture is going to look like and

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,840
how things are going to flow these

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,239
particular job titles can be two

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,400
different people or it can be the same

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,470
person I happen to be a UI UX designer

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,690
so as again my background as an user

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,940
interface design I learned about how

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,620
people expect a navigation to flow where

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,190
things should be how to design better

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,590
buttons and all about 88 compliancy so I

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:06,459
take my user interface design skills and

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:07,930
also do user experience design so UX

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,620
designers will work in programs such as

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,200
envision sketch or Adobe XD and what we

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,630
do is we create barebone prototypes that

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,160
would have no branding no color because

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,750
that way no one's focusing on things

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,700
that they shouldn't be focusing on what

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,420
we want to do is actually you know

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,820
mock-up each screen as

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,280
bears bought possible and you can

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,380
hyperlink buttons and links within each

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,630
of the screens and then create an actual

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,880
interactive prototype that you can then

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,240
upload and share with colleagues and

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,340
everyone can see how the application or

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,350
website is going to function before we

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,090
actually even begin programming or

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,250
coding anything which is a really good

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,650
time saving way and also a cost

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,640
effective way to design everything you

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,110
might be working on so design the

00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,080
website for the user not for the company

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,610
make everything easy for them so the

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,470
goal of a user experience designer is

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,100
truly to make it super easy to do

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,260
business with your company and my job is

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,090
to evaluate different ways that we can

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,040
remove obstacles and to speed up the

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,020
process and make it super easy for you

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,180
to do business with us for one example I

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,830
used to do contracts as a freelancer and

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,120
I would send someone PDF and they would

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,470
have to print it out and sign it and

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,060
then they would have to take a picture

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,250
or they would find out they would have

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,200
to put it in the mail and snail back the

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,220
a signature to my contract I said this

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,500
is ridiculous this is way too

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,480
time-consuming it's hard for them to do

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,280
so now I use software that of course

00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,710
allows them to type their name in and

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,630
hit submit and it then it sends a PDF to

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,490
both parties of the contract and that

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,530
made it easier for them to do business

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,300
with me so that's an example of kind of

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,640
speeding up the process and making sure

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,350
that how are you can you make it easier

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,070
for people to do business with you and

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,830
your company so my motto MO is don't

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,600
make them think so people don't really

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,250
actually read the internet they don't

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,180
actually comprehend the internet so when

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,250
they're going through your website

00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,870
they're scan and they're doing stuff but

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,340
they're not really really focusing on

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,870
the details you might have spent a lot

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,610
of time on a paragraph that really

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,470
explains what you do but they're not

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,740
actually reading it so you want to keep

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,510
your site to be answering questions in a

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,120
way but bullet point them out make them

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,710
super super simple you want to make sure

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,300
your site loads fast of course we're

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,470
gonna get a lot into that because the

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,640
number one thing we have to worry about

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,680
you want to make sure your site is

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,590
responsive this is a no-brainer now and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,510
I have a tablet and mobile friendly you

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,530
want to have intuitive navigation you

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,090
want to make sure that every single

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,030
folder and drop-down make

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,280
sense that it's labeled properly and the

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,840
titles of the pages are going to lead

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,460
them to where they are and you're using

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,530
common language you're not using some

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,940
type of specific industry term to you

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,010
but something that everyone would

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,300
understand you want to make sure that

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,340
you're using professional graphic

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,560
designers or web designers that we're

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,870
going to make a very beautiful branded

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,100
website you don't want to have anything

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,350
that looks not so good a da or Americans

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,090
with Disability Act you want to be as a

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,760
da compliant as possible and we'll get

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,440
into the specifics of that you also want

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,210
to have really clear call to actions

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,310
right now Google's changed over to how

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,530
they like to have buttons labeled so

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,330
they used to have you know read more or

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,280
learn more now they're looking for a

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,840
really specific thing for the user what

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,979
they want to do is tell the user what's

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,200
going to be on the other side of that

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,790
link so I want you to revise and think

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,130
about all the buttons and text links you

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,260
have on our website to evaluate them to

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,250
say does it make sense to the user what

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,750
they're going to get when they click

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,940
through because Google's trying to have

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,840
Wow avoid higher bounce rates off pages

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,760
customer service we're also going to get

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,620
into it a lot today because customer

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,570
service is a really big problem for a

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,850
lot of companies I really encourage you

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,039
to make sure it's easy to find that the

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,680
customer service is timely and it goes

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,750
way and above like the normal you know

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,090
average customer service that's crucial

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,470
for user experience when you're also

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,479
designing forms I want to make sure you

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,250
how Thank You pages have you know your

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,630

they're your clients this is this basic

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,229
business you know being kind of timely

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,970
with your leads and then also you can

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,099
set up it within a newsletter program

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,289
automated drip campaigns which means

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:19,010
they drip out over time you can go into

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,180
a program and set up emails that have

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,460
like a welcome message that are

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,590
triggered within might say within an

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,820
hour of them signing up or if 24 hours

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,950
you have a welcome message that either

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,360
has an incentive to come shopping or to

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,099
come back or thank you for joining our

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,570

to join our Facebook you know that kind

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,659
of stuff so you can set up a bunch of

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,010
different drip campaigns and that's a

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,289
really good way to stay in touch with

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,970
your customers over time without

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,800
actually really having to

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:48,950
do much after you set them up and kind

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:52,790
of put them into action so I do a lot of

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,770
user experience design audits this means

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,910
I can do it on any WordPress site or any

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,630
platform it doesn't matter which

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,440
platform and when I'm doing these audits

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,320
I ask these questions to the owners and

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,580
also to myself about who are your

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,500
competitors you gotta give your

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,180
competitor research to see how who else

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,680
is in your field what their websites are

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180
doing what kind of language they're

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,520
using in the industry what kind of

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,740
success that they seem to be having with

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,390
their within their websites and then how

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,590
do you differentiate yourself from these

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,620
people you want to make sure that your

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,970
marketing messages have really strong

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,500
indicators of why you're either

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,300
different or better or what your

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,430
performance is it's going to be from

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,930
them and then also you want to think

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,880
about the pain points that people have

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,620
the reason why people actually start a

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,600
search is they have these micro moments

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,710
of I have an issue I have a question I

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,780
need I need some answers

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,280
they go online and they google you and

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,770
what you want to do is make sure that

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,210
you're giving the answers to their

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,410
questions before they even ask them so

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,090
when they land on your page you're

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,570
offering all kinds of you know

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,980
information either an FAQ and you

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,690
basically want to solve any type of

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,910
question that they ask before they even

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,410
ask it and they also want to figure out

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,000
from your customers what might be their

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,250
goals and might try to figure out how

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
can you solve any of these goals in the

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,360
website and then also making sure that

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,490
you test your forms any other type of

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,300
integrated software third-party stuff to

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,400
make sure it works

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,170
I've seen people hurry up and throw up a

00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,090
contact form and a month later they

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,340
realized they never checked and try it

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,500
out and tester their contact form and it

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,320
wasn't working and then you know that

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,940
could be a really thing that you forget

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,500
and don't even realize for a year or

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,940
something and you want to make sure that

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,530
all your forms are tested on different

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,120
browsers and you test everything on

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,040
different browsers because software has

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,270
a tendency to not work sometimes if

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,590
you're not aware of it that's a huge

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,760
user experience problem so you also at

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,410
this time want to determine your

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,780
marketing goals for the website so I

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,640
usually talk to the owners and I ask

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,840
about what do you want them to be doing

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
here do you want them to sign up for a

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,620
newsletter are you trying to make a

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,940
purchase what what action do you want

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,770
them to perform and then make sure that

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,660
you

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,400
you know guide them to do that action

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,630
and also you want to make sure that how

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,060
do you want to do business with your

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,530
customers this is a good question like

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,610
do you prefer to get a phone call or

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,590
would you rather have them fill out a

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,240
form would you rather be emailed and

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,350
then once you have that preference you

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,820
shouldn't really probably make your call

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,170
to actions that preference so that

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,650
you're doing business with your clients

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,140
the way that you prefer and then also

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,730
when you're doing these marketing goals

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,340
you can review your Google Analytics and

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,330
also kind of good is good to get a good

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,830
sense of where people might be

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,420
abandoning your website and see what

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,310
pages are probably not converting very

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,660
well and using this analytics you can

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,040
also come up with what's called user

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,570
personas so user personas are these

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,770
fictional characters so you kind of know

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,120
your audience already you guys have

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,350
probably been in business for a while or

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,640
you you know you're interested pretty

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,260
well and you know what kind of clients

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,230
your analytics will also tell you with

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,300
the demographics of your your the

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,550
customers are what age group what gender

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,530
they might be income levels where they

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,210
live and what you can also do is kind of

00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,250
basically put these user personas

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,690
together that would be fictional

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,220
characters that you would have different

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,840
problems that they might want to solve

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,010
and how they might want to be solved and

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,450
so that way you can actually walk

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,700
yourself through and say this person

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,740
might come in through an app and they

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,840
might just want to have time savings as

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,730
their big thing so you figure out

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,230
different ways to work with these

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,580
characters to make sure you're answering

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,170
all the different things that you could

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,680
possibly dream up in different ways that

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,360
are problems and that leads you into

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,820
journey mapping journey mapping is

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,950
literally a physical illustration a

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,140
timeline of events so you want to say

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,490
from the very first search in Google or

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,830
they looking at your title tags in your

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,450
metadata how is that actually looking

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,830
and how are they actually getting into

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,600
your website you can look at analytics

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,310
to see where they're landing where

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,200
they're coming in what kind of keywords

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,300
they've been using to find you and then

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,710
marking this as an actual physical map

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,900
that shows you where they come in and

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,070
which points this also will allow you to

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,390
find out where you're kind of dropping

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,150
the ball and where you're like not

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,590
supporting your clients very well and it

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,480
gives you an opportunity say hey we

00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,220
should contact these people at the three

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,750
week point here because that's when

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,200
their trial ends and we're not doing

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,280
that

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,220
you know we should really reached out to

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,270
them personally and again you want to

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,470
make sure you have this relationship

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,180
with them that hopefully lasts forever

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,980
and what are you doing to retain your

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,880
clients this is something a lot of

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,860
people don't think about is

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,360
when at the end of the sale they just

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,710
let it drop and they don't come back you

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,630
want to make sure that you kind of stay

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,460
in touch with your clients and keep them

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,930
on as brand advocates then become the

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,630
word-of-mouth people who love you and

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,000
talk about you as you know they are had

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,300
such a great experience with your

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,930
company so UX designers make technology

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,730
more accessible which means they make

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,360
the web easier for people of different

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,040
ages nationalities levels of education

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,490
and their physical and mental

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,810
disabilities so what is accessibility

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,280
broadly speaking when we say that a site

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,380
is accessible we mean that the site's

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,030
content is available and its

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,610
functionality beacon operated by

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,920
literally anyone as developers it's easy

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,050
to assume that all users can see and use

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,670
a keyboard a mouse or touch screen and

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,040
they can interact with your page and

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,600
contact the same way you do this can

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,760
lead to an experience that works well

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,590
for some people but creates issues that

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,200
range from simple annoyances to

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,030
showstoppers for others so Google has an

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,950
entire accessibility department for 88

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,350
compliancy within them one of their lead

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,240
developers is a man who has been blind

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,250
since birth and I've watched videos of

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,200
how he checks his emails if you've never

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,480
seen anyone we actually use a screen

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,660
reader it's absolutely fascinating I've

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,440
never seen anything quite like it it is

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,380
different than you what you think it's

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,000
gonna be let's put it that way so this

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,440
is what we're gonna get into is 88

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,830
compliancy and these are the guidelines

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,300
for having the basics of what you want

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,510
for your website so web content

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,610
accessibility guidelines the WCAG that

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,470
link actually brings you to the 38

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,180
requirements that you have to have if

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,650
you truly want to be 88 compliant with

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,170
your website it's extremely technical

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,730
there's a lot to it and so I highly

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,060
recommend checking out that link when

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,160
you get a chance this is a presentation

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,420
oh by the way it's also available on my

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,470
website and I will give you the URL it's

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,540
at the very beginning of it and anyway

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,040
so when you get through this 88

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,510
compliant list you'll see that these

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
that I pulled out the ones that you guys

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,960
can do right now to your website to be

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,760
very aware to be as you know basic

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,080
compliant as possible

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,180
you want to make sure that you create

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,610
alt tags for all of your images your

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,040
videos and audio files with the alt tags

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,560
you also want to make sure that

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,650
you are doing justice to that so you're

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,960
using SEO keywords within your alt tags

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,210
and that you're also paying attention to

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,860
what is in the image so you have to

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,720
describe what's happening for a blind

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,240
person what actually is that photograph

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,270
so you want to combine SEO tags with

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,620
some type of description you also want

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,950
to have closed captioning for all your

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,350
videos and that's kind of important also

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,000
no text and images one of the things you

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,160
want to make sure when you're doing web

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,630
design is that text within an image is

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,790
not search engine friendly anyway so

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,940
anything that's in an image is not going

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,530
to help your SEO if it's also text

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,750
within the image a screen reader can't

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,670
read it so it's not ADA compliant to

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,140
have any type of text within your images

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,700
also when you have a lot of text and

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,470
images and you happen to have it

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,930
responsive that same image with a lot of

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,810
text will not become very easy to read

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,790
on a mobile device you also want to have

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,870
high enough contrast within any of your

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,300
website a lot of people have

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,250
colorblindness and they just can't see

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,990
very well or the low visibility issues

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,280
so having a high enough contrast

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,510
especially in your buttons that will

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,000
show white text against a dark

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,890
background it's crucial you want to have

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,990
really clean code you want everything to

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:34,740
work you want the website to be keyboard

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,230
accessible and again you want to make

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,390
sure their text is at least 16 point

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,770
font or bigger there's a lot of people

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,970
who can't see very well and you want to

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,620
make sure you don't go all of that so

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,660
keep that in mind these are just the

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,160
basics for it ad a compliancy again that

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,320
link at the top will give you all 38

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,140
critical hold the questions to the end

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,690
if you can have a great water you're

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,660
also seeing here at on the right is the

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,340
wave accessibility tool I discovered

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,200
this about six months ago and it's been

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,880
really interesting to use what you do is

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,150
you go to this URL at the bottom the

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,950
wave dot web a morgue and you can plunk

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,840
punch in your URL and it will actually

00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,910
give this really comprehensive tool that

00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,130
will tell you if your you have enough

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,630
high contrast they will tell you if you

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,520
have alt tags your for missing alt tags

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,660
and you think you do like I went to my

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,370
website I was like of course I have the

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,900
alt tags and then I was like oh these I

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,160
put that image I totally forgot to put

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,780
the alt tag in there I was busy and I

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,280
didn't I didn't catch it so it's a

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,440
really great tool that will also help

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,740
you find any type of errors that they

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,030
might have and what to do about them and

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,640
it also will

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,740
show you like if you skip from h1 to h3

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,420
I didn't know that that was an 80-day

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,630
client you want to make sure you stay in

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,010
order for your h1 h2 and h3 that's a

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,780
good insider tip that they actually care

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,730
about that kind of stuff and Google by

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,920
the way will awfully really promote you

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,270
better in the engines if you are doing a

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,680
d8 compliancy so you want to make sure

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,940
that your site is following these

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,130
guidelines because they like it when

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,650
you're nice to blind and deaf people so

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,930
there is now a sense of urgency to

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,030
prioritize user experience both for

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,710
mobile and desktop user and for some

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,590
degree abandoned traditional SEO

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,180
practices while some tactics may still

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,940
be effective such as building internal

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,840
external links satisfying visitors now

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,670
takes priority so Facebook and Google

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,770
have both declared over the last year

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,880
that the users experience Trump's every

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,170
other type of thing that you can be

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,760
doing because they just don't care what

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,650
you might be selling or offering or what

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,300
services you might be providing if the

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,740
users not having a very good time trying

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,740
to find your website or use your website

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:40,290
so doing user experience design for

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
search engines we're going to be talking

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,130
a lot today about speed as its the

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,220
number one priority for Google the first

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,020
experience that a customer will probably

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,910
have with your website is waiting for it

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,250
to load on on your mobile device

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,530
so how long does it take for them to sit

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,240
there when they punch in your URL and if

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,440
it's longer than three seconds you're

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,050
basically going to have a bounce rate

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,430
about 50% so we're gonna be working a

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,660
lot on how to speed up your website

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,830
because that's literally the number one

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,110
thing you guys should all be worrying

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,610
about the next thing of course Google

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,230
cares about is having good design which

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,750
means it's responsive that it's mobile

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,090
friendly but it's SEO it's got an

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,850
intuitive navigation you're using really

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,620
plain language and you're labeling

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,240
everything very properly especially your

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,730
forms so it's very clear and what you

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,530
want to do forms are a big deal you want

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,970
to have really clear call to actions and

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,820
you also want to make sure that you're

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,710
kind of kind of guiding your your

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,090
customers to the website so that they

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,080
know what to do next you want to make

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,200
sure everything just seems like

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,640
intuitive what you want to do for images

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,650
again you want to make sure they're been

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,330
SEO to the name of the JPEG has been

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,480
taken into consideration so they had the

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,260
keyword inside

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,670
JPG so like WordPress designer JPEG you

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,460
also want to make sure that alt tag is

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,990
again 88 compliant and also SEO D and

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,030
you want to make sure you optimize it so

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,980
I'm a graphics expert if anyone needs

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,290
like an additional information on how to

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,850
optimize images for the web I have gave

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,740
it a graphics lightening talk yesterday

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,720
if you'd like to see that presentation

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,390
or talk to me about how to do that come

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,590
see me after again you want to be

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:13,030
Americans with Disability Act compliant

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,830
so I call these roadblocks and time

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,600
wasters there's a lot of them on the

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,570
Internet you guys are very familiar with

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,300
them on the example on the left here you

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,380
can see that the little arrows are

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,960
pointing to the fact that these are

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,150
required so this contact form required

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,190
me to leave a message to the person and

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,050
it also required me to do math that's

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,370
one of my biggest pet peeves is when you

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,650
require me to do something that's

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,140
obnoxious so I don't care how many

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,730
street signs I have to choose that kind

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,740
of stuff or if there's a car in a

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,930
picture those CAPTCHAs and that kind of

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,360
stuff are huge time wasters and people

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,710
will actually abandon and leave if they

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,330
just like frustrated because you're

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,610
sucking up their time and time is the

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,340
most valuable thing that we all have so

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,380
the other example is the chat this

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,330
particular example says it's required to

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,330
do your first name last name email and

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:04,120
initial question and you start typing

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,620
your name your last name your email and

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,900
you start typing in your question and

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,520
you might know what happens next you hit

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,460
enter and you get a chat person on the

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
phone or on the on line and then you

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,950
have to explain everything all over

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,390
again it's kind of like when you go to

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,740
the doctor and you fill out all those

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,330
forms and you sit there in the waiting

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,220
room for 20 minutes and fill out all

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,080
this information and you know that

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,180
information is not going to be actually

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,020
presented or understood as soon as you

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,430
get into the office

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,660
so they're in for you're repeating

00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,460
yourself again and you're doing all this

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,350
stuff and it's like if you call any

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,560
insurance company you have this very

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,360
frustrating time going through you know

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,710
trying to speak into the phone which

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,640
choice you want you start getting

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,440
frustrated you start getting frustrated

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,150
all you want is a human being at the end

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,920
of the day because this is a nightmare

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:50,200
so you want to fix that so using chat

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,820
this is the true story I had a

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,990
third-party integration that wasn't

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,360
working the software was having an issue

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,750
I decided to get on to their website and

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,970
they had

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,179
tech support chat I started chatting

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,159
with their tech support and I was really

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,049
upset at the time I was emotional and I

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,059
was trying to gain sympathy so they

00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,980
would do some stuff for me and I was you

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,049
know I spent about I'm good two minutes

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,760
probably talking to this person and then

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,100
I realized I'm not talking to a person

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,419
I'm talking to a chat pod and that

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,070
really frustrated me and I was really

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,380
upset I felt really duped and I said

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,600
this is not cool you know and I said to

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,309
myself we should actually as designers

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,659
be responsible for that feeling that

00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,250
people have that either you're talking

00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:29,620
to a chat bottle or you're talking to a

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,850
human so as designers out there when

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,500
you're doing chat BOTS and you're

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,970
dealing with chat make sure you

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,320
understand that AI is a little bit

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,760
different than a human and that we

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:42,700
should be aware of how to make that

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:47,260
clear to the customer so gdpr compliancy

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,929
is a big deal because a year ago you're

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,630
put into these privacy policy acts into

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,850
effect which affects everybody and right

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,870
now California has also been in effect

00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:00,640
with they're a be 375 laws for privacy

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,350
that basically starts become a user

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,480
experience problem for us designers

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,039
because what we have to do now instead

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,049
of just having a pop-up grab an email

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,549
which was simple to grab emails back in

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,530
the day we couldn't make all these

00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,659
wonderful email lists now we actually

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,059
have to ask our clients and ourselves do

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:18,490
we want to become gdpr compliant do we

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,530
want to be aware that a be 375 is

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,820
actually in effect right now and right

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,530
now there's two other states they're

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,020
also following these laws so we have to

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,580
as designers and developers and all of

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,350
our clients ask ourselves these

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,809
questions that are hard because what

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,090
happens with the user experience is

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,950
negative it becomes this kind of like

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,720
pain-in-the-butt thing and it's a huge

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,360
pain in the butt so what we have to do

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,710
is ask them for their permission and

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,929
then we have to decide as the marketing

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,309
team okay what kind of marketing are we

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,500
going to be doing are we going to be

00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,570
doing just newsletters and that's it

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,250
forever or maybe we might be taking

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,950
their email address and using Addison

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,659
maybe a geo-targeted ad in Asheville we

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,700
don't know we might also want to send

00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,720
them a postcard in the mail how many

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,760
different ways are we going to be

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,159
contacting this customer so to be

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,540
compliant now we have to offer them all

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,010
these different marketing permission

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,660
so you actually have to have a box

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,980
that's not no longer allowed to be a

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,500
pop-up at this time you have to have

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,850
some direct HTML that has this kind of

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,120
choice then you have to explain

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,580
everything and be super transparent and

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,110
this is you know a kind of a big problem

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,580
because people are now having to say yes

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,040
I'd like to check off your email

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,410
newsletter and okay maybe I want

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,090
Facebook Ads I'm not really sure why I

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,830
don't know I don't want postcards you

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,540
know like so they have them in shoes and

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,220
then you have to manage those lists so

00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,020
every single newsletter list that you

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,310
have now has to be segmented so that you

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,280
don't abuse this because these are

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,530
strong privacy laws that are laws and

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,180
then of course this also causes the

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,500
problem of double opt-ins so as soon as

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,510
you become compliant you're now asking

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,070
them to have to get an email that says

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,440
yes I would really like to be on your

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,020
less so multiple times now they're being

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,280
asked to approve that yes you want to

00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,750
join their with their lists and when I

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,210
was talking to a lawyer about gdpr

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,470
compliance you she said if you can now

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,270
is a really good time to start planning

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,650
this you'd rather probably do as much as

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,060
you can legally to show that you're

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,590
trying really hard to get permission

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,030
because the privacy laws are only going

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,890
to get stricter and the United States is

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,230
going to follow suit behind Europe so

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,090
it's something to consider at this time

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,620
also inion indeed ugh these cookie

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,230
pop-ups and notifications on your

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,400
website which again or a noxious little

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,320
thing I'm sure you see them all the time

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,030
now is because everyone's gdpr client

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,980
usually at the bottom and you have to X

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,020
amount saying yes all right fine cookies

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,240
and that's kind of a pain the but again

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,770
it's the user experience thing so think

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,290
long and hard before you become gdpr

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,320
compliant it's a thing to consider so

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,730
I'm gonna do a couple of case studies

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,980
MailChimp I've been with MailChimp for

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,700
probably 10 years solid doing newsletter

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,470
design and I had a customer just only

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,760
just two months ago asked me to go sign

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,050
up for them and they were they just

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,040
wanted to collect email addresses at

00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,180
this time they weren't really quite

00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,650
ready to do any marketing but they

00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,860
wanted to put it on their new website

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,940
that we were designing for them and I

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,230
said sure

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,520
what's the email you want the account

00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,230
under and they said info and I said oh

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,270
fantastic so I went and signed up for

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,190
MailChimp for them MailChimp it

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,720
automatically sends a confirmation email

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,950
well that confirmation email will go

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,540
anywhere because I actually hadn't set

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,190
up their email forwarding address for

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,900
that yet so I'm kind of stuck in this

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,510
loop where I can't really confirm the

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,300
account right it's a simple problem so

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,460
what do I do is I go on to MailChimp

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,740
looking for customer service I cannot

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,750
find an email I cannot find a phone

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,640
number I cannot find a chat there is

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,410
literally nothing you can do to contact

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,650
mail ship so I got clever and I said let

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:31,470
me go try Facebook on Facebook you can't

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,580
even message them

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,900
there's not even a way to contact them

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,400
on social media so the only way I

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,140
thought cleverly I could do is I could

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,730
comment into one of their posts and so

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,740
that's what I did I said hey I need to

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,690
talk to somebody about signing up a new

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,550
customer with you and they said you got

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,930
to pay for that it's ten bucks you got

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:52,330
to go to tech support and you got to pay

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:53,680
for it and I said okay I'm just trying

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,210
to get you some business here but all

00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,890
right so I wind up having it this has

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,110
taken me days to figure all this out in

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,490
time like 45 minutes here an hour here

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,090
trying to talk the client dah dah dah

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,740
dah

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,910
I finally got ahold of tech support and

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,970
I say to export can you please just

00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,280
resend the link to the citrus and they

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,990
said well no we can't do that they

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,760
actually have to email us from that info

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,000
address so that we confirm that it's

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,820
real the owner of the email the domain

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,320
sent an email hey I'm CEO we just don't

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,420
have it set up yet can you please resend

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,990
the link MailChimp said nope we're all

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,270
gonna do that

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,430
secure yours and sorry can't help you so

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,040
my client said I am NOT going to use you

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,090
thank you very much for being so

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,400
unfriendly and a horrible user

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,840
experience and I always feeling really

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,730
bad cuz hear him saying MailChimp's

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,920
great well I had to have Ness decided

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,660
that mails chimp does sometimes suck and

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,210
so therefore I'm putting them in my

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,840
presentation as a way not to do customer

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,340
service so another large company that I

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,230
was dealing with this spring as I was

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,940
doing music you know experience and I

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,250
wasn't writing this presentation was

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,620
that Lanzon sent me a catalog in the

00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,270
mail and it had a 40% coupon which had a

00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,680
pin which I thought was curious and as a

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,530
developer I was like oh I'm sure they're

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,690
doing analytics to see where I am and I

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,400
took this 40% coupon and I went online

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,920
and I added a couple things to my cart

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,050
and then I had to measure something I

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,640
got busy I went back to work I forgot

00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,560
about it a few days later I was like I

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
should go check out I went to check out

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,850
and the the coupon has expired

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,200
so as a e-commerce background I knew if

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,370
I talked to customer service there's a

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,050
good chance they might be able to offer

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,240
me another coupon so I chatted a name

00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,770
with customer service and they were

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,610
great they were like oh sure here's a

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,909
40% coupon for the rest of

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,740
the month I was like haha um I got all

00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,899
this time to shop and stuff and I was

00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,059
like I literally typed into chat I am so

00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:40,429
simply thrilled with your services you

00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,929
know and I went back online and Here I

00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,059
am shopping but now I have a month so I

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:46,549
said okay all the time so let's let's go

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,960
see what else I can find and switch out

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:49,850
some stuff and I started changing my

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,289
mind and you know changing things in my

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,360
cart and as I'm shopping around I

00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:57,070
noticed that there's a 50% coupon on the

00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,679
website that day and then I said hey

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:04,399
that's not cool I want 50% not 40% why

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:06,590
didn't they tell me so I got the fifty

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,630
percent you know coupon in my car and

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,909
I'm ready to checkout and I gave it this

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,919
pin and the pin thing is a link that

00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:16,309
launches and the link launches a box

00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,230
that has an error and I was like oh gosh

00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:20,480
I have to go and chat in with the text

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,679
word again so I contacted customer

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,389
service and I told them that the pin

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,399
wasn't working they were able to give me

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:27,230
the pin and I was able to check out so a

00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,549
week later the the stuff comes and I'm

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,529
thrilled everything is great except for

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:32,779
one item I decided I want to read make a

00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,700
return so I called them to see if I

00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,440
could switch something else and and get

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,669
the return taken care of and when I was

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,139
on the phone with them I decided you

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:41,450
know what I'm gonna tell them you guys

00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:44,419
are making my UX presentation and this

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:46,309
is why this coupon deal here and the pin

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,230
didn't work and by the way you know kind

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:51,549
of thing and as I was trading with this

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,450
to this person on tech support she said

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,740
actually I was on the phone with her she

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,250
said just to let you know we're not

00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,929
allowed to give out coupons and our

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,059
company is so big and the web

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,130
development company or the website of

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,110
things they changed the website like

00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,500
daily we have no idea what the coupons

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,659
are online and she's like so we can't

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,919
possibly understand what is going on

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,389
because it's just too much there's too

00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,010
many customer service reps the website

00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,240
constantly changes and it's kind of an

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,580
issue and I said what's really

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,500
interesting just show that a big company

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,760
like lanza and has a UX problem because

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,830
they're too big to communicate

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,510
internally and that to me seems like a

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,399
really no-brainer for them to figure out

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,389
a way for customer service agents to

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,880
know what's going on on their own

00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:35,970
website so now we're going to get into

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,490
speed

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,419
I'm obsessed with speed a speed like I

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,610
said it's the number one thing you want

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,440
to do so the average time it takes right

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,769
now to fully load a mobile landing page

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,600
is 22 seconds at 53 percent of visits

00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:50,399
are abandoned if a mobile site takes

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,669
longer than three seconds to load and

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,250
that's a big problem so Google and

00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,200
Google dev tools which I read a lot has

00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:02,789
said that basically you're losing a ton

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,519
of traffic very quickly what slows down

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,919
your website images are the number one

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,740
killer any type of large kilobyte image

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,700
will slow down your website considerably

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,080
third-party integrations so something

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,759
like Instagram when you go ping

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,950
Instagram to load and Instagram widget

00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,750
on your website or feed it has to

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,149
actually go talk to Instagram and get

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,100
your latest posts and then display it on

00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:24,570
your website that takes about one second

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,320
of load time just to do that so you want

00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,639
to make sure that any type of

00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,289
third-party integration isn't you keep

00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,490
an eye on them and test them it also

00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,129
made me not put them on the home page

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,779
but maybe internal pages videos take a

00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:38,399
long time to load as well as they are

00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:40,710
both you know their large file sizes con

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,669
tons of crazy content as well so I I

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,019
can't tell you how many times you go

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:44,700
into a website you have a left column a

00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,080
right column and the middle column is

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,370
full stuff and you got advertisements

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,750
and you got gifs and you got everything

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,490
and you know those types of websites

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,320
there's just too much overwhelming going

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,149
on for the user anyway the first place

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,679
the second thing that happens is that it

00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:57,269
takes a longer time to load if you're

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,940
trying to pull in a ton of different

00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:02,970
things and that leads me to the font so

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,559
web fonts are great because they are

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,350
going to be installed into every browser

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,970
but if you're using like a custom font

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,679
built into your system that you want to

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,659
choose a specific font all those fonts

00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,789
actually need to be loaded by the

00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,429
browser's and they can actually add load

00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,690
time so if you have two fonts that

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,519
you're using custom within the website

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,110
that's probably good but if you go over

00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,360
to you're getting two three four or five

00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,590
different different h1 h2 tags or

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,789
different fonts that you're having

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,549
custom that's actually going to drag

00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:30,299
down your load time quite considerably

00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:33,210
one of the things I was doing is

00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:34,350
researching that too many plugins can

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,850
also do the same thing so WordPress

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,740
developers should be careful with how

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,470
many plugins especially on the home page

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,850
that you're using there actually is a

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,870
plug-in for your plug-in as well to tell

00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,870
how your plugins are doing

00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,760
so how to test your site speeds are

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,020
actually a very important thing here if

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,730
you go to any of these links these are

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,800
companies that will help analyze your

00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,320
website and site speed so you all you

00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,680
have to do is go to these these URLs

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,720
type in your your URL and about 30

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,970
seconds later it will analyze how fast

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,280
your site is it will also give you a ton

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,900
of information on how to speed it up

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,170
usually there's a lot of issues around

00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,080
JavaScript and HTTP and different things

00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,640
that are technical that will help you

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,650
know that are gonna be slowing down your

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
site but images are usually the number

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,870
one thing you're going to see and

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,010
they're gonna offer a ways to compress

00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,970
and then tell you that you need to

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,030
compress it by a certain amount of

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,040
percentage my favorite one is GT metrics

00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,380
com it seems to be the best one to use

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,120
for accuracy because each speed test is

00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,890
going to give you different results it's

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,870
surprisingly how different they are some

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,910
sites say that my site loads in 1.5

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,530
seconds and I'm like woohoo the best

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,360
then I go over to Google they're like

00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,070
Google's like NoHo that's ten seconds

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,230
I'm like hold it what that does make me

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,220
sense Google tends to be the one who

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,380
tells you that you're doing really

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,730
really bad for whatever reason they take

00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,650
your JavaScript they take your your

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,960
technical stuff and they said it's

00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,550
really really slow so just be mindful

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,440
about that not all of them are the

00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,940
accurate so JT metric seems to be the

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,250
most accurate in my opinion and you can

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,930
also determine within these tests where

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,910
you're testing from so the speed from

00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,230
Canada or from New York is going to be

00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,750
different because the servers are going

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,520
to be different the bottom one here is

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,110
actually think with Google's mobile site

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,760
testing speed this one will probably

00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,650
give you a really slow score no matter

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,610
what you do just a heads up on that but

00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,990
they're trying to tell you that your

00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,580
mobile site speed can also be tested

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,320
separately from your actual desktop

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,420
speed you also want to make sure you

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,730
benchmark all of your site speed tests

00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,290
by taking a screenshot and then putting

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,790
those in a folder and then going back

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,920
and tweaking let's say you're optimizing

00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:34,340
your images you remove a video you hit

00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,320
save run it again see your next speed

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,210
results and then take another screenshot

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,440
so you can compare each individual thing

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,910
that you do because I can't tell you how

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,070
much like one little thing you do can

00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,990
completely solve an issue or it can make

00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,810
it worse so make sure that you benchmark

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,280
everything you do and you definitely

00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,800
want to make sure your site loads in

00:34:49,280 --> 00:35:02,690
four seconds or less this

00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:04,550
the other day yeah it sounds like it's

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,990
perfect yeah I'm sure it does yeah yeah

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:11,210
yeah that's cool okay so how to speed up

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,140
your site again optimizing your images

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,670
is the number one thing you want to be

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,340
doing you don't want to use a program

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,660
that you have that doesn't allow you to

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,460
optimize images you want to make sure

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,900
you use a professional design software

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,120
that you can see the kilobytes as you

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,150
export your JPEGs and pngs you also

00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,460
probably would like to use SVG files for

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,250
the smallest of cavies that you can

00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,230
possibly get you want to make sure you

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,990
do run any of your JPEGs or PNG s

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,910
through compressor IO or tiny ping comm

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,310
there's also a wordpress plugin will

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,960
help compress your images as well you

00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,330
can lazy load your images and your

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,210
videos it can reduce all third-party

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,860
integrations you can also get better

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,210
hosting and servers that's a huge

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,980
problem as well and if you go do that I

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,540
can actually speed up your site and that

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,310
plug-in for your plugins is at the

00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,960
bottom here that URL is the plug-in that

00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,910
will tell you how many how your plugins

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,850
are might be dragging down your time and

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,560
then this link for crazy egg coms blog

00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,960
is 20 tips on how to speed up your

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,670
website these 20 tips actually are very

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,190
technical they get into like you know

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,420
asking for different HTTP calls or

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,430
actually all kinds of technical

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,870
developer stuff that is way above my pay

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,070
grade but I want you guys to know that

00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,990
there's some really great articles about

00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:21,980
as developers how to speed up your

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,420
website so ladies loading images you

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,490
guys should probably all first you know

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,140
you're familiar with this as you usually

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,060
see it on ecommerce sites or sites that

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,890
have lots and lots of images what you

00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,920
see is a little gray box that says camp

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,480
coming soon or something that effect and

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,640
as you scroll down the images instantly

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,650
flip over into the the graphic and it

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,120
shows up that's called lazy loading it

00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,920
means that basically all the images

00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,090
below the faux aren't even loading until

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,890
you need them so a lot of times since

00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,270
people don't actually scroll down you

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,250
don't need to load a lot of those images

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,260
and that's one in practice a lot of

00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,880
people do especially on e-commerce to

00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,730
make sure that their sites load much

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,550
faster you can do the same thing with

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,560
your videos which is like an on-click so

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,119
only calling in the video as soon as the

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,619
the purse

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,869
actually ready to watch the video so

00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,920
you're loading and wasting their time if

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:07,029
they're not actually gonna watch the

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,249
video on a site that's really good for

00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:12,160
sites that have multiple videos there's

00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:14,259
also this WordPress plug-in to help with

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,970
that and that actually says it will

00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:20,440
improve your page load times and

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:22,599
increase your Google page score so

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,609
images again I'm a graphics expert and I

00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,140
really like talking about how to speed

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:28,119
up your website using graphics so this

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,640
is the basic wrestler versus vector

00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,970
raster images are pixel-based images

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,769
that are easy photographs and they tend

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,109
to have a lot more information vector

00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,940
are math based shapes and lines that are

00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,849
created in a program such as adobe

00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,640
illustrator that are going to scalable

00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:49,480
and not have any resolution attached to

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,769
them so the basics of image file types

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,089
are really important to understand if

00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,069
you're trying to make a better user

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,779
experience for speeding things up so

00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:57,039
JPEGs are great and everyone's fairly

00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:59,890
familiar with them they're universally

00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,990
accepted everywhere gifs or gifts are

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,819
great for animation this actually is a

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:08,739
jiff but it's a jiff of an SVG animation

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:10,420
pngs are great for transparency so

00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:11,710
that's basically what the format you

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,480
need if you're gonna have a transparent

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,089
so the image behind the background color

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,730
can change behind an image you gotta use

00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:22,499
a PNG for that PDF stands for portable

00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:25,210
document format which is a printable

00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:26,440
email bowl downloadable file that you

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,019
put up on your website for different

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,180
reasons also when you're working with

00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:34,630
graphic designers a PDF can also be a

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,099
vector based Illustrator file so keep

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,299
that in mind that you if you get a PDF

00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,349
from Ana graphic designer that could

00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:40,680
actually be all kind of vector graphics

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:43,450
that you can open up and be editable in

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,579
Illustrator itself Tiff's are the best

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,869
quality for going to print you want to

00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:49,420
make sure that all things in print are

00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,640
in CMYK format again see me if you want

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,289
to get into print versus web images but

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,359
for the basics that you want to make

00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,950
sure that you never upload a CMYK format

00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,970
a jpg to the web the colors will get all

00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:02,950
screwed up and there's also a new format

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,690
of images called web P images I was

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,799
diving into google dev tools trying to

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,299
speed up my website and learn all about

00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:08,890
site speed and what I found is that

00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,730
Google is working on their own image

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,070
format called web

00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,540
images web P images is something that

00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,130
they're saying will actually be a

00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,720
conversion tool that they're using to

00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,670
take your JPEGs to take your chicken

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,710
Kings and what they do is they compress

00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,380
them by 30% and call them any web P

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,790
image so they're being used by Google

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,300
right now to serve up pretty much

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,290
websites and their their services faster

00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,300
the problem with them right now is that

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,100
they're not all browser compatible so

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,609
you need to program in fallback images

00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,600
if you're trying to do this and just

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:38,800
kind of keep an eye on that I think it's

00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,230
gonna be something that comes into play

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,140
soon for everybody and scalable vector

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,820
graphics again it's a vector graphics so

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,619
it's an illustrator base two line art

00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:51,280
math work that's scalable to any group

00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:53,080
up and down and this can be much smaller

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,580
in size it also can be larger in size

00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,320
depending on how complicated your

00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,510
vectors are so really complicated

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,359
vectors such as infographic can be too

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,520
large to export but you want to keep

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,160
your SVG s4 logos I highly recommend

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,750
that your logo file is an SVG file if

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
your local file right now as a JPEG or a

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,590
PNG you want to convert it to SVG so

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,810
that when you pinch on your phone and

00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,570
you zoom in it's super crisp it's going

00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,740
to actually be the vector artwork online

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,330
and it's not going to be pixel based so

00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,220
every Retina display is going to look

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,390
amazing

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,060
as you're exporting from Illustrator

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,320
your SVG codes you can actually hit the

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:31,420
code button at the bottom and this will

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:34,480
actually pop open a window like this and

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,490
that shows you that opens a text box and

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,310
within this text block is some XML code

00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:41,260
with some CSS and this is actually what

00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,910
if you take this code block and you put

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,400
it on your website will be displaying a

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,930
logo so you can it's great for icons

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,609
it's great for logos and it's a really

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,530
good way to that's actually using codes

00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:54,330
to display images which is kind of cool

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,530
it looks like magic I really like it so

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,650
a little bit about mobile user

00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:02,470
experience you want on when I'm doing a

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,390
mobile audit a website I also course do

00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,310
your your mobile site and make sure when

00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:09,609
I go to your mobile site that it looks

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,480
good it's functioning its fast one of

00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:12,340
the things you want to make sure is that

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,050
again text on images here is going to be

00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,310
really important so when you do have a

00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,119
text of an image your mobile sites

00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,800
really going to show you if it's

00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,840
readable or not so if you do happen to

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,490
be doing social media advertisements and

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,619
that kind of thing

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,180
it's gonna be on mobile you want to make

00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,640
sure your your fonts are really clean

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,140
and easy to read it's simple social

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,700
media sites like Facebook if you're

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,350
running Instagram ads or Facebook ads

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,990
will optimize your image for you if

00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,160
you're using a program like canva it

00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,330
doesn't matter what the resolution is

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,250
because you're gonna be uploading it

00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,119
into Facebook for your ads but you want

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,380
to make sure that when you're exporting

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,050
anything for the web that you're

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,880
definitely controlling the size of files

00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,190
of your size for that especially for

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,230
making sure it looks good and loads fast

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,820
on mobile and also when you're testing

00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,590
your mobile site you want to actually

00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,050
make sure that your your emails and your

00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,100
phone numbers are popping open so a lot

00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,690
of times when I test some of these

00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,040
emails they format it with like a dot

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,990
between it with it's not formatted

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,850
correctly it won't actually pop open a

00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,800
phone to call or won't pop up on an

00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,180
email to email them right now I just

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,890
noticed that they changed some stuff

00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,660
with phone numbers back in the day you

00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,980
can have the area code and the phone

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,750
number and it would just work you could

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,610
tap out it would load the other day I

00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,860
realized that my client site wasn't

00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,600
working I knew it used to be and I was

00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,190
wondering why so I found out I looked it

00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,990
up and now I have to have a te L :

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,210
the phone number and I have to add that

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,410
as a link and that is new so go back and

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,760
make sure that all your phone numbers

00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,980
and all your emails are actually gonna

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,690
be touch friendly so that they actually

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,950
do what they're supposed to be doing ok

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,090
so there's some software once you've

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,070
launched your website

00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:43,050
you got your website launched and you're

00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,640
in business there's some software that

00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,260
can actually give you some really great

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,790
tips and tools on how to fix it and make

00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,290
it a better user experience one is

00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,520
called hot jar the other one's called

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,740
the crazy egg they both do kind of

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,390
similar stuff this is called a heat map

00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,190
and a heat map actually attracts

00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,930
people's use of the website so you can

00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,890
see where they click and what's where

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,050
they're hovering where they're actually

00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:04,740
looking gives you some great analytics

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,630
I'm on that they do session recording so

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,119
actually captures people's mouse

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,410
movements it's a true story I had been

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,180
using hot jar for a while and I was

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,560
going back to their session recordings

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,810
and I was watching them and then I

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,060
realized I'm watching myself work on my

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,590
website and I was like this is so cool

00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,540
that's what I did Here I am

00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,920
I could tell cuz I was logging into the

00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,750
website and so it was kind of a really

00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,630
neat way to see how people actually move

00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,190
around on your site they also offer

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,220
surveys I took a screenshot of this

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,510
when I was just surfing the web's and

00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,350
survey popped up from hot jar and said

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,880
oh how can we improve this page is there

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,410
anything missing or not working and

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,030
actually the e-commerce site that I was

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,770
on I said yeah there's something wrong

00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,760
with this website there's something

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,200
that's being hidden right now the

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,120
buttons not working right it's like you

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,230
know the text isn't formatting right so

00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,730
I took the time and I wrote them a

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,590
couple sentences and I hit enter and I

00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,270
said hey I'm being a good user

00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,090
experience designer helping them out so

00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,580
you can actually ask your you know the

00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:02,170
public feedback directly saying hey is

00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,240
this working how would you improve this

00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,100
I highly recommend you know a/b testing

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,870
and talk to your clients Nathan bet

00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,490
better yet asking people to test your

00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:11,020
site before you launch it and see where

00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,370
they might have issues or questions and

00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:18,340
answering those questions and fix those

00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:22,630
issues before you launched so ethics and

00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:25,180
UX is a big big topic for me I've been

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,380
listening to Mike monteri oh he's a UX

00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,140
designer a graphic designer a web

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,000
designer and he is an amazing guy he's

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,000
also very funny but he's also really

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,110
serious and I wanted to take a little

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,060
bit of this time today to kind of really

00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,770
talk about the user experience that we

00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,630
have using social media and the

00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,970
responsibility of designers don't have

00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,730
any designers in here anyone a couple

00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,590
designers good so our our our

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,060
responsibility as designers goes well

00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,150
and beyond just making a website that

00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,070
works and it's nice for people mike says

00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,470
we need to fear the consequences of our

00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,410
work more than we love the cleverness of

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:05,140
our ideas and one of the examples that

00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,750
he gives is a sad story but I think it's

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,210
a story that I'd like to to acknowledge

00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,830
and also make people here aware of how

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,140
important as designers and developers

00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,060
what we do actually affects people's

00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,170
lives directly so as user experience

00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,210
designer what we're trying to do is make

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,640
lives even better but we can also make

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:24,910
them a lot worse in this case example

00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,280
Facebook in 2014 had set some settings

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,170
in the backend for privacy and you can

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,090
you could control different things and

00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,170
this young girl named Bobby Duncan who

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:37,490
is 23 year old student at 8

00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:41,240
the University of Austin and UT Austin

00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:43,670
she was for her own reasons not come out

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,319
of the closet yet and she had decided

00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,980
that she would like to sing and join the

00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:52,010
queer choir at this college and she had

00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,839
spent a lot of time making sure that her

00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:56,210
privacy settings were set so she had

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,380
these walls that she had put in place to

00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,180
make sure that no one else would know

00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,160
what's going on with her in her life

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,049
especially her family for her own

00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,140
reasons her family was not accepting of

00:46:03,049 --> 00:46:08,240
the situation as she knew that so by no

00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:11,510
malice at all but the choir director had

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,119
set the group to public and he was very

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,039
excited to have her join and immediately

00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:17,690
added her to the group without asking

00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,069
her permission and they don't need her

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,019
permission because Facebook hadn't

00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:23,240
didn't need that type of thing in the

00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:25,180
settings at the time and more

00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,760
importantly Facebook did not consider

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:31,160
that these settings that she had would

00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,240
be override by the group settings so all

00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,440
of her print you know all the

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,089
permissions she should spend all this

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,309
time setting up all the privacy that she

00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:38,630
sent up was overridden by one single

00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,509
decision that someone made in the back

00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:46,160
end when they did that and this choir

00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,809
you know the person in charge of the

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,640
choir added her to the group without any

00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:51,619
analysis of his own because he's out out

00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,569
and very proud of his group of and as he

00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:56,269
should be you know this is a group of

00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:58,069
young kids that want to sing and be

00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,660
known so he adds up to the group and

00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:01,789
what does Facebook do it announces that

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,089
she but Bobby Duncan has now joined the

00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:07,069
queer course at UT Austin and then

00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:08,630
alerts her all of her friends and family

00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:12,140
to this situation

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:14,599
her father sees this and writes a very

00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,640
nasty anti-gay message back to the

00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,099
public he basically says he's going to

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,589
disown her it starts ruining her life

00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:24,650
and she almost as she commits tries to

00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:26,089
commit suicide so whoever was at

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,130
Facebook didn't quite think things

00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,809
through and these types of decisions are

00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,400
what user experiences are supposed to do

00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:33,410
we're supposed to consider the

00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,099
ramifications of our actions and we're

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,230
in charge

00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,180
we are the gatekeepers of every single

00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,400
thing that we let out to the world so as

00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,769
designers we either have the ethic

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,940
responsibility of saying sure I'll work

00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:46,880
for you gun company and

00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,710
that next gun or the next bomb or the

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,200
next website that sells these things and

00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,480
so as user experience designers and as

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,550
developers and as designers the toughest

00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,140
decisions we have sometimes are do we

00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,090
listen to our gut instinct that says

00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,710
maybe that decision from the CEO kind of

00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:03,170
goes against what I think is good I

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,340
think that might be spamming people I'm

00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,140
not really sure if I feel really good

00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,180
about that but I don't want to speak up

00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,820
because my jobs on the line I had a

00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,650
mortgage to pay but the truth in the

00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,540
matter is as designers and developers we

00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,890
actually are really responsible for

00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,740
people's lives and how those things can

00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,270
be detrimental or improving people its

00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,130
life so we want to make sure you think

00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,630
through everything we design and every

00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,190
app that we build so that we're

00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:30,500
responsible for what we put out into the

00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:32,840
world so another example is Facebook

00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,090
promised interruption free service and

00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,440
what they've done in last I don't know

00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,230
six months to a year is they allowed

00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,550
enroll add advertisements to come in you

00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,410
all might be familiar with them when

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,120
you're watching a video in ten seconds

00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,800
in another video starts in the middle of

00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:50,180
it as an advertisement that's called an

00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,280
enroll ad i as a facebook advertiser and

00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,260
designer I've been running Facebook ads

00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,440
and I was running an ad for my company

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,370
and I was just doing it here locally

00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,950
just Facebook and Instagram

00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,960
when a client alerted to me that you

00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,130
know they saw me in a game I was like

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,840
what do you mean in a game he's like

00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,850
well my computer at work was talking to

00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,680
the software and that software and our

00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,090
partnerships with Facebook and I'm

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,380
pretty sure that the game I was in was

00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,730
advertising enough creative and I said

00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,050
that's really interesting so I got into

00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,940
the settings and I got deep into the

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:19,160
settings and what lo and behold did I

00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,620
find out that I was allowing Facebook to

00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,600
put my ad in one of those enroll ads and

00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,120
I was like horrified that I would be one

00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,100
of those horrible annoying UX nightmare

00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,020
type things where my ad would be coming

00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,220
up in interrupting someone's video and I

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,180
was watching a video of the day and I

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,890
was really getting into it I was like

00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,390
emotional as I was gonna cry and almost

00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,640
of the name is on prime ad and I was

00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:39,230
like oh god I hate these things right so

00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,850
what do we tell it try to do we click

00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,290
away say nope I'm not gonna listen I'm

00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,330
gonna tell Facebook I don't like these

00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,740
things but most of the time who guess we

00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,930
know it's only ten seconds we just sit

00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,850
through it and we put up with it but

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,530
advertising if you have any if you guys

00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,970
have anybody who's managing your

00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,100
Facebook ads or if you personally do

00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,059
Facebook ads for companies make sure you

00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,170
dig into those settings

00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,699
turn that off so that you're not

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,199
contributing is somebody's negative

00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,729
experience with the video because if we

00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,459
all tell Facebook we don't like that

00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:08,180
they will stop doing it

00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:10,670
and so kind of summing up here giving a

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:13,630
positive user experience remains one of

00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:16,160
the strongest factors of retaining users

00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:17,449
bad reviews less forever on the internet

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,549
so it's the most important thing you can

00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,599
do for your business I want to make sure

00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,309
that you guys know that easier

00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,380
experiences job is to go for the very

00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:26,479
beginning from when you first look in

00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,949
Google to those metadata's that you see

00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:29,779
all the way to getting that five-star

00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:32,150
review and making sure that that

00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:33,709
customer has had an in fantastic time

00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,839
interacting with your website with your

00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:37,670
company with your customer service it's

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,289
everything that you guys do it's the way

00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,079
you present yourself in public it's your

00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:43,249
reputation it is so much to consider and

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,319
it's something to really go back and say

00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,579
where can I actually improve my users

00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:47,660
experience there's probably something

00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:49,219
you're thinking about right now that you

00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,989
can do you want to make a list of things

00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:52,999
you want to go back and and kind of

00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:55,640
improve everywhere else I can tell you

00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:56,869
for the humber sensor every single

00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,939
website in this room could have better

00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:00,439
UX there's better ways to do it it's

00:50:58,939 --> 00:51:02,119
better navigation there's better speed

00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:03,979
there's so much more you can always do

00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,229
and if you stop working on your website

00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:07,789
I highly encourage you to start working

00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,439
on your website again it's it's a

00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:11,119
never-ending job to make it better and

00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,429
to improve it and to think how you can

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:17,019
think for your customer and how can you

00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:19,429
speed it up so the takeaways for this

00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:21,559
you don't want to make them think they

00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:23,479
also don't think so think for them

00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:25,309
basically you want to make sure it's

00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:27,109
super easy to do business with you again

00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:28,880
you know take any roadblocks or time

00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:30,529
wasters out you know try to speed it up

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,699
so whatever you can do to make it super

00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:33,890
simple to do business with your company

00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:35,329
is really important you want to make

00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,789
sure you answer their questions before

00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:39,469
they even have them again at FA cues

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:41,959
make sure everything is very clear very

00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:43,910
concise you're using plain language yeah

00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:45,439
again you want to guide them through the

00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,269
website and make sure that they know

00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:48,380
exactly where to go next and if you if

00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:50,269
you don't feel like that's happening

00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,459
your website kind of evaluate it think

00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:54,170
about how you can guide people through

00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:55,950
and also be very responsive in your time

00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,539
so that you know

00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,369
if someone wants customer service it's a

00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,990
done in a timely manner when you want

00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:02,880
customer service of tech support you

00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:04,440
kind of need it right then in there when

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,289
you're looking for help you don't want

00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,640
to wait for 24 hour response you know

00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:10,740
you want to be able to do it nights and

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,420
weekends sometimes GoDaddy's here this

00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,640
weekend that I have a lot of experience

00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,500
with their customer service and I have

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,180
can actually say that I I actually

00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,440
really enjoy their customer service

00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,200
they've really helped me out and they've

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,700
been really really really good again to

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,019
MailChimp not so great with our customer

00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,210
services so you want to make sure that

00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,349
your your customer service is really

00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,119
good because it's so important how

00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:32,369
people feel about your company

00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,750
you know you judge you and you create

00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:35,839
these kind of emotional responses to

00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,859
websites and you have these kind of

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,180
judgments that you make on companies and

00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:41,779
customer shows can actually make or

00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:44,880
break how you feel about a company so

00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:46,740
also use an email signature I know how

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,089
many times I work with new clients and

00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,039
I'm in branding and I do a lot of logo

00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:51,630
design and a lot of stirrups a lot of

00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,099
business and I say make sure you have

00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,539
your contact information in your email

00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,279
one of the things that a lot of

00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,769
companies don't do is they don't control

00:52:56,279 --> 00:53:00,599
and have a standardized email across the

00:52:58,769 --> 00:53:02,460
board one of my biggest pet peeves when

00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,289
you have rogue emails with random quotes

00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,299
in them or they're using Comic Sans and

00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:07,410
it makes you look very unprofessional so

00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:08,579
if a company with lots of different

00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,279
people try to make sure that you guys

00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,130
have a consistent professional email

00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:15,720
signature and also you want to design

00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,339
for Google want to make sure that you

00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,660
work on your speed speed is absolutely

00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,859
crucial that's the number one thing that

00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,509
you're being judged on and the number

00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:23,190
one thing because the first user

00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:24,539
experience again it's waiting around for

00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,609
your site to load and how long does it

00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:27,779
take on your mobile phone is the number

00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:30,359
one thing that Google is actually

00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:32,220
judging your website on now you want to

00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:34,440
make sure your site's SEO of course and

00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,240
Americans with Disability Act compliance

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,039
again there's 38 different things you

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,569
got to do but it is very important you

00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:40,950
want to make sure you're doing your job

00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:42,660
on that and we'll help you in the search

00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,720
engines if you become 88 compliant as

00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,069
well you want to also make sure your

00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,079
branding and logos and everything else

00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:50,519
is designed very consistently and

00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,259
professionally and that you're you're

00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,450
watching how many fonts you install in

00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:56,789
your browsers I'm highly suggesting that

00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,440
you use web fonts as a Friday I was

00:53:56,789 --> 00:54:00,539
driving home I was on the phone I was

00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,609
reading an article on my phone what

00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,500
happens is that I'm as I'm reading both

00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,839
maybe three seconds in the entire thing

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,039
jumps I don't if you guys

00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,109
noticed that when everything just kind

00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,700
of reformats on you well the font had

00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:12,170
loaded and it changed everything and I

00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,460
lost where I was reading and it was a

00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,009
very negative experience cuz like Oh

00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,450
Charlotte where was I you know I was in

00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:19,219
the middle of something here and that

00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,200
font loading screwed it all up

00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:23,630
so be careful about how many fonts you

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,309
use and what kind of you know how that

00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,719
affects your design you want to balance

00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:29,059
that so that is good and designing

00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,039
custom and branded but don't go crazy on

00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:33,680
them on the custom fonts keep keep the

00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,940
web fonts you know the safe web fonts

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,979
that can actually help with your load

00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,700
time and also yours users experience as

00:54:36,979 --> 00:55:13,369
well so now we're going to get into

00:54:40,700 --> 00:55:15,049
questions that's a very good question so

00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:17,660
for the audience the question is kind of

00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:19,069
like how do you know which fonts are

00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:25,849
really web safe this is that kind of a

00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:27,440
question it is so usually web safe fonts

00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:29,930
are only what's installed in a browser

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,279
so there's only about five like I

00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,690
actually had a slide that I removed that

00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:35,690
actually showed all the web fonts that

00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:37,519
the fonts that you have the the idea is

00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,660
that there's if you google this you can

00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,400
see that there's about five or six

00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,920
actual web safe fonts and they're really

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,200
basic they're like Georgia Arial you

00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,940
know Times New Roman there's a few

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,890
there's a secondary list that's a lot

00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,359
longer that includes Comic Sans it's the

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:53,599
only one I would actually not advise you

00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,440
to ever use but when you're looking at

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,420
something that is a little bit more

00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,859
custom all of those need to be installed

00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,299
by browsers it doesn't matter which one

00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:00,979
it is and some browsers might have

00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:02,299
already installed it on your machine and

00:56:00,979 --> 00:56:06,200
every user is going to be different so

00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:08,450
we are you know wanting to make sure

00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,700
that no matter what that you test your

00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,829
site and also realize that these fonts

00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,539
can't add up time so just try to use as

00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:16,339
many web safe fonts as you can for maybe

00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,820
the body and then the only use custom

00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:19,220
ones from

00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,660
like 1h1 I actually used the same font

00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,190
throughout my website because I'm so

00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,130
obsessed with making sure my site speed

00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:26,540
is under 4 seconds that I removed all of

00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,070
them but one until I use different

00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,500
variants of that same font so the fit

00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,420
font families with inside in a bold you

00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,220
get an italic all that kind of stuff but

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,900
it is when it's installing that font and

00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,590
installing all of the different family

00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:42,740
within that font face I'm trying to

00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:47,720
remember whatever you use gosh pop quiz

00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:49,250
in which one its lotto L 80 oh that's my

00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,430
favorite right now so I've used lotto

00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,560
all over Neff - creative comm everywhere

00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:56,390
so I decided for site speed that I would

00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,580
choose one font I would install one and

00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,220
I would keep it to one and there's so

00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:04,700
many places that the font shows up right

00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,990
so there's literally like probably 20

00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,880
different styles that you have to make

00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:10,220
sure that you apply that same font to I

00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,990
mean it's the you know even the smaller

00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,790
text the default text in your leaves let

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,340
her sign up respect your privacy the

00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,170
font we have h1 h2 h3 s we have body

00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,700
tags everything needs to be determined

00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:21,530
on what type of font you're going to

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,030
choose if it's gonna be web safe or it's

00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,830
going to be a custom one again what I

00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,570
did is I turned everything into one font

00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,830
I'm trying really really hard to make

00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,510
sure that my site loads because I the

00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,260
user experience designer I'm going to

00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,820
make sure my site's

00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,380
gonna load fast because that's what I do

00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,280
for a living is basically make sure that

00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,530
your site loads fast

00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,180
so I'd opt it as a graphic designer to

00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,010
choose my favorite font to install one

00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,360
so it's a it's up to you on how you want

00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,520
to do that but just make sure you test

00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,810
your website go back to those links see

00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,950
if the font though that usually they

00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,300
don't want to too much time but

00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:49,280
everything adds up it's kind of like a

00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,230
game of how much stuff can I add before

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,550
I break it and so we all wanted to like

00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,840
pick and choose what kind of puzzle

00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,850
pieces that are gonna have different

00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,620
effects and graphics are a big problem

00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,120
but you got to have them obviously you

00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,830
got to look good again look into

00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,180
scalable vector graphics for everything

00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:04,070
because this was gonna be down to like 5

00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,200
kilobytes like my scalable vector

00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,740
graphic logo on the website is 5

00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,540
kilobytes

00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,670
that's crazy small it's also high

00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,680
definition so if you zoom on it it's

00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:14,300
crisp and clear on any retina device and

00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,920
that's exactly what she'd been doing for

00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,300
all of your graphics if it can be an

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,270
icon or

00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,950
again photographer tog Rafi and photos

00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:23,330
cannot be SVG's they just really don't

00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,340
aren't compatible because they're too

00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:26,780
complex also when you're doing with

00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,300
something like an infographic

00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,680
infographics can be super complex and

00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,180
you don't really want them to be an SVG

00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,460
file because there actually can be like

00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,870
on one megabyte SVG file as well so be

00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,550
careful with that doesn't guarantee that

00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:39,830
it's a low image size just because it is

00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,250
scalable or vector graphic any other

00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:48,070
questions

00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:48,070
oh yes I mean let me go back to that

00:58:52,550 --> 00:59:01,430
so it is this bottoming link here an F -

00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,990
creative comm /wc forward camp - UX so

00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,460
