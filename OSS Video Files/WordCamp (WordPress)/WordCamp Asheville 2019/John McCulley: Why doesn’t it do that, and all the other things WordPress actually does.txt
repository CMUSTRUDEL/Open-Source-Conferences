freelancers hardcore devs agencies that

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,390
are actually freelancers because they

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,340

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,469

people just getting into WordPress and

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,760
want to know some more things about

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,129
WordPress cool that's a lot of you well

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,980
this is going to apply to all of you in

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,410
some way or another but this talk is

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,960
mainly about developers and how we train

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,780
people how many of you have hired a

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,390
developer before how many of you are

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,739
your own developer cool how many of you

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,100
have had to train somebody on how to use

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,960
WordPress how many of you that just had

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,400
your hands up have left and then

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,570
somebody called you really pissed off

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,799
because something bad happened don't lie

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,780
I've been doing WordPress for about

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,810
eight years my title slide here is Duane

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,100
who is so cool from Pantheon and I told

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,900
him that this was gonna be my title

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,210
slide because he was cheesing like he

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,979
stole something last night and that beer

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,229
was good it was magical so thank you

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,180
guys for hosting us and have a little

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,710
fun doing that but the real name of my

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,299
talk is why it doesn't do that and all

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,520
the things that WordPress actually does

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,619
because I've been training people how to

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,540
use WordPress retail and corporate

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,920
websites for about five years now with

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,320
the agency I'm with I'll tell you about

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,869
them in a minute and one thing I learned

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,380
my first year on the job was that I was

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,479
actually a crappy trainer every good

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,220
developer has a skill set that they're

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,020
very very good at something that they

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,030
can do well especially in the WordPress

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,860
community you have to specialize in

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,450
something right because if you try to do

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,909
it all you're not gonna be great at it

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,710
but one of the things I feel like as as

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,069
developers that we have a hard time with

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,330
is training so throughout this talk

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,069
you're going to get training tips and

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,540
tactics to keep your users from asking

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,440
why doesn't it now if you are a

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,850
WordPress

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,920
user and you were just setting up your

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,390
own website eight of these things are

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,370
gonna be things that you should learn

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,690
about WordPress so definitely hang

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,530
around we're gonna talk about Gutenberg

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,880
at the end too but again my name is John

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,820
McCauley I'm senior web developer for

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,350
Moxley Carmichael in Knoxville Tennessee

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,680
we are a full-service communications

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,110
firm we do graphic design we do PR or we

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,090
do government relations if your business

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,310
gets in trouble with the IRS we will

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,310
come help you out I won't

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,320
but somebody smarter than me will but

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,830
we've been heavy into wordpress web

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,970
design since 2010 before I came there

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,160
and I've been doing it for about five

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,690
years throughout this presentation

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,070
you'll see my Twitter handle there

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,050
Johnny Mac codes if you have any

00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,460
questions that I don't answer through

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,890
this presentation or during the Q&A

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,240
period I will answer them via Twitter or

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,370
you can just get in touch with me in

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,310
general if you just want to chat and

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,080
that'll be fun for me so I'm gonna make

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,300
an assumption about the developers in

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,700
the room and this an assumption that I

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,110
had to make about myself I used to think

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,950
that being a better geek would make me

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,000
more successful right any of you out

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,440
there it's okay

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,280
you're in a you're in a place of comfort

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,140
right now I was that guy if you haven't

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,910
noticed yet I have a gigantic ego that's

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,340
why there's a picture of myself in my

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,230
presentation because you know if you can

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,600
see me twice

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,100
how much better is that but had a huge

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,870
ego when I started developing WordPress

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,459
websites right I thought I'm a good

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,900
corporate developer I'm doing internet

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,600
so I'm doing big stuff for big companies

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,550
I can do this and I can be great at it

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,590
but what it what I ended up doing a

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,630
whole lot of times was throwing unneeded

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,519
terminology nonsense tactics and a whole

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,370
bunch of things people didn't need to

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,970
know into my training so I'd sit with

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,950
somebody for two hours I'd stand up bold

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,290
chest didn't be like I have taught you

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,519
to run the world and they'd look at me

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,050
like I don't know what you've been

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,750
talking about for the last two hours man

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,480
it and then they'd call later on and be

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,120
upset this happened to me in the worst

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,859
way in my first year at Moxie Carmichael

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,209
we had just done a pretty big website

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,479
for a law firm in town

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,300
and I was excited it was a hundred plus

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,669
attorneys it had all these neat feature

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,400
snow went in their office head on a suit

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,319
and tie I was like I look snazzy and I'm

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,729
gonna train these 50 attorneys on how to

00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,830
use this thing got through the training

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,949
get a phone call when I get back to the

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,560
office and it's our CEO and she wants to

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,800
talk to me and I'm like oh no she never

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,720
speaks to me so I go into her office and

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,169
she's like what the hell have you done

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,449
and I'm like I don't know but I would

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,180
like to any preamble to this would be

00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,860
great and she said they said that you

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,069
came in there and just rattled off a

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:06,810
bunch of crap and then left and I was

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:09,479
like that sounds accurate no that sounds

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,099
like exactly what I just did but then

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,919
sitting at my desk what I had to figure

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:16,380
out for myself was what did I even say

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,849
like how many of you ever been in that

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,280
you're in their training you're like

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,199
after it's over you're like I don't know

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,180
if I covered anything useful but I said

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,520
a lot of words with my mouth that

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,210
happens all the time right we leave a

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,919
training and we're like so that's what I

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,380
had to figure out because I was so

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,800
focused on this I was focused on being a

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,020
better coder and not a better user of

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
the system because at the end of the day

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,279
most people that buy WordPress websites

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,469
do not care how you built it as long as

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,630
it works well and it's fast all right

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:51,270
these are two things that will always

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,979
win clients over works well and it's

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,580
fast so long as you code it right it's

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,529
secure

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,419
they're happy with it they don't care

00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,620
about how you coded your custom post

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,319
types they don't care about your

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,180
Guttenberg blocks I do because I'm a

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,389
nerd and I want to know about them but

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,979
your users don't care so I think a good

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,099
WordPress developer if you're gonna

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,770
train clients has three essential skills

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:15,349
one uses human words because we think

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,250
javascript is a human word it's not

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,169
nobody knows what that is

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,669
and all they know is that Internet

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,419
Explorer 6 used to tell them they had to

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:25,620
turn it back on

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,590
all right so yetis human words patience

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,389
any ADHD developers in here I think

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,130
that's what make us who we are right

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,419
yeah me too I don't have any patience

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,380
you start doing something stupid on the

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,570
screen and I'm like no I'm out can't be

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,130
that can't be that you've got to be good

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,039
and you've got to have pay

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,410
with people and then a little bit of ESP

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,300
goes a long way right read somebody's

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,870
body language I took a class on public

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,910
speaking

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,009
a long time ago and they talked about

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,840
body language on stage and then I

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,970
watched myself do a presentation it was

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,470
like this the whole time and I was like

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,960
everybody assumes I don't want to be

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,550
there any more than they do but ESP is

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,330
about reading their body language when

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,860
you're in the meeting when you're

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,620
training them they will show you

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,770
confusion they will show you fear and

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,880
they will show you discomfort so make

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,099
sure you have just a little bit of that

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,449
going on otherwise what's gonna happen

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,590
is you're gonna leave training and

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,180
they're gonna look at that we're

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,050
WordPress website and they're gonna do

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,409
one of these numbers and that's gonna be

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,020
the end of it so I'm gonna start out

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:29,520
with 10 tips for developers that are

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,990
training people and like I said if you

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,580
just have a wordpress website these are

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,550
things that are going to apply to you or

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:40,110
that you can ask for help on to get done

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:43,050
oh let me start by following the rules

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,210
too if you have questions throughout you

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,370
may ask those questions you don't have

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,110
to wait until the end because it may not

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,030
be relevant by the time we get there so

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,599
definitely make sure you ask those

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:57,840
questions tip number one simplify the

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,940
interface how many of you have ever seen

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,520
one of these and it makes you want to

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,070
cry right you get up open the dashboard

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,919
you're like there's a lot of crap there

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,449
that I'm never gonna use so this is the

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,750
same website I'm going to show you twice

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:16,080
with just a few things taken out I did

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,050
this in about ten minutes earlier it's

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,539
easy to do decluttering and simplifying

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,860
the interface is the first thing you

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,370
should do before you start to train

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,750
somebody because they don't need

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,610
three-quarters of what WordPress has in

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,279
that dashboard they're never going to

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,110
use it if you've worked with the user

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,599
you know that when it comes to plug-in

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,579
updates and appearance editing and all

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,719
that crap there's a lot of stuff in

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,479
there that they're just not going to use

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,060
now we want to tell them what they are

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,440
but we want to keep them from pressing

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,940
buttons and worrying about how to use

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,589
their website we want to keep them

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,779
focused on what we need them to focus on

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:53,730
so there's a couple ways you can do that

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,050
there's plugins out there that allow you

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,970
to

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,740
customize the admin menu there's a ton

00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,930
of really good ones you can do this

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,350
through simple code in the functions.php

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,209
file though throughout this if I say

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,310
there's simple code for it you can also

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,350
hit me up on github there is a thing

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,880
that says useful wordpress code snippets

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,800
and it's for beginner developers and

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,630
it's just this one repo that has a bunch

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,440
of code that i reuse over and over again

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:21,019
so that people don't ask me how i did it

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,779
because i can't spit it out standing in

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,220
front of you alright

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:29,089
few other things about decluttering the

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:32,750
interface move custom fields up ACF

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,120
users in the room big fan of a CF big

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,680
problem with ACF developers a lot of

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,529
times those custom fields are buried at

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,779
the bottom of the interface under the

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,430
gigantic visual editor right what's the

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,810
problem with that people are gonna hit

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,579
that Update button or that publish

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,930
button and they're gonna see this is

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:49,279
required this is required this is

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,160
required and they don't know where it is

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
so bump those custom fields up if I have

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,089
to fill it out or I need to fill it out

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,320
make it be the first thing I see before

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:03,740
I get to that huge content block choose

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,940
your admin notices wisely any guys ever

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,770
been in the backend of somebody's

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,570
WordPress website that you inherited and

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,010
all the things that they haven't paid

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,980
for or telling you that they haven't

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,640
paid for them happens to me all the time

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm like did you buy this plugin or this

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,260
theme admin notices can clutter up the

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,839
interface and make it really hard for

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,570
people to understand what information it

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,640
is they need to actually use right so

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,140
there's a few easy ways to do this like

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,630
I said there's code snippet so I'm like

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,240
github that you can go get that will

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,680
help you hide these things but there's

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,079
also ways to choose them there are

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,850
things they need to know so recently

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,920
with WordPress is minimum PHP

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,240
requirement they need to know that their

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,980
WordPress websites not gonna work

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,560
anymore so you don't want to hide the

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,959
notice that tells them to update PHP so

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,529
WordPress has several levels of admin

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,050
notices learn which ones that they need

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,820
to see and keep the important ones in

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,980
there so they get the warnings and they

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,770
know to either work on it themselves or

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,199
call someone to help and get rid all the

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,699
other crap like you know if they're

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,679
using free plugins we want them to

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:14,629
donate but let's not keep that

00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:16,809
persistent there forever right actually

00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:18,799
use the dashboard widgets

00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,869
it's my favorite thing to say to

00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,609
developers any of you have all the

00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:24,290
dashboard was it widgets turned off and

00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:26,660
every single WordPress installation you

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,939
have me to cuz I hate them but for

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,649
clients they're very valuable right

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,569
what's the first thing your clients

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,419
gonna ask you for one month into their

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,319
new launch Google Analytics right

00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,790
they're gonna be like do you have any

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,019
analytics or how many people are hitting

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,899
my brand new website it must be

00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,980
thousands if I don't give them that I

00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,029
gotta go tell them how to log in

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,379
somewhere they're probably it's probably

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,819
also another system they're

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,439
uncomfortable with this is something

00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:51,169
that's easy to put in the dashboard and

00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:52,249
put it in their face when they log in so

00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,869
go ahead and do that there's other

00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:55,939
things if they have custom post types

00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:57,259
and they're managing datasets you can

00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:58,669
actually put access to those datasets

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,589
right there in front of their face and

00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:03,410
make sure that they see those things

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,029
constantly use the dashboard wisely we

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,769
all love dashboards in the software we

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,769
use let's make it work for them

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:21,889
tip 2 avoid jargon CSS HTML j/s CPT UI

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,389
custom post type do not make any of

00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:26,449
these things the first thing you say to

00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:29,359
a client because they don't understand

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:32,809
it you lost them the minute you said log

00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:34,339
into the WordPress back-end alright so

00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,660
we got to get him therefore jargon are

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,179
you going to see a whole lot of this and

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,489
it's gonna look like that face and once

00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:43,189
you get there you're never gonna get

00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:45,739
them back if you start a two hour

00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:48,289
training with a group and you get one

00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:49,249
that looks like that you're gonna spend

00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:51,289
the rest of the time you're there

00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:55,369
winning the audience back you don't want

00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:56,899
to be that so don't use jargon anytime

00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:58,579
I've done training in the past three

00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,499
years I've always practiced the training

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,629
on somebody else in my office that is

00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,009
not a bad thing to do if you don't have

00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,839
somebody else in your office pick out

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,059
your mom your grandma your aunt your

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,619
uncle somebody down the street that

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,839
doesn't even have a television because

00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,459
they're gonna be confused try all the

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,799
words and everything that confuses them

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,949
replace it replace that word in your

00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,949
vocabulary

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:27,170
tip three this is the hardest one do it

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,610
in their space

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:33,860
everybody in here tests on all browsers

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm assuming Liars

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:42,870
yeah who has a copy of opera yeah jerks

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,490
I told you this guy no do it you know

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,200
what happens is you develop a wordpress

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,550
website and they work so beautifully in

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,470
chrome that you're like why would I ever

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:53,190
need another browser everybody's using

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:56,610
Chrome right no no my boss has a version

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,830
of Safari that I call the devil's Safari

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,450
because every time I go in there after

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,360
making a change he's like I don't even

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,150
and I'm like what are you using for

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,150
caching what is it it will cache for

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,280
days and days and I'm like we work

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,780
across from each other there's nothing

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,120
going on I have to clear the cache

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,140
manually every single time but this is

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
why you want to do it in their space

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,870
right cuz we're developers when the

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,610
site's done it's not done right right we

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,620
showed it to them they approved it it's

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,150
out the door three days later we're

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,770
still making changes because there's

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,490
crap that's got to be done right and

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,020
what happens we get into training and

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,490
they pull up their antiquated internet

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:41,840
explorer and a gentle tear rolls down my

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,640
cheek I'm like oh you're confused honey

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,830
and that's the end of my day because

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,390
then nothing works after that right they

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,460
looked at that web site I changed one

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,380
thing it's like no because I don't know

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,210
what sort of pit of hell that Internet

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,640
Explorer cashes in but I can't find it

00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,860
and it's in some registry key on

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,000
somebody else's machine using Windows 7

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,770
from 1997 or some crap like that now do

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,930
it in their space few things about that

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,780
not only is it gonna eliminate disasters

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,680
from happening in their browser it's

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,310
gonna be a place where they're

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,140
comfortable so basically you just hacked

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,120
the comfort level by putting them in

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,320
their own chair

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,030
now a couple things about doing in their

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,920
space and these are just personal tips

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,040
not really dev tips don't stand behind

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,839
them we as developers forget that when

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,510
somebody walks in our office or walks up

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,770
behind us we jump like cats that see you

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,660
know Brown things on the ground

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,950
we're developers we should get that they

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,190
don't like people behind them either

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,390
don't touch touches bad thing when

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,400
you're teaching people tech stuff

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:48,660
because that just completely changes

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,780
everything and don't ask to drive never

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:56,430
has to try make sure their hand is on

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:58,350
the mouse at all times because if you

00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,940
don't you're gonna see them do not see

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,950
them do some quirky thing that they do

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,330
that you're not gonna be able to account

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:07,850
for in your training and you need to be

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,850
able to maneuver those things on the fly

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:18,060
tip 4 highlight the screen options menu

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,980
every time I go into somebody's office

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,310
after taking over a wordpress site and

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,260
they say how do I see more posts I want

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,110
their developers name and number you're

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,640
like we're gonna have conversation buddy

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,440
so the screen option menu if you're not

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,420
familiar with what it is for those that

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,860
are running WordPress websites tucked

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,000
into the top right corner of the screen

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,160
there's a little thing that says screen

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,380
options why is that important to you

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,570
that controls all the fields that you

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,030
see on the screen when you go to edit

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,430
something inside a WordPress it shows

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,650
your menu editing how many of you knew

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,680
you could add CSS classes and targets to

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,440
your menus in WordPress yeah the

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,270
WordPress people did lots of other

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,770
people didn't that's because it's hidden

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,350
under screen options you have to check

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,660
some boxes and see those things so what

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,280
happens when we as developers customize

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,410
their menu system and they've got to add

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,510
some sort of class to get an icon on it

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,970
then they're like I don't understand why

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,010
this doesn't work I copied the menu item

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,300
it should do the same thing right that's

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,400
not the way it works there's a field

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,380
missing because I can't see it so make

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,060
sure that they know those things this is

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,400
also when you've got somebody's got a

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,230
big blog our CEO has a blog that's been

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,720
running since 2009 that has a little

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,370
over 500 posts sometimes she needs to

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,110
scroll back to a post that she doesn't

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,200
know the title of or the date that she

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,000
wrote it so I gave her the screen

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,090
options menu so I could stop doing it

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,640
for her this will keep you from doing

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,400
that as well give them that menu and

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,140
it'll help this screen grab is from an

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,140
older presentation because I can't let

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,770
go of WordPress

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,280
4:9 because you know five-o is so

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,280
friendly now

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:03,370
tip five provides short screencasts this

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,930
is an easy win with training we do this

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,640
with all our clients we build in about

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,450
12 hours of training time just to do

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,580
this part because basically if we try to

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,100
do give them one of the systems that

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,230
sells screencasts or we give them some

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,870
other proprietary training system what's

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,190
the difference right it's not their site

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,980
so they get into the backend and

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,140
although is a wordpress dev I understand

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,570
what most WordPress back-end look like

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,590
and I feel comfortable in that most

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:34,300
WordPress users don't so short

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,520
screencasts are a great way to not have

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,190
to go back for training later because

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,350
they retain about 2% of what you say in

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,790
your trainings so if I can give them

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,650
these screencasts on the backend of

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,870
their websites I give them a place where

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,630
they can go back and look in the future

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,180
this is actually as I died this is one

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,640
of our places one of our websites for a

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,050
local boutique called a state they have

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,100
this neat little thing on their website

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,510
that called trends that puts these

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,180
pictures to the right-hand side of their

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,830
events posts what's the problem when you

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,230
tell somebody to put a picture in a

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,610
pre-designed space they always want to

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,500
put something that doesn't fit right I

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,210
don't know what it is when we look at

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,660
some design that has a tall image we

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,160
always want to put a wide one in it

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,760
let's try it out let's trick this thing

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,500
out let's do it but so what we did was

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,750
we actually built a plugin for them that

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,990
warns them on these posts that they have

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,450
to crop the image and then it offers

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,620
them to crop the image part of that

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,810
that's really hard is they have to

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,970
select coordinates to do that right so

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,600
after about three times of teaching them

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,280
how to do this

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,800
this is how our training libraries were

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,870
born because I just created these videos

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,580
under the education tab on the back of

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,770
their website that they can go in and

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,040
they can look at this anytime and they

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:55,000
can understand how to do these croppings

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,620
inside of their website my computer says

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,280
it's going to go to sleep but I promise

00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,280
it's plugged in

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,330
so if the presentation dies it wasn't my

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:17,179
fault I'm gonna move outlets real quick

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:18,860
standby this isn't awkward hey there we

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,630
go all right

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:29,630
back in business sorry for that brief

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:33,830
delay tip number six prepare prepare

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:36,289
prepare preparing is so important for

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,600
training but lots of people fly by to

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,610
see their pants when they do this I

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,990
don't know why as developers we think

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,450
that we can leave our terminal and just

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,230
be experts just because we built it it's

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,450
not how it works

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,700
you should know that anytime that you've

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,530
ever tried to log into your own email

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,990
account when you were on somebody else's

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,039
computer because it's always some weird

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,500
I forgot my password

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,549
I don't know crap my password things no

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,830
work you know no I don't know what's

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,210
going on here it happens and you'll get

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,350
in there and you'll feel like you're

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,870
doing really good then all of a sudden

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,919
one of these we're like oh crap that was

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,200
working yesterday

00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,409
let me about this for a few minutes and

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,299
help you out here so what's the problem

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,220
with that right we're sitting in their

00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,200
office now during their training time

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,700
debugging something that's broken on

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,980
their website that we just told them was

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,669
awesome how many of these that ever

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,120
happened to you yeah oh yeah yeah first

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:32,539
year and Moxley Carmichael as well

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,730
we built the retail and forward-facing

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,669
websites for all of their medical

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,960
practices sixty-two websites seven

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,539
hospital systems it was a big deal so

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,549
I'm very excited about this me and one

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:48,530
of their IT guys launched them in my

00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,230
living room with six pizzas and a bunch

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,730
of Red Bull it was fantastic I'm feeling

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,950
like king of the castle it's the first

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,150
website they've had in ten years feeling

00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,830
really good about it we're two weeks in

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,240
we go to their office for training and

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,640
I'm standing up in front of people again

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,020
suit and tie and I'm like all right guys

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,610
we're gonna do a lot of training

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,429
demonstration on how to adjust this

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:13,740
hospitals website turn around I got to

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,679
log in and it won't login every

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,550
I put in my password and hit the button

00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,470
to login

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,929
it just keeps reloading the login page

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,429
over and over again ever happened he

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,770
goes yeah me too

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,710
problem which I couldn't determine right

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:32,280
there on the spot in front of 38

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,850
regional marketing managers the problem

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,200
was we were using domain mapping

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,590
WordPress multi-site ever anybody ever

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,510
do this down my mouth domain know I know

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:46,260
it hurts me to think about to kind of

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,300
makes my back hurt domain mapping was

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,490
this fantastic piece of technology that

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,840
allowed you to map domains straight to

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:57,450
any WP mu installation what inherently

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,770
is the problem with that you know we'd

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,370
also done a few days before that

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:07,790
installed SSL Certificates you know what

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:10,700
domain mapping won't do update to HTTPS

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:13,170
automatically so you know what happens

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,440
redirect loop on the login screen you

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:18,690
know how I figured that out sweating my

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,480
hind end off in the floor of a training

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,020
center in front of 38 people going I'm

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,300
so sorry guys this was just working but

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,370
I didn't prepare I didn't prepare I did

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,260
all that work on the site I came in and

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,870
I thought I just built these sites they

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,900
ought to work that was not the case

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:39,090
I was totally naive sitting there for

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:43,470
these people another bad phone call and

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,820
a letter you get those things and you

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,590
don't feel comfortable at work anymore

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,840
for a while trust me I didn't eat lunch

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,780
for days people like you going out no

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,360
I'm gonna be in the office second here I

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,400
need to know right now but was my own

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,900
fault right if I'd had just logged in I

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,730
could have called him up days earlier

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,059
and said no we screwed something up we

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,500
got to fix it but I didn't prepare

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:12,380
what's another problem with debugging on

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:16,080
site what's another problem come on guys

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,790
if I set debug to true then they've got

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,250
to look at a bunch of admin notices on

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:23,280
their site right and they assume that

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,280
I've broken something right that's

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,180
really hard to deal with so I'm gonna

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,460
give you a couple of code

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,980
snippets that I use I'm gonna put them

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,320
up on the screen for this very thing

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,450
because debugging on site is going to

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,190
happen it's going to happen it shouldn't

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,540
but it's gonna happen at some point

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,460
you're gonna have to fix something and

00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,340
what you want to be able to do is do it

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,050
incognito behind their back so you're

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,430
like oh yeah just keep on working on

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,960
that right now and I'm just I'm just

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,370
having a few thing making a few notes so

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,110
one of the first things is this easy

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,400
thing that you've seen a thousand times

00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:03,270
is changing the debug profile inside of

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,910
WP config to where it only shows those

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,830
admin notices with your IP address why

00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,510
is that important I can leave it on all

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,730
the time and it won't matter

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,100
I could debug on the fly all the time

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,550
just to my IP address and nobody's gonna

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,870
be hurt by that a second one is this one

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,570
I like to use especially when I'm doing

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,800
API stuff

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,450
one of the things that I have such a

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,300
hard time with is I'm a JavaScript

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,210
developer so I want things to debug in

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,610
the console so when I'm debugging PHP I

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,050
don't want an extra step and I really

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,380
don't want an extra step when I'm

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,820
already hot sweaty and tired so this

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,680
piece of code is one that I put into all

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,840
of our installations it's basically just

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,690
a PHP snippet that will debug data to

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,940
the console in any form fashion and in

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,590
an array anything like that this is

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,320
great like I said if you're doing API

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,630
calls if they've got a big set of custom

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,300
data custom post types stuff like that

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,670
and some field isn't showing up some

00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,010
array isn't working the right way you've

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,720
assumed that you can just cast this data

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,120
out and it's gonna work the way you

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,590
assume it's gonna work you know even

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,850
though PHP will let us make a lot of

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,330
mistakes this will keep us from making

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,330
mistakes

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,350
yes yes all this stuff we've talked

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,460
about snippets wise and on my github and

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:33,190
it's in a thing called useful wordpress

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:33,820
code how clever right tip 7 create an

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,180
agenda

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:41,410
I also learned this one the hard way

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:43,570
I had a training group come in I

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,370
scheduled them for an hour there were

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,280
only three people this is plenty of time

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:52,300
their site doesn't do much five and a

00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:56,460
half hours later I was hungry and mad

00:26:52,300 --> 00:27:00,490
and they were still asking questions

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,230
create an agenda it's as easy as this

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,670
and you can even pick out my typo in

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:08,470
this email because this is a real email

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:09,400
because I'm not gonna be su in prep for

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,260
our training we're gonna learn about

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,330
WordPress basic information adding

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,760
removing post and pasted pages page

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,170
design and structure cornerstone basics

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,970
this is a page editor that they were

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,750
using on their website for a while which

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,190
was garbage section reordering

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,500
publishing a version control design

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,160
basics gonna take two hours we're gonna

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,300
have generous FAQ portion the only thing

00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,500
that's Blake toute and there's the

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,450
pricing information but if you have any

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,580
specific training needs let me know and

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,580
I'll get those at it in I did a few

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,980
things in this email that saved me when

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,930
I do a training first thing I told them

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,900
exactly what I was prepared to talk

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:53,530
about up front this is what I am

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,200
prepared 100% to talk about number two I

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,960
gave him a time frame you got to get in

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,060
and you got to get out in two hours this

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,710
makes sure that I don't get scope creep

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,290
because I have a set price on training

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,140
so when I brought him in there I can't

00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,590
go to my CEO and tell her hey I had a

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,270
three hundred ala budget for training I

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,620
may or may not have wasted 18 hundred

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,400
dollars worth of hours after but that's

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,110
fine right work in agencies we live and

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,670
die by billable time we build by the

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,980
quarter hour all right

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,990
people would get real mad if I gave away

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,690
eighteen hundred more dollars on a

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,210
website then

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,710
at the end I did the magic thing that is

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,960
going to help me out with training I

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,090
asked them if they have any questions or

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,980
specific training needs not that they're

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,169
gonna tell me don't assume that they're

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,350
gonna email you back and tell you that

00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,490
is fallacy and it's not gonna happen but

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,470
what it does is it makes them think

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,110
about it so that they're not thinking

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,340
about it while you're training them

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,659
because we need them to retain more

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,759
information the way we get them to

00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,549
retain more information is explain to

00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,649
them what they're going to get and then

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,879
make them think about what they need

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,879
before they even get there

00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:12,210
tip number eight do I use a page post or

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,950
custom post type anybody ever had this

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:19,230
question some really smart trainee two

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,309
weeks later came back to you and said so

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,889
when I'm in the back end of the website

00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,590
and I'm on my about page is that a page

00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:29,250
post or custom post type like what blog

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:33,799
did you read today whose Twitter are you

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:36,690
following it was probably meissner's but

00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,009
these are terms that at the end of the

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,389
training right before you need to

00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:45,289
explain what they are very clearly pages

00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:47,100
are static information posts are

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,679
information that we're gonna update all

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,179
the time custom posts or data sets this

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,519
is basically the way I explain these

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,529
things to people so that they understand

00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,450
what the difference is because what I

00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,460
don't want them to do is get in the

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,500
backend and start creating posts for

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,029
their attorney profiles or start

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,100
creating pages for their attorney

00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,929
profiles I want them to use the custom

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,789
post type I setup and if I educate them

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:10,460
on what that is they'll understand that

00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,179
they have to do it to make it display

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,049
otherwise you'll get a lot of people

00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,809
saying do you understand the words that

00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:20,399
are coming out of my mouth right now and

00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:22,409
you won't get any further and then

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,850
they'll say I made eight pages for

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:28,710
attorneys you ever see an attorneys bio

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,259
it's like nine miles long and it's all

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,870
credentials and like at the end of it

00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,909
you're like but what do you do like we

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,100
do an attorney and law firm websites all

00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:40,080
the time and I see these BIOS they come

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,490
in Word documents that are 5,000 words

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,460
or like

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,450
yeah trim that up it's no big deal and

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,510
then you got to put it in there and

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,290
you're like I don't care that you want

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,280
sat upon a skyscraper and wrote a poem

00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,420
that's what they talk about then they

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,850
want to put in everywhere they've ever

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,870
spoken they want to put in every single

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:01,309
case they've won their long you know

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,410
when this becomes a problem is when

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,540
they're editing their own website they

00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,090
make a page and they spend all the time

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,970
crafting and editing and customizing

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,370
this information and they do this ten

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,780
times because they don't test you know

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,730
your users don't know where that preview

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,340
button is I don't know what to do with

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,770
that they don't test and they get ten

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,130
deep three hours in they call you and

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:27,590
say it's not displaying and you're like

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,380
cool let me look at it then you're like

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,280
oh I've got to let you down hard right

00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,720
now you're gonna have to do that twice

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,550
sorry

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,740
that's never fun so if we just explain

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,990
those things upfront I tell them what

00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:47,650
those terms mean then we're gonna get a

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:50,980
lot better result in the end tip nine

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:53,540
recap at the end of the training

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,360
developers are just like when we write

00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,150
good code and it works the first time

00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,010
we're like boom done I'm out we got the

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,870
bag on but for that person has logged

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,710
out of the website we're sitting with

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:08,480
the satchel at the door like but what

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,970
haven't we done we don't know if they

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,090
got trained we're developers we have

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,440
attention span so short that hold

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,230
meeting we were looking at the website

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,700
going please don't break it Lord when

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:24,050
they click that button if it could just

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:25,840
work the whole time at the end of it the

00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,710
best thing you can do is run back over

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,990
everything that was in your training

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,480
agenda look at it alright so we talked

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,820
about custom pages and post types we

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,140
talked about how to publish we talked

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,220
about version control we talked about

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,630
design basics look for confusion look

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,440
for confusion because they'll be like

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,030
this I don't know if I got that or not

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,540
go back over it that's going to give you

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:53,100
an opportunity to do one of two things

00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:56,490
one reeducate two

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,350
charge them more money I work for an

00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,560
agency everything we do is about billing

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,090
you more so at the end of the day I want

00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,650
to look at you and if you're confused

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,240
about something I want to make an

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,210
opportunity where you don't have to do

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,590
it yourself hey I understand this really

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,910
hard let me help you out here let me

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,970
show you again if you don't get it I'm

00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,750
happy to support you at $225 an hour

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:23,940
he'll be fine

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:27,120
tell your accountant she'll love me tip

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,210
10 another ADHD trait that's really hard

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,940
sit still and be quiet this is not just

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,430
for training this is when you do design

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,400
reviews code reviews when you're

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,500
pitching selling when you're in the

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,570
meeting to learn about features sit

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,100
still and be quiet

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,930
because if you talk a whole lot at the

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,250
end which is what we're prone to do

00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,380
because we feel really good about it

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,840
we're high as a kite on all the things

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,860
that have happened we want to talk their

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,810
ear off since they only be quiet this is

00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,700
going to give you two very good

00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,530
opportunities number one they're gonna

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,810
ask a question that they didn't think

00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,610
about before or they're gonna tell you

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,890
something you need to know number two

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,889
they're going to buy something else from

00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:12,240
you into the website training is the

00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,950
best time for them to realize their

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,500
website doesn't do something that they

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:18,450
didn't think it should do and this is

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,490
the moment where we say hey that's

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,590
simple to do let's talk more about that

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,600
but we can't do that if we've already

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,000
dismissed the training through our

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,159
preamble out you know we're trying to

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,450
hey I've got the set text that I've got

00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,040
to say to you before I leave and here's

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,379
my contact info and I'm off to the

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,879
office it's lunchtime we can't do that

00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,190
we got to sit still and be quiet

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,929
you know just throw the Shh on yourself

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,330
it's really hard at the end of the

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,590
training I know you're amped up after

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,450
it's over your Adrenaline's running

00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,520
you're just happy that the wordpress

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,560
website worked the whole time and that

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,300
no weird plug-in updates came up right

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,159
in the middle of it and they're like I

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,350
thought this was new guys ever get that

00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,360
some plug-in needs to be updated eight

00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,190
minutes before training and they're like

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,600
no that was new what do we need updates

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:05,280
already like because it's WordPress

00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,600
because developers don't have anything

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,740
to do with their time

00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,630
so we're just adding stuff all right

00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:18,110
that's all my tips any questions before

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,110
I move on to Gutenberg Gutenberg yes sir

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,540
post I always tell people this is

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,670
anything you're gonna update so

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,650
basically if you got news feed a blog

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,510
you know these are these are the things

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,190
you're gonna update a lot of people have

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,530
kitschy names for their blogs now

00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,020
because we can't call them blogs anymore

00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,460
too much Pinterest for that but posts

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,620
are things that are updating custom post

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,260
types or data sets this is anything that

00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,510
I've got a spreadsheet on our intranet

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,240
stored in that I need to display on the

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:57,630
website you know this happens in the way

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,510
of attorney profiles physician profiles

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,130
you know the locations this is a great

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,740
thing to use a custom post type for

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,510
because we don't want them to choose how

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,910
locations display especially if they

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,830
have maps involved you know because if

00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,450
you've used Google Maps in the last year

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,760
you know they keep trying to trick you

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,930
into doing different API stuff we don't

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
want them to control that we want to

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:22,350
control that we want to be standardized

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,600
so those are data sets other questions

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,860
before I move on and we'll have plenty

00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,860
of time for other questions I think

00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:41,640
Gutenberg Gutenberg fans Bueller nobody

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,500
yes yeah when you first put this slide

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,080
in as a developer you're like Who am I

00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,890
about to piss off in the development

00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,910
community but thank you so in that the

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,650
reason it says a my never-ending

00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:57,780
struggle with page builders and editors

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:59,670
I love to hate things like this I love

00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,940
to love Gutenberg for what it could be I

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:05,970
love to hate Gutenberg for what we don't

00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,250
know what is yet you know it's it's hard

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,690
to use right because the default for

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,000
people that have a wordpress website

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,940
existing right now is to say here's a

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,860
new thing let me go do it what's the

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,420
problem with that how many of you have

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,520
been like me and in the last year you've

00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,570
dealt with clients that self host

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,869
they came to me and said well I

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,550
installed the new WordPress and it seems

00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:29,940
that none of my pages are working

00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:31,140
anymore well yeah you know did you go

00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,700
rip the engine out of your car this

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,640
morning just jam a new one in it and

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:38,130
think was gonna start up no that'd be

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,110
stupid but we do this with websites

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,450
right why because they're fickle and we

00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,980
think that they're gonna be fine but I

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,680
think Gutenberg is going to get better

00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,960
and I think that developers who support

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,970
the community and users that want to

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,710
start testing for the community and

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,200
doing the right thing with helping us

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,869
out with what to know are gonna make

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,280
Guttenberg a great thing so a couple of

00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,050
things I want to say about Guttenberg

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,300
there's basically three things you need

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,190
to think about and I'm so glad there's

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,890
somebody from Pantheon in here right now

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:13,350
because I totally ripped these off of

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:14,820
you and I did because they're so true

00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,130
and it's what a lot of developers are

00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,720
saying but first thing you need to do if

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,520
you're gonna use Guttenberg or want to

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,220
use Guttenberg and you already have a

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,010
website now this is not for people that

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,020
are booting up a fresh website WordPress

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,430
install this is not for you this is for

00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,010
people that have had a website for a

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,560
couple three five years and you want to

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,119
decide to use Guttenberg number one

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,000
prepare all right

00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,500
don't hit the button yet because you got

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,660
to think about what Gutenberg is going

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,240
to do there are a lot of hosting

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,330
companies now that have staging websites

00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,190
built into your hosting learn how to use

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,260
that or find a developer that can help

00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,380
you with it staging website will save

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,880
your life when it comes to Gutenberg and

00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,520
possibly rebuilding your entire website

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,359
or having to find some sort of backup to

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,359
restore what you've done

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,570
design I'm not a designer so when I

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,859
first saw Gutenberg I'm like this could

00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,740
be really good and it could be really

00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,410
pretty and it could do functional great

00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,869
things but not without design right

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,280
because if you use it by default how

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,510
many of you have tried to jam it into

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,990
your template and then all you had a

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,190
bunch of funky margins everywhere right

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,920
Gutenberg is actually out of the box

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:32,190
designed very beautifully you know what

00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,320
your template your theme is not designed

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,170
around Gutenberg

00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,300
Beauty it's not it's designed for the

00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,310
old visual editor so there's a lot of

00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,200
gutter there's a lot of margin there's a

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,840
lot of things you don't need inside

00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,720
there so make sure you're designing and

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,860
this is the most important one extend

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,500
anybody tells you that what I'm saying

00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,490
is not true it's crazy Gutenberg is

00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:01,790
painfully easy to extend painfully easy

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:04,430
to extend it's basic JavaScript right

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,980
it's not very hard you can learn it if

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,380
you want to do something really crazy

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,750
with it you're gonna need to do some

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,050
serious tinkering but if you want to do

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:18,590
something simple it's pretty easy case

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:20,300
in point this is the default way you

00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,670
would put your plugin in if you want to

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,560
add your own blocks to some theme now

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,300
this is very rudimentary this is not the

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,600
way I do it for our themes but this is

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,800
the way you could add it to your own and

00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,480
then this is JavaScript that just

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,550
creates a little simple box that you can

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,860
change the color background on all right

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,650
this is very simple code this is stuff

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,040
you can learn in an afternoon Gutenberg

00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,930
is painfully simple to learn you just

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,260
have to spend time with it and you have

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:52,900
to understand that by way of extending

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:56,540
it you can break things so unit tests

00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,400
staging websites and making sure that

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,430
you've designed this well are gonna be

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,080
pertinent to making it work like I said

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,090
I don't think Gutenberg's a bad thing I

00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,340
think that if you want to use Gutenberg

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,230
you should definitely try it out boot it

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,850
up on some test sites some staging sites

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,320
somewhere and play with it if you

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,630
haven't played with Gutenberg and you

00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:19,250
are a wordpress developer time's

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:22,160
a-wastin it's it's coming around visual

00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:26,350
composer people in here beaver builder

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:30,580
hey we got a we got a couple beavers

00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:33,800
page builders are great WordPress's

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:36,950
evolutionary scheme and the future of

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,630
WordPress is not going to support a lot

00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,250
of out-of-the-box things like that

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,710
you're gonna have to get things that

00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,570
update Gutenberg is a is a good way to

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,310
go it's a good way to go because the

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,240
community is working on it and people

00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,340
that care about

00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,410
WordPress are working on it we're not

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,180
selling it to you so at the end of the

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,560
day we want to we want to develop for

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,730
you we want to extend it but we also

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,119
just want to make it good just make it

00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,220
good

00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,960
so if you haven't thought about it and

00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,080
developers if you're not contributing to

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,900
it now's a good time I am uncomfortably

00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,970
stepping into the waters to learn about

00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,500
it and deal with it right now we had a

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,360
long talk about this over a few beers

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,150
last night because I love to hate

00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,420
Gutenberg because I started using it in

00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,580
its beta format and I was like hell you

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,640
guys trying to do to me right now this

00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,450
isn't okay but it can be a great thing

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,450
if we make it a great thing

00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,950
questions

00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,080
mmm for a good reason

00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,180
yes yes you are correct

00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:49,630
I would I would also argue that theme

00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:56,950
COEs X theme cornerstone page builder is

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:59,850
pretty close and however page builders

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:04,830
that force you to do things that are

00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:07,690
semantically incorrect hurt my feelings

00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,850
so there's a couple of things with those

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,380
page builders when you drag and drop an

00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,180
element into it at pre borders pre

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,740
margins and pre box shadows things I

00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,820
don't think those are things you need to

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,490
do

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,110
however for if you are building your own

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,820
website these are great tools to use

00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:27,730
there are syntactically and semantically

00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:30,400
that can cause you load speed issues as

00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,619
WordPress updates and as your theme

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,470
updates can cause you made major page

00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:40,300
layout issues so no I didn't mention it

00:43:37,470 --> 00:44:00,730
not that I don't like yes sir this

00:43:40,300 --> 00:44:03,359
question is gonna suck we're about to

00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,359
find the street

00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:34,250
yeah definitely so the question was

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:35,750
around decluttering the admin interface

00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,060
and making it simpler

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,650
are there any simple recommendations for

00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,350
that now I also do that a very custom

00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,440
way but there's actually a plug-in

00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:47,360
called WP admin menu customizer that

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,220
basically writes all the code that I

00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,950
would write anyway just a little less

00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,230
functional there's some things in it

00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,580
that semantically I don't love but it

00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,580
doesn't matter it's the admin screen I'm

00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:01,910
not worried about load time here but WP

00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:03,650
admin menu customizer allows you to drag

00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,770
and drop and hide things in the backend

00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:09,530
it also allows you to give functional

00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:12,320
names to things so if you've got a user

00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,630
that really doesn't get it you can

00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,520
change the name of pretty much any item

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,140
in the backend so if they don't know

00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,090
what a post is you could actually write

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,590
it out to say this is the place where

00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,740
you put the things that update the

00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,540
website there's like oh but yeah that's

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:30,190
what I you would use if I wasn't doing

00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,190
it by code good question

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,930
other questions

00:45:54,109 --> 00:46:01,349
I'm gonna answer that in a very broad

00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:06,990
way yeah backups I would recommend daily

00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:10,230
backups but I do not hesitate to give

00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:12,029
clients admin access cuz anytime you try

00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,279
to control somebody's access they will

00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:16,770
try to do more anytime you give them

00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:19,160
full access they will do less you notice

00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:22,980
people don't steal stuff from open gates

00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,319
they hop fences right so you give people

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,950
a bunch of access and it terrifies them

00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,569
it's you know it's kind of the way of

00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,089
the world it's the way we socially act

00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:35,339
so yeah give them give them access give

00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:37,289
them wide open access and force them

00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:40,020
into a hosting plan or recommend a great

00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:41,910
hosting plan that has daily backups cuz

00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,190
it's not likely that they're editing the

00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,390
website every two hours anyway and what

00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,049
we want to do is give them a way to go

00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:51,440
back all the time we do daily backups to

00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:54,059
the cloud it's it's cheap it's cheap

00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:05,119
there's a storage space it's not what it

00:46:54,059 --> 00:47:05,119
was in the late 90s other questions

00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,200
perfect well someone else has been

00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,270
applauded so it must be my time to leave

00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,130
a couple of things there are some great

00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,900
talks going on this afternoon and

00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,339
tomorrow definitely go check them out if

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,930
you are interested in Gutenberg

definitely go check out meissner's talk

00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,339

out because I'm super interested in also

00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:31,380
heckling him while he's doing his talk

00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,609
