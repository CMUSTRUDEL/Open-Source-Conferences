I personally been a web business owner

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,799
since 1995 yes there was a web back then

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,450
there wasn't much of it but that's when

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,210
I built and sold my first web site way

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,920
back in 1995 and I've been a business

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,439
coach for WordPress freelancers since

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,930
back in 2014 that's one of my favorite

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,970
things I do is help WordPress business

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,229
owners blow up the obstacles that are in

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,640
their way of growth and help them to

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,030
grow their businesses one of the most

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
important features or topics that we

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,229
deal with is what we're talking about

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,850
today which is productivity I wrote a

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,619
book earlier this year called dealing of

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,070
problem clients actually gave that talk

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,020
here at work camp Asheville back in 2016

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,340
last time I was here so I turned that

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,829
talk into a book it's a lot of fun it's

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:47,579
on Amazon out there let's see so when it

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,290
comes to this subject I'm an expert by

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,540
the definition of dr. Niels Bohr who

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,180
says an expert is a person who has found

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,520
out by his own painful experiences all

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,670
of the mistakes that one can make in a

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,110
very narrow field that is me everything

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,390
I share with you today is simply I

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,420
wasn't born with it I made all the

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,160
mistakes and so my job today is to help

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,030
you avoid the mistakes that I made and

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,860
give you a workable system to grow your

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,140
business even if

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,030
you were busy now I like to start these

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,520
kind of talks with a slide that's

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:25,560
something like this you are not alone

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,390
you come to an event like this by the

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,410
way how many of you are freelancers you

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,240
own a business you work with clients

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,120
should you okay awesome you're my you're

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,640
my tribe it's easy to come to event like

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,670
this mixing with in rubbing shoulders

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,490
with people who do what we do and feel

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,709
like everybody else in the room but me

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:48,530
has it together how many of you have it

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,150
all together

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,489
Joey has it together all right talk to

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,190
him afterwards he's gonna speak next

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,450
informally in the hall okay it's easy to

00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,880
think you're the only one who has

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,239
struggles but here's what I've learned

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,959
over hundreds listen hundreds of

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,370
conversations at word camps in coaching

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,070
situations and face to face

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,220
conversations I've learned that many

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,410
people in the WordPress space are one

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,860
more bad client away from calling it

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,049
quits they are one more bad month away

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,540
from throwing in the towel and it's a

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,269
shame because most of those frustrations

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,480
and problems are solvable with great

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,610
systems and processes and one of the the

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,519
most common things that leads to that

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,540
feeling of angst is what we're going to

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,570
talk about today which is overwhelm how

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,860
many of you are currently overwhelmed

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,489
yeah how many have you been there in the

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,420
last 12 months yeah okay by the way

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,220
listen if you are struggling in this

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,830
area or in any other area of your

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,350
business I drove from Birmingham to

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,930
Asheville to talk to you and I'm not

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,480
saying that trite ly I'm here for you

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,890
now liquid web and I themes paid the

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,630
money for me to be here they're letting

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,850
me come they cover the expenses and all

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,610
that but I made this trip I'm taking my

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,230
time for you because one of the ways I

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,700
give back to WordPress is by helping

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,700
people who are doing WordPress with

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,650
clients do it better okay so I'm dead

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,970
serious when I say if I'm walking around

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,760
the hall grab me let's talk I'm

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,740
seriously I'm here for you and I think

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,010
the liquid web are making that possible

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,120
so here is

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,650
an overview of what we're gonna talk

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,950
about today the common struggle we all

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,000
face with overwhelm second of all

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,400
understanding that problem and getting

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,280
some terminology around it because when

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,480
we name our problems they become less

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,310
abstract and scary and we can actually

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,020
start to put some solutions around them

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,310
then we're gonna develop a strategy

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,780
that's going to help us become more

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,120
productive and make it actually work and

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,880
then some final suggestions from my own

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,270
practical experience on how to do this

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,430
well okay now by the way let me be

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,350
totally honest and transparent so as

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,630
that definition of expert I showed

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,640
earlier makes a lot of sense and this is

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,110
this it's really funny because I've

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,060
given this talk a few times already this

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,890
year at different word camps I've given

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,450
it online in the freelance lis peer

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,830
group that I'm doing right now with a

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,160
bunch of freelancers from across the

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,710
world and it's it's hysterical because

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,250
this is the one issue that has kicked my

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,640
butt up and down all year long all year

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,200
long and I've actually had to make some

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,850
significant changes in my agency to

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,280
bring some people in to deal with this

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,020
issue of overwhelm so it doesn't matter

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,520
if you don't know anything about

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,020
productivity or if you've given this

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,500
talk at word camps you know a dozen

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,360
times like I have this is a constant

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,710
issue that keeps coming up but the

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,060
strategy I'm gonna give you is one that

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,100
does work when you work it so by the way

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,780
if you are a picture taker or one that

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,080
likes to grab the slides right there

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,430
that link Nathan Ingram comm /wc avielle

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,840
this is the slide I take a picture of

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,540
because it's gonna give you the download

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,550
link for all the slides it is also the

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,730
place that you want to go to to get the

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,500
tool that I'm gonna give you to help to

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,350
manage your productivity better it's a

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,910

course I'm giving it away free today and

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,680
also one more thing I'll just mention is

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,480
that liquid web is awesome in that they

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,980
will give you two free coaching sessions

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,290
with me if you sign up as a partner

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,290
being a partner is free just talk to him

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,790
at the table out there and we can talk

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,960
about productivity or anything else you

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,150
want to talk about in those two sessions

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,760
all right let's talk about the common

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:39,220
struggle strategy versus execution

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,510
execution is what we do strategy is why

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,160
we do it

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,920
we're gonna spend our time today talking

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,810
about these issues and I'm gonna put

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,660
some terminology to this struggle that I

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,830
think we all face every freelancer faces

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,390
at every business owner every web

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,460
developer every blogger everybody

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,680
everybody faces this this is not a

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,730
technical issue this is a human nature

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,070
issue we struggle with this issue

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,590
execution versus strategy now we need

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,840
proficiency in our space we need

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,150
proficiency on the execution a lot of

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,430
the talks here at WordCamp are about the

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,140
execution we got a no word press we got

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,180
to no plugins we got a no security we

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,520
got to know CSS and PHP and JavaScript

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,920
and jQuery and typography and design and

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,710
themes and plugins and all that stuff to

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,870
do the stuff that gives us our work that

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,390
we do we need to know this stuff that's

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,890
the execution it's to what we do the

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,380
strategy though is a little more

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,320
complicated the why we do it we also

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,900
need proficiency in that area this is

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,180
the internal documents and processes the

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,700
marketing of what we do the creation of

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,290
new services personal productivity all

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,330
of the the why and how that we do things

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,430
both of these are critical now here's

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,170
what I've learned along the way most

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,520
people get into the WordPress space

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,920
working with clients because they love

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,300
the execution we get in there we nerd

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,250
out and geek out all over the neat

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,870
technology and the greatest theme and

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,280
the page builders and you know things

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,870
you can do you put the semicolon the

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,790
right place and the PHP works all of a

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,150
sudden and everything's magical happens

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,710
on the web right it's wonderful it is

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,110
inevitable that somebody in that

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,120
situation gets a year 18 months into

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,310
working with clients and boom they hit

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,090
the same walls all the same walls and

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,890
it's all about the strategy you got to

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,180
have the why not just the what so we're

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,680
gonna talk a little bit about that today

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,540
you cannot eliminate it now here's the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,550
challenge we all understand the need for

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,340
strategy we get it I mean none of you

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,260
people are ignorant you understand the

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,450
need for strategy we understand that if

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,430
we organize our businesses and our lives

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,830
in such a way that we can become more

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,380
efficient more effective more productive

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,030
more profitable we get that if you if

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,670
you manage a time well you got more time

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,370
you can do more stuff this is not hard

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,850
to understand the problem is

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:00,820
the doing of the strategy gets really

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,010
complicated doesn't it I mean how many

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,300
of you understand that yes I need to

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:11,010
organize my life to be more productive

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:16,570
how many of us do that well right okay

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:20,680
this is a challenge how's your strategy

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:23,290
today are you steadily improving in your

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,970
business are you steadily improving in

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,240
your productivity or does it look a

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,740
little more like that you're kind of up

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,970
and down backwards and forwards you take

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,490
it you know you go in one direction to

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,500
kind of work your way around for many of

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,470
us we're kind of down in this arrow and

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:42,010
the bottom and by the way this has to do

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,620
with what is it what are the internal

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,620
processes of your business look like you

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,520
know the difference between owning your

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,700
job and owning a business are the

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,900
internal systems and processes in your

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,520
business how much of what you do is

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,240
related to only things that are in your

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,520
head and not on a checklist somewhere

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,920
does your business run on process or

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,150
heroics where you just step in and make

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,930
things happen or is there a process

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,790
behind it

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,800
if you're running your business on

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,500
heroics and not process if you're

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,200
running it on intuition and not

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,940
intention nothing necessarily wrong with

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,700
that but you own your job you are

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,610
self-employed you don't have a business

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,230
and at some point you may want to do

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,140
something different and if you've taken

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,360
the time to build a business and not

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:39,100
just own your job you have something

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,130
sellable at the end of your work that

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,500
makes sense now here's the here's the

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,090
challenge how in the world do I do that

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
when I'm just doing all I can to keep my

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,530
head above water just doing work for

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,560
clients that's the hard part and that's

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,870
all we're gonna talk about today why is

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,190
it so hard to keep this kind of strategy

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,290
in focus we're in a word camp this

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,940
weekend work camps are fantastic I did

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,870
1980s last year I'll do somewhere around

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,000
that many this year

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,860
I love word camps I've been to war camps

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,540
across the country in Canada I'm going

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,550
to Costa Rica in September I'm

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,560
love word camps I'm always learning

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,339
something new the WordPress community is

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
fantastic

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,660
you're gonna leave today probably with a

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,430
firehose of information all these ideas

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,620
all these thoughts all these things and

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,389
you you know a lot of time you we spend

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,040
time reading blog posts we attend

00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,769
webinars I'm doing two or three live

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,000
webinars a week we're reading books

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,399
we're doing all these things we've got

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,550
all these amazing things that we need to

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,670
know you got a list of changes that you

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,069
know you need to make in your world but

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,430
it never seems to get shorter that

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:41,430
sounds familiar

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,639
lots of stuff is added to that list but

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,290
nothing seems to get accomplished what

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,790
are you gonna do with all the awesome

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,800
things that you're gonna learn this

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,089
weekend at WordCamp what happens when

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,980
you get home you might have a bunch of

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,110
great ideas that never get implemented

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,899
and it's not that you didn't have good

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,790
intentions it's that life got in the way

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,709
right I mean how many have you been to

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,630
war camps before you've listened to

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,100
webinars read books read blog post on

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,079
all these things and you've got all

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,639
these thing and nothing ever seems the

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,149
in your list never seems to get shorter

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,440
it's just customer demands came up right

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:20,680
family issues needed your attention and

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,470
three months later no change no ideas

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,660
implemented so I want to put a word to

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,029
this idea that's going to help us to

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:33,779
work to a solution and that word is

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:35,949
whirlwind whirlwind what is this thing

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,959
let's spend a little time understanding

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,060
what we're up against so we can know our

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:44,170
enemy and then develop a strategy to

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,300
deal with it the whirlwind is the energy

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,040
and attention that is needed to run your

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,560
business or do your job or whatever it

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,660
is the energy and attention that is

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,230
needed to run your business the

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,430
whirlwind is the 14 emails from clients

00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,750
waiting on you in the morning with

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,269
demands all of the things that to be

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,250
done by noon the whirlwind is that

00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,019
customer call that happens right as you

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,540
were about to start working on your own

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,660
website for a change that sound familiar

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,990
the whirlwind is that one hour a meeting

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,220
with a client that stretches into three

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,660
you come to your desk in the morning

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,370
with the best of intentions it's gonna

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,070
be day where I finally get to do my

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,810
stuff for a change and then

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,350
you make the mistake of opening your

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,550
email and that idea lasts about 10

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,100
minutes and the rest of the day you're

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,220
spent putting out fires chasing the

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,290
whirlwind

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,630
listen I've spent hours and hours of my

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,130
life and seminars and webinars I've read

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,320
books all full of excellent information

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,310
that could really help my business and I

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,870
never implemented anything at all and it

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,310
wasn't the author's fault it wasn't the

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,290
presenters fault it's just that when I

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,670
got back there were emails to answer in

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,100
clients to call in a hundred other

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,720
things I could do in a day this is the

00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,110
whirlwind or like somebody mentioned as

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,590
we were talking at the beginning here

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,670
sometimes the whirlwind is me getting

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,340
captivated by some new piece of

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,740
technology that came along and I end up

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,360
spending an afternoon on something that

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,970
doesn't really move the yardsticks in my

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,350
business at all and I've wasted four or

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,850
five hours doing it I'm sure none of you

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,790
have that problem I'm just saying for me

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:28,020
you know sometimes this can happen all

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:32,620
right so the whirlwind is the urgent

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,450
things that have to be done now here's

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,090
the problem with the whirlwind goals and

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,950
strategy are important we got that we

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,390
understand they're important we know we

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,300
need to do them but the whirlwind is

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,760
urgent Franklin Covey company says when

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,910
urgency and importance clash look at it

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,460
urgency wins every time and it does

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,340
doesn't it think about it our practical

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,320
experience bears that out urgency wins

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,850
every time we know we ought to be

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,890
rebuilding our own website we know we

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,300
ought to be really kind of brushing off

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,250
our contract and doing better with that

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,450
we know we ought to be doing lots of

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,370
different things but urgency wins every

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,830
time those things are important the

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,510
whirlwind is the urgent so what do we

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:20,760
say we'll do it tomorrow we'll do it

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:23,920
next week we'll do it next quarter

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,900
problem is delaying strategy doesn't

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,770
work because the whirlwind never goes

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:32,290
away it never goes away the lesson we

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,930
never seem to learn is when I when I say

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,300
I'll do this tomorrow I'll do it

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,540
next week I'll do it after I launch this

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,120
project we forget one very important

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,060
thing guess what's going to be waiting

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,279
for us tomorrow next week next quarter

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,220
after the next website launches what's

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:55,050
waiting for us the whirlwind it's still

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:59,709
there if it's not there we got a problem

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,540
by the whirlwind isn't bad it just is

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,610
what it is the whirlwind is your

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,040
business it's your work if there was no

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,520
whirlwind there'd be no paycheck are you

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,770
with me

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,600
so the whirlwind isn't bad don't

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,529
disparage the whirlwind you just got to

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,550
deal with it

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,680
the ruin isn't bad it just is what it is

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:21,880
accept it for what it is it's a fact of

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,130
life of business so we have to accept it

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,810

our businesses forward how do we do

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,930
better and grow personally with the

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,529
reality of the whirlwind in our life

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:40,390

00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:50,490
