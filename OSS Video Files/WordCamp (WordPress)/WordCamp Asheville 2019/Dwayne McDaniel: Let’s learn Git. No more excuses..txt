Title: Dwayne McDaniel: Letâ€™s learn Git. No more excuses.
Publication date: 2019-09-06
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	Whether it is for re-using the same code, experimenting with your code quickly and efficiently, or just for better document management, one of the most important leaps any site builder will ever take in their path towards becoming a developer is learning a version control system, or VCS. Since Git is the standard VCS over 80% of developers, lets roll up our sleeves and dive in. The benefits far outweigh the efforts needed to learn this tooling. Once you start, you will wonder why it took you so long to unleash the power of this awesome tech.
This talk will briefly explore the need for git, the history and use cases. Then we will jump into how to get started and the basic organizational concepts. We will also examine Github, the web based Git hosting service. Bring your laptops to play along at home and get started before you leave the room.
Takeaways:
Basic know how of what git can even do
A history of online collaboration and what that means for Free and Open Source Software projects like WordPress
A path to better collaboration with any developer, or frankly anyone, in the world

	00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,769
first lesson is it's good that's the

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,370
very first thing that's the first thing

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:20,130
isn't it

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:23,810
oh okay was it no I think it just got it

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,529
closer or turn the volume up in the back

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,439
I'll put that down

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,789
I'm suggest this a little bit okay I had

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,380
plenty of time to adjust this before I

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,710
started but no I'm gonna stew it right

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,690
now

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,969
hey everybody as I was introduced I'm

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,520
doing already coming about Pantheon I'll

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,129
get back to that in a second I make

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,840
things I like reading comics and web

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,770
comics and I love karaoke didn't

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,950
fighting to carry with you last night

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,840
but that's alright I'm sure somebody did

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,700
and karaoke happened in the city and

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,199
that makes everything cool the slides

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,870
for this and everything else I do is out

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,340
on mc2 ENCOM I would recommend going

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,680
there and following along in the slides

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,199
if you have a laptop or other machine in

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,550
front of you there are slides that I

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,290
won't be showing today that have

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,489
animated gifts that show exactly what

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,770
all of these commands look like when you

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,659
actually run them so if you get lost you

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,310
can go back and see it as a tutorial and

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,960
play along at home that's the intention

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,729
one of my favorite talks of our books

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,350
I've ever read in my life is you can't

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,990
teach a kid to ride a bike at a seminar

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,090
and true I can't teach you get today I

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,009
can teach you the fundamentals and you

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,180
can walk out with a better understanding

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,829
but until you actually put the stuff in

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,590
motion yeah you're never gonna learn it

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,060
so go does get the slides and I'll give

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,130
you a jumping-off point as a template to

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,750
get going or take many of the many many

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,610
many online classes forget anyway

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,380
quick plug for Pantheon over for company

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,030
called Pantheon we are a platform as a

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,100
service for running your Drupal and

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,540
WordPress websites hosting is definitely

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,880
one of the feats we accomplished but

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,030
scale is our whole game if you need

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,070
scale for your team or for your site's

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,920
you're doing a lot of things talk to us

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,450
we can make your life a lot better but I

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,770
want to know who is in the room who am I

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,850
talking to like there's more people here

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,930
that I thought would be on a Sunday

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,829
morning so thank you very much for

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,790
coming back to word camp Ashville 2019

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:13,480
so who here is a designer awesome who

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,390
here is developer

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,510
awesome by the same same ants and

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,310
anybody project manager in here cool I

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,739
think it's actually super practical for

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,250
for everybody who's content creator

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,959
content editor kind of maker yes I use

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,120
git for all of my content storage needs

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,890
and it makes my life really simple as a

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,269
writer because I can go back and see all

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,950
of the things I've written and why I

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,340
wrote them that way but I'll talk about

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,519
that later

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't we started a little bit late but

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,560
I still want to take like a minute and

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,269
we're at WordCamp and weird camps real

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,980
the real value here is talking to other

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,080
people like the sessions are valuable

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,610
don't get me wrong and that's part of

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,079
why we're here but really if you haven't

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,739
connected with all the other people at

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,360
WordCamp we should do that so this is a

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,069
second look around see somebody you

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,260
don't know and just go introduce

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,620
yourself real quick just like a minute

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,620
tops

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,380
nice to meet you I'm Dwayne where you in

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,490
from Washington

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:33,120
Oh everybody drives in for this special

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:34,830
camp I think all right nice nice all

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,990
right that sounds about good enough but

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,010
thank you for indulging me you can find

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,720
our seats again it will you can you can

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,140
you can find that person later and have

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,940
a full blown conversation with them but

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,990
for the sake of WordPress TV and the

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:56,270
folks at home I'm gonna move on so if I

00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:00,390
could get us back everybody

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,930
I've lost the crowd this happens

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,300
sometimes

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,600
all right everybody let's get going get

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,190
all right so why are we talking about

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,720
get today why'd you come in room talk

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,830
about Gillick what the heck are we even

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,820
talking why are we talking about this

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,920
thing if you don't understand the why

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,540
the what doesn't make any sense this

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,310
this happens to everybody eventually

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,020
we're you've renamed a doc thousand

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,900
times and you don't know which final

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,640
final final is the right final this is

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,880
the old-fashioned way of doing version

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,390
control and documents and then we have

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,310
the drop box method who wins who wins

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,720
here

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,430
they both edited the same document and

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,060
they both uploaded them and those are

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,220
the timestamps blue blue wins that's

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,810
correct

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,460
that's a problem because what happens is

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,620
yellows work just gone poof and we've

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,810
all been here there's a white screen of

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,880
death because we edited something we

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,470
shouldn't we pushed something around and

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,980
like oh well that that doesn't work at

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,190
all does it

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,550
who here has ever used the in admin

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,080
editor for anything yeah we all have

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,100
eventually popped it open something I

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,150
just got to put this little thing in

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,950
there I've got these one little thing

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,090
and then it becomes this and then we got

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,990
to figure out what the heck we'd even

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,340
did and ultimately like I use command Z

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,100
almost every time I just one keyboard

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,440
because I can't type that well but this

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,729
is a terrible strategy for like managing

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,740
documents it's a good for tactical

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,639
solution for when you're just typing in

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,830
a text box

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,159
but it's a bad solution overall for

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,150
getting back in time so that's what

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,639
we're talking about we're talking about

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,849
get the version control system if you go

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,800
to Wikipedia it says something like this

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,879
completely completely accurate but it's

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,750
much of gobbledygook if you don't know

00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:49,830
what it means and the manual forget if

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,699
you type man get into any terminal this

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,030
is probably what's going to tell you

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,879
it's the stupid content tracker notice

00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,900
it's not the stupid code tracker it's

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,029
not stupid you know developer tool it's

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,669
a content tool ultimately that's what

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,620
get is so it applies to anything that's

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,080
in a text doc but we'll get back to that

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,490
I always think it's important to see

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,590
where this stuff came from the faces of

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,870
the people who wrote it so we probably

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,699
should all know this guy if use Linux at

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,439
all or use anything that uses Linux like

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,090
everyone in the world does we can think

00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:26,849
- Torvald and the 2005 he said the best

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,759
decision I have made in my entire career

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:33,270
is putting unio in charge of the project

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,759
of get this guy to this day maintains

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,900
the gate repository on github or all the

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
other gear repositories this is the

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,089
master key holder forget really funny

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,659
guy if you go like Rita's pull requests

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:47,039
they're actually very entertaining and

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:48,690
what they had the problem was and why

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,639
they work together to make get it wasn't

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,789
just some idea they hooked up they were

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,250
building Linux literally inventing it

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:59,069
and said there's over a thousand people

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,560
around the world who need some way to

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,270
access this code and communicate with

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,500
each other about how we are interacting

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,509
and building this code and they borrowed

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,729
the old IBM term knowledge worker which

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,039
I think I BM coined in the 70 or the 60s

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,900
I think it's the earliest record I can

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,500
find of knowledge workers neck in this

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:24,419
context I said knowledge workers do

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,860
things they modify objects over time so

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,289
what we're really talking about is a

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,120
knowledge worker creating a document

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,639
saving a document editing that document

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,759
saving it again keeping track of every

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,560
time they've modified that document

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,620
including an explanation of what they

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,620
did

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,930
so you in the future know exactly what

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,580
you did more importantly other people in

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,320
the project without having to dig

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,990
through lines of code can quickly

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,180
summarize what have we done here why why

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,560
did we do that thing but really we're

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,880
not talking about single tech stocks if

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,680
we were only talking about single tech

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,960
stocks at a time it probably wouldn't

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,720
exist but who's ever looked at the

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,460
internals of their operating system like

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,010
just cracked it open and we're curious

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,630
like just started digging through files

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,520
it's fun your machines are yours like

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,920
the part of the beauty open-source

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,140
that's why I embrace Linux I used Mac

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,720
for work stuff but I'm brace Linux the

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,210
rest of my life because it's ours like

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,680
literally it's our code we can go do

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,530
anything we want with it and looking

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,180
through it is kind of a fun thing to do

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,890
there's so many files there are so many

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,560
files and what do they do and it's not

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,210
just Linux WordPress there's so many

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,250
files and WordPress so we're talking

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,990
about whole projects at a time giant

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,150
sweeping changes and folder after folder

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,510
after folder and we create these

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:44,200
projects we save them we edit them and

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,540
we save them again and that's why I get

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,300
came into existence as you understand

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,380
this picture then you probably get

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,540
everything I'm going to talk about today

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,040
and you probably don't need to be here

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,430
unless you just want to talk about

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,570
commands themselves and I won't want to

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,510
leave you with the impression that this

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,920
is how git works then individual

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,820
commands in your fingertips as you leave

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:10,140
the room today and this yes might sound

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,590
a little funny but here is an actual

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:18,460
actual chart forget git is graphical

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:22,980
based it's node based there's these

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,980
concepts of these balls on a timeline

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,040
and once you wrap your head around that

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,800
notion and it might not make any sense

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,960
to you right now but start using it like

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,010
wow that's how I get history works that

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,350
is this crazy chain and branching and

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:42,940
alternate timelines and going back in

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:48,490
time in all reality these look a lot

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:51,010
alike so very important to all of this

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,510
that feels like a weird segue but got to

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,710
remember everything with git is local

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,380
it's a stupid content

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,900
tracker it knows other versions of

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,460
itself can exist but it thinks it's the

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,550
only one and thinks its most important

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,740
one in the entire world wherever it is

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,770
get instance on your machine and get

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,620
instance on a computer you don't own

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:14,140
called github or bitbucket or on another

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,290
machine somewhere else in the world from

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,380
its point of view it thinks it's local

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,510
and it's the only one that really

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,440
matters it's kind of important thing to

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,540
remember here and it took me a while to

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,540
grab my head around that one but again a

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,750
fundamental concept it's important it's

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,180
also super lightweight if you change a

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,730
10 Meg file change two characters in it

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,220
and you SFTP that across the wire

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,430
how many Meg's do you have to move when

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,300
you edit that file 10 Meg's that's

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,480
correct if you change two characters and

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:52,360
move that same file changes over get how

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,010
many characters do you have to move two

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,770
characters and a little bit of metadata

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,570
around it so not even close to what

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,860
you'd have to move otherwise super

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,470
lightweight it's not a backup tool it

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,420
kind of is for your code it can double

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,380
as a backup system for your code it's

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,550
not intended to be well I put this in

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,660
here specifically to remind people

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,980
because a lot of people they hear about

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,300
this like oh that's awesome

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,400
I got everything backed up I don't have

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,420
to worry about backups anymore we're not

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,830
talking about your database we're not

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,200
talking about your media files we are

00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:27,460
talking about your code when we talk

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,170
about git in context of WordPress but

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,120
get is a nice backup tool if all you do

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,730
is text files but we'll come back to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,180
that later but it's not intended to be a

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,530
backup tool that's a side-effect and if

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,900
you can point me into a better

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,820
documented thing that exists in relation

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,980
to our space please tell me because I

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,520
can't find one there are more documents

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,930
blogs tutorials guides everything

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,120
written about git then there are any

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,890
other project I've ever seen in my life

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,630
it's this important I think we should

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,970
honestly be teaching it to grade school

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,830
kids as a better library system it just

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,180
it just makes sense to knowledge like

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,270
start version controlling their

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,070
knowledge bases so how do we do this

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,570
this is where the tutorial part kicks in

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,540
so if you have a machine open

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,430
you already have if you're on Linux or a

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,550
Mac you probably already have get there

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:19,090
if you don't you're on Windows there's

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,620
this beautiful thing called get bash

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,080
which is what we'll be going through

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,910
today I am gonna focus on the command

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,260
line version of everything cuz that's

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,960
how it was written that's what it was

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,670
intended to do it's gonna be a bunch of

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:36,160
commands that you Telegraph to your

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:38,950
computer and it does a thing but there

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,540
are ton of GUI tools out there these are

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,400
just the first four they got named when

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,920
I was making the slide there are others

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,020
and I used to be kind of against them

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,370
like you got to do what the command line

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,050
way it makes more sense to do it that

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,720
way but I've been thoroughly convinced

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,280
recently that's not the case these tools

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,870
exist for a reason and they've evolved

00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,340
right along right along with git and you

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,680
can see visually things a little bit

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,180
cleaner and clean up some problems that

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,030
have like logic layers of how it deals

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,350
with like conflicts and whatnot so if

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,610
you want to start with a GUI start with

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,810
a GUI if you want to start with command

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,370
line start with the command line either

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,730
way you got to get get on your machine

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:18,760
before you can do anything else so I'm

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,250
gonna walk through a bunch of commands

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,080
now and if you have these slides at home

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,640
pulled up I've hidden every other slide

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,110
but there's a animated gif that shows

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,880
like what does this actually look like

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,100
running and how it might look like your

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,620
machine if you wanted to copy exactly

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,170
what I did so the first thing we're

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,060
gonna do is an it an it says let's go

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,960
ahead and create a git repository in

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,610
this folder you can have as many git

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,870
repositories on your machine as you want

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:52,360
just one get file for a folder and what

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,860
a get folder actually is to demystify

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,950
the whole thing it is basically just a

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,340
bunch of bash commands that make folders

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,720
and move files around with like there's

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,700
one special little part that makes these

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,140
things called hashes well other than

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,180
that you can completely manually

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,800
recreate get if you wanted to you

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,570
probably don't want to but you probably

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,460
you absolutely could there's nothing

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,750
that's magic special here it's a dot

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,459
folder so it means tinton but that get

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,429
if you're brand new to all of this

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,929
off ls- a will show you all of your

00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,509
hidden folders when you're in a command

00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,459
line situation or if you're on a Mac or

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,139
PC just find the option show hidden

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,749
folders there's a lot of hidden folders

00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,490
in there but inside of here I'm not

00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,819
gonna dig into all the internals there's

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,959
thing called head head just tells you

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:46,389
where we are where is this reality

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,399
everything else is kind of storing all

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,619
the changes over time and the meadow

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,809
around those changes there's a proper

00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:55,119
naming system all this or tree and nodes

00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,529
and branches I'm not gonna get any of

00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,879
that today it's kinds a little confusing

00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,079
when you first learn it when you learn

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,939
digging the internals later it becomes

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:07,240
important but get in its the first thing

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:08,170
we have to say hey exist get and then

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,480
it's like alright I'll start paying

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,899
attention now and then there's this

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,399
thing called get status get status is

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,319
the safest thing in the world to run if

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,899
you're ever confused and lost just get

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,399
status and it says his this is how I

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,679
think the world looks right now and

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,569
we'll say hey I you'd haven't handed me

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,220
commits made to me but there's all these

00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:29,379
files I can see but I don't know what to

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,910
do with them they're just they're there

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,379
what do you want me to do again gets

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,209
stupid it needs you to tell it so we're

00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:40,600
gonna do this little dance called good

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:45,059
add git commit so far again we're only

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:48,129
ever working locally it's a good add

00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:50,290
puts things kind of in a file folder and

00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:53,589
get commit puts us in a file cabinet so

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,769
if I was to should I've got a file

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:58,360
folder if I was to say if we take a

00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,709
digital representation of everything up

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,749
here imagine this is like digital and

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:05,019
not real I can say all right this is the

00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:06,809
state of this stuff right now I want to

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,490
put this as is this version of reality

00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,559
in a file folder and I say okay we're

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,059
gonna take a snapshot of this stuff but

00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,549
it's not a snapshot it's actually the

00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:18,279
stuff where that's a good add we're

00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:22,360
gonna get add everything you can add dot

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,709
and then I say all right

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,319
I want to remember this stuff so I put a

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,290
time stands like I 921 I had the cup

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,899
under the projector and initial commit

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,649
great put that in the file cabinet that

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,209
is done that is in there for

00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,310
bring get rid of it if we really really

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,709
want to but that's there and now I come

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,769
along later and I move that around and

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:46,139
move this up here and do one of those

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,060
actually I'll probably catch fire I'll

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,970
do one of those move this a little bit

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,790
and I put my phone up here now I could

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,829
say alright get add or save all this and

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,630
then get add and now if stuff this

00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:59,880
representation of the world into a new

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,639
folder and I write on the outside of it

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,250
I move the coffee cup move the mic stand

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,839
move my phone that's good enough for my

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,970
notes for the future write down the

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,030
outside put that in the file cabinet

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:16,199
then I do it again make some movements

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,179
do the thing ad nauseam keep taking

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,370
those snapshots of the representational

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,189
state of the world putting them in a

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:26,400
file folder writing on the outside and

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,900
that's my commit putting that in so as

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,850
you can guess I have this file folder

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,650
full of these files of these commits I

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,580
can go back and look at them and

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,250
eventually go back in time with them but

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,409
I'll get to that so when we add a file

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,990
what we do is we're adding it to the

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,059
staging area of get it gets like alright

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,530
I know now that you want me to pay

00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,720
attention to this thing and I can see

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,580
what version it is right now put in that

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,950
file folder so you can say individual

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,179
file names more complex projects you're

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,010
working on this is actually the safest

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,380
best way to do it but if you're really

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,169
really lazy or you know I'm just gonna

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,690
trust everything I did was correct get

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,809
add dot that is a magical thing in bash

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,990
it's the self referential dot it says

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:11,760
here like get add everything in this

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,940
folder and everything related to this

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,460
folder underneath it it's a kind of

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,409
magical special character called dot if

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,650
you ever see you on a command line it's

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:24,809
like CD dot dot that just means the

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,400
directory above me so like two special

00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:32,070
magical characters in bash I love anyway

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,990
then when we write our commit message we

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,309
can throw a dash M flag in the command

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,480
line and say alright here's my message

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,159
if you're using a GUI there'll just be a

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,130
box and just write your commit messages

00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,659
in there and does the same thing on the

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,710
command line though if you don't type

00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,820
the dash M flag then you get dropped

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,400
into the

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,850
fault editor and on most systems that is

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,700
set to VI or vem if you're lucky it will

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,710
be set to nano or Pico but most time

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,530
we're going to be in VI the number one

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,750
thing googled on Stack Overflow Google

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:06,900
found on Stack Overflow is how to quit

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,880
them not kidding because it's an archaic

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,090
weird system when you first encounter it

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,740
like you have to type a I to insert to

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,520
type your message escape to get back to

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,240
the command the level of it then : WQ to

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,150
write quit which on the surface like wow

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,620
that is convoluted as heck but if you

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,160
want to go to a world where your fingers

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,020
never have to leave the keyboard ever

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,940
learn them it's actually really fun and

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,370
it will if you can touch type it will

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,360
improve your efficiency like

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,520
dramatically like almost immediately you

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,960
can make it do anything this is a

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,570
technology that's been around for thirty

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,640
years that's only ever gotten better and

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,290
only improved it's convoluted to use at

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,050
first but if you want to memorize 100

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,120
hotkeys it's better than sublime text or

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,080
visual studio I am convinced of this

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,710
because you are in the code anyway

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,540
enough preaching about them well once

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,060
we've got the steps down of ADD and

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,310
repeat we just do this over and over and

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:10,200
over and over again and honestly this is

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:13,080
90% of get usage this is 90% of how I

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,530
use get is good ad get commit and

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,450
another step we'll get to later what

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,300
this does this gives us this ability to

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,970
look back in time and see get log so we

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,970
can see exactly what we have done in

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,570
this repository and that stupid long

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:34,050
number there that commit hash that's the

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,170
magic of get and I don't like we should

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:40,470
overlook this the likelihood that this

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:44,880
number will ever be repeated is 1 in 3

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:47,700
billion never in the wild has there ever

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,630
been two commits the same to commit

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,930
hashes the same

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,150
especially not on a single project it

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,980
was forced in a lab one time they like

00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,080
they figured out a way to cause a

00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,940
conflict to happen there but that was an

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,530
artificial situation like it's kind of

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,000
this magical algorithm that happened

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:08,160
based on the contents of the thing

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,190
you're doing she's kind of cool the get

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,950
logs are a lot of information guys who

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,620
think I'll get log one line which just

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,030
spits out a quick list so there's a

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,510
little small one but I'm gonna go live

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,190
code this thing and I'm gonna do a get

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,870
hey it's that so I didn't I've typed it

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,420
out but it's get log one line and here

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,490
is the actual history for this project

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,750
idea call Kevin Thal calm the buddy of

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,360
mine in the drupal world that I run this

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,340
website and here's the actual things we

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,670
have done with the site so at a glance I

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,820
can see like oh okay we did that okay oh

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:45,800
alright I see who did that okay this is

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,800
a very very quick glance of the world

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,560
you can also see what have I changed

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,880
like alright I'm working and alright

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,100
I've made a bunch of changes his file

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,480
I've been working here with twenty

00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,310
minutes and I keep it and saved but I

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,760
don't I don't know where I started what

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:05,700
was the last time I committed uh-oh

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,950
well gets there again get diff this is

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,310
the basic use of get def get get diff as

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,050
a bunch of uses but the basic one is

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:16,650
where am i what have I done what has

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,420
changed and one of the cool interesting

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,920
things on get is git doesn't do

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,000
individual character so I kind of lied

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,760
earlier when I say you change two

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,980
characters it changes lines it

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,620
understands lines of things but if you

00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,780
change the character on a line it thinks

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,600
you destroyed the entire line so that's

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,300
why you have a negative red like red is

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,310
this is the second line and then down

00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,580
below it's the exact same thing I just

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,890
added a space of above or a carriage

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,510
return above it's like alright there's a

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,380
whole new line you can race that line so

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:53,010
it's keeping track of things very

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,070
fine-grained and all that stuff at the

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,320
top it's actually important to get

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,630
itself and it's things if on a very very

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,670
advanced uses you can actually use that

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,880
information in very effective ways to

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,830
get back in time and modify things but

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,320
that's moving forward in time again if

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,960
you understand that of like I'm taking a

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,149
representational state adding it's like

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,210
get pay attention to this and then get

00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:23,339
like save it long-term that is 90% of

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:24,960
getting as far as just pure usage but

00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:27,989
what makes get exceptionally powerful is

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,779
this ability that we can go back in time

00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:34,460
the same way we went forward in time

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:37,259
literally there's thing called revert

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,349
where you can just step back through all

00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,659
of your commits and say unravel what you

00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,769
did if you know anything about knitting

00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,179
or crocheting it's literally just

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,359
pulling the thread back out and you just

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,499
go back in time a step very safe to do

00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,109
because you're just undoing the thing

00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:53,309
you last did so there's not gonna be any

00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,759
conflicts with that it's pretty cool

00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:58,649
pretty safe you can revert to any of the

00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,950
any of these ideas so when we're

00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:04,259
reverting what we revert is the actual

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,269
ID and the short ID versus the long ID

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,899
it doesn't care it knows they're both

00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:09,419
the same thing

00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:13,409
so this ID maps to the other longer ID

00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:16,139
and it's all fine so here I have said

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:19,080
get revert this one and there sure

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:22,289
enough what happened is I got a brand

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,879
new commit that happened that reverted

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,309
the last set of changes but that last

00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:29,969
set of changes are still sitting there

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:31,409
so there is eevee eevee b89 five and

00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,739
there it is but there's a new commit

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:37,889
ahead of it because you're still going

00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:39,419
forward in time even though from the

00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:42,749
code functionality perspective you've

00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:44,519
taken a step back this gets kind of

00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,659
stupid like doesn't want to go back in

00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,719
time it's like all right I'm gonna keep

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,249
adding things and you can keep tracking

00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:54,089
and go back to anything you can even

00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:55,379
revert revert which happens sometimes

00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,669
like well you know what that revert

00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:58,769
didn't actually fix the problem I guess

00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,509
that bug was somewhere else let's just

00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,580
revert that revert kind of looks funny

00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,369
in your history but it's a safe way to

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,129
do it because again a revert is just a

00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:11,009
commit but there's this other thing

00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:13,919
called get reset and you throw the flag

00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,200
hard and it's like all right I'm gonna

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,889
forget everything after you told me that

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,139
point in time so I get revert to eb DD

00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,669
there we go so these other changes ahead

00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:26,969
where I reverted my revert but that

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,750
looks stupid in my it might help get

00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,669
history later so I don't really

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,820
I reverted revert so let's get reset

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:37,990
hard and pretend those didn't ever

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:41,679
happen now we're too worrying about this

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:45,120
this is super dangerous if you get hard

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,350
or get reset hard to the wrong point

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,480
there's ways to get out of it but it's

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,250
convoluted and you've kind of hosed

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,450
yourself and if you're working on a

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,000
project to other people they're gonna

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,850
hate you if you've done this cuz that's

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,500
gonna mess up their get logs so revert

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,900
very safe and it was gonna get Mattia

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,610
for reverting get reset hard should be a

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,900
discussion with your team I'm gonna do

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,480
this and everyone's like okay we're good

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,450
with that then you do that for working

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,820
by yourself do whatever you want that's

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,270
forward and back in time get ad get

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,880
commit and get revert three commands not

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,980
that much get status get log those are

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,559
informational good to know not that many

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,289
commands yet but then we get you like

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,309
the real superpower of get and why this

00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:32,320
will change your life as a developer

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:34,299
this concept of I'm gonna create an

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,789
entire parallel universe based on what's

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,679
here now and anything I do in that

00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:44,200
parallel universe does not affect my

00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:45,580
master reality until I want it to and if

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't ever want it to it doesn't have

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:53,169
to you can have as many branches as you

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,700
possibly want I have one Drupal repo

00:26:53,169 --> 00:27:00,010
with 6,000 or 6868 branches because I

00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,710
installed every module there's another

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,090
project there's no limit to it and you

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,650
can play in these as much as you like

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,090
and then when you're done you just merge

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,590
those back together and say all right I

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,720
want this reality to not become this

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,500
reality timeline so the word master here

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,490
is convenient but it's arbitrary like

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,289
that's just what your first like reality

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,090
of git is it just happens to be called

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:24,039
they could have called it like reality

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,919
one it's been the same thing in fact you

00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,390
could rename it if you want so there's

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,980
no like master/slave relationship here

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,700
is just like mashers default what they

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,200
called the original baseline reality so

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,280
you can say git branch and get branch

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
will just tell you where you are it's

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,789
like all right here's the branch as I

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,780
see there's a bunch of flags for this

00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:42,490
and if you're working with online

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,929
repositories you can look at remote

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,130
posit ori branches without having to

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,890
pull them down but we'll get to that

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,179
later but to make a new branch you just

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,350
say get branch and then name the new

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,800
branch and it's like alright there's a

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,210
new branch now get set up to do this out

00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,650
of the box and then once you move over

00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,200
to that branch you just get check out

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:01,510
and check out this very powerful feature

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,380
and in who here has ever worked like in

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:08,230
the SVN world or any other centrally

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,480
controlled version control system so

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,500
good I'm not gonna have to unlearn y'all

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,750
on this one

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,610
I wonder desk in firsts like threw me

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,580
off when I first encountered it get

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,179
check out says hey get move the head

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:24,280
what we're working on over here and

00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,260
let's pay attention are not patient

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:32,140
let's pretend like this is all of

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:34,780
reality now in this branch this doesn't

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,730
just affect what it's trying to track

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,510
this affects everything so when you

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,280
check out all of your text Doc's will

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,950
magically transform into whatever is in

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,260
that branch so if my branch like I have

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,120
deleted a plug-in and I'm working there

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,570
and I go back to master branch and that

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,150
plugins still there just it's almost

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,850
Auto magical that all of that just

00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,470
transforms for you you don't have to

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,700
like save anything or do anything

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,860
special you're just like checking out

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,600
this new reality you can do this all day

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,070
so if you want to test out a plug-in

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,970
make a new branch throw that plug-in

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,740
just in that branch

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,780
test the heck out of it doesn't work

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,190
let's flush it we don't need to care

00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:20,890
about this if it works that's merge it

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:23,620
back in alright yep James you bring out

00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,230
the branch working in you do the exact

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,350
same steps you get add get commit and it

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,700
has its own game log and eventually you

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,250
merge that back in so that's a point

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:37,420
there and to merge you just say hey

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,040
merge this but where you're merging from

00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,010
first you got to make sure you're in the

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,809
branch where you want to merge into

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:47,280
because again everything would get is

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:50,620
local from gets point of view it doesn't

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:54,790
it doesn't want to pull push things it

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,070
doesn't want to it doesn't want to move

00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,450
things around

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,250
outside of it it wants to say if things

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,450
moved into it or move like push away

00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:07,960
from itself so go back to like check out

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,060
master and then merge branch that you

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:19,990
want to merge into master from there and

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:21,040
it works good yep yes that's it so if

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,170
you want to merge things back into

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,560
master you check on a master but merge

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:31,150
works both ways so if I this is a

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,880
classic with with updates so repress

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,870
that org has released a core update

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,570
meanwhile I'm working on a new theme

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:41,830
that I'm like custom demon over in a

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:45,180
branch I apply the main apply the update

00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,890
to my master branch get that production

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,330
then I go back jump back into my branch

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,470
that I'm working in for my new my new

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,320
fee and let's call it new themed branch

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,850
and I get merged master for my new

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,080
themed branch and it pulls that change

00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,170
over so I can make sure that those

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,680
updates aren't gonna break my theme work

00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:04,960
very powerful you can do this in less

00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,430
than 10 seconds like this is a very fast

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,010
operation forget it's like okay now I'm

00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:11,710
good I can do this really quick really

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,860
lightweight so you have infinite number

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,890
of test machines on your machine now

00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:19,090
congratulations with almost zero setup

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:24,910
if you're working locally this just

00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:27,190
works but you will run into the sad

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,410
trombones of the get world eventually

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,120
and there's no way I can tell you to

00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,190
prevent it where you'll hit a merge

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,910
conflict and a merge conflict is where

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:40,480
the same document or documents have

00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:42,760
changed in both places you changed it in

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,850
master and you changed it in this branch

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,590
and again get is the stupid content

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,900
tracker it doesn't know what you meant

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:54,100
it's like one of these is probably right

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,660
but I'm just gonna fail now but it's not

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,430
gonna completely fail get merge will

00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,690
actually get to a state where it's like

00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,100
I'm gonna keep trying to merge this

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,610
thing and now I'm in this funky state

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:06,370
you need to fix and all you really need

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,930
to do to fix it is go and find all of

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,430
those Murr are those conflicts and it

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,510
will do this to your text

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,510
because again we're just talking with

00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,280
Texas files so here's like okay this is

00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,220
what you said in master and here's what

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,680
you said a new branch what is it and

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:30,190
then once we fix it to be our liking

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:31,840
what do we do we save what no we like

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,130
we're back in like we're trying to fix

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,600
this in master and there's a merge

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,610
conflict that's happened we fixed the

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,050
text document like okay this all looks

00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:43,270
right to me now get we save get add git

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:46,240
commit and we go back we just right back

00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:47,710
to that forward march when in doubt

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,570
you're probably gonna do a git status

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,450
and then probably get out and get commit

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,590
like that solves a whole world of

00:32:52,450 --> 00:33:00,580
problems for you there's also a bunch of

00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,600
tools that do will help you out with

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,880
this stuff but here's like a quick

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,870
example like here's me literally editing

00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,160
that text files like alright here's

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,429
here's what I really want it to be now

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:13,030
git add git commit fix I merge conflicts

00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,510
and there I'm good to go get status is

00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,630
clean

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,210
we're all happy again you watch that on

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,320
your screen will look a little better

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,420
but there are tons of tools that will

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,860
help with this in fact this is one of

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,990
the arguments for using a GUI GUI have

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,840
this can have built in logic layers that

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,370
can assist with this out-of-the-box

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,809
source tree is my favorite it's like I

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,130
will crack open source tree if I hit a

00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:38,500
merge conflict that I can't figure out

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,020
cuz it will like show me visually things

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,960
that I can't conceptualism my head that

00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,030
easily and will actually help me find

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,740
all the merge conflicts but there's all

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,390
sorts of tools if you just type git

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,400
merge tool it will say you don't have

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,840
any of these installed by default which

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,250
one would you like to use and then once

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,870
you pick one it will like throw you into

00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,160
that tool which is will just take you

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:02,080
right to the conflicts and like fix it

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:05,530
in text everything up to this point has

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,909
all been on your machine 100% local now

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,850
we're gonna talk about get repos or

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,919
repositories on machines you don't own

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,720
but guess what it's just get there's a

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,790
fancy UI on top of it don't get me wrong

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,560
like all these people have done amazing

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,410
things github is the classic the first

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,300
to bat but get labs or see

00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,590
i CDE is pretty darn awesome there's a

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,340
reason the Drupal projects went with

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:33,190
them as their collaboration hub but

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,750
buckets got some advantages as well not

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,430
going to say one over the other they all

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,620
but they're all implementations of get

00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:40,090
online I'm gonna show github because

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,980
it's the most common and I think

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:46,540
everyone needs to get hub account but

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,460
this is just the same as you want to get

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:53,140
logged locally just it looks a little

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,450
different the model is very very simple

00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,730
once you start viewing it only from

00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,230
everything's local and I'm basing my

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,020
point of view inside of one of these

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,400
bubbles because you're pushing away from

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:07,870
yourself and you're pulling into

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,470
yourself so if we look at your

00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,090
repository you get pushed to a remote

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:17,170
but from the remotes perspective it's

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:20,170
pulling the code into it from my

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,490
repository origin I am pushing and then

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,130
on my colleagues machine they're gonna

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:27,220
pull that content from I pull that code

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:30,730
or whatever those files from origin into

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,950
their machine you pull into the repo you

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,520
push away from the repo and if you

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,830
always view it from the point of view of

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,320
you know one of these points of view it

00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:44,590
makes a lot more sense it's like alright

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,960
I am on github I need to pull something

00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:54,250
into here I'm on my local machine I want

00:35:46,960 --> 00:36:01,660
to push it to another machine what yeah

00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:03,790
ah good question thank you very much for

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,230
that so when you create a github

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,320
repository which is like I'm gonna say

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,270
I'm getting to but great question just

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,440
the same as your master reality just

00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:17,050
happens to be called master your first

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:21,850
remote repository your first remote like

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:24,220
the yeah let me get the next slide and

00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:27,430
then makes it your first remote is just

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:32,380
happens to be called origin so when you

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:33,790
make a remote repository on github it

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,170
will give you like all these options of

00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,490
things to do so you're creating a new

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,029
repository and you're either going to

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,159
build

00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:41,380
from there on github or you're gonna do

00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:45,269
this probably exit push an existing

00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:48,029
repository from your local old machine

00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:50,769
would say already I'm gonna add a remote

00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:53,199
git remote is like here's a machine

00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:55,329
that's not this machine where there's a

00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,039
clone of this repository that I need you

00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,719
to be connected with and tell me if

00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,890
you're in sync because git might be

00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,439
stupid but it can tell you if it's

00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,969
identical to its twin and if it's not

00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:06,249
identical it's like I'm not identical

00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:08,140
anymore and it can tell you like yeah

00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:09,279
we're out of sync I'm this many I see

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,489
this many commits ahead that I don't

00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:13,689
have locally what should we do or not I

00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:17,319
can wanted to ask you all to sit there

00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:19,179
but saying alright get remote and the

00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,579
first remote just happens to be called

00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:23,229
origin there's no rule to that you can

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,559
call your remotes whatever you want to

00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:27,939
call them but the first one just happens

00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,069
to be called origins so in this model

00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:31,959
yeah that's that just happens to be the

00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:33,969
first get hub repository we made for

00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:46,900
this so in the first place we want to

00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:49,059
push yep literally LAN if I have the

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:53,199
address of his machine on a network get

00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:54,999
don't care there's like no computer a

00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,400
computer be however we Network them

00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:58,839
together get don't care it just knows I

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,619
got a remote here and I have an address

00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,459
that realizes is over here I can

00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:08,880
conceptually connect these two things

00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:08,880
now what

00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:18,289
it depends on the project remember this

00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,630
invented github was like long in the

00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:26,059
future like this was invented on local

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:32,180
machines that are on land networks so or

00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:34,220
around the world yeah yeah yeah yeah I

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,140
mean this get it's so lightweight it

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:42,410
would work on an old BBS like we're just

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:46,400
moving Delta's around yeah and then

00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:49,009
there's these concepts of git push so

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,599
you can push to the origin and we push

00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:53,329
we have to pick what branch we're

00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,589
pushing because we can push any over

00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:57,619
branches anywhere so you can store all

00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,180
of your branches online or work with

00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:00,589
them that way and then pass like hey I'm

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,359
doing this experimental branch while you

00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:04,009
pull down that branch from github its

00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:06,289
eyes are pretty common phrase and when

00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,729
you're working I'm testing out a couple

00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:09,589
things internally to Pantheon and

00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,180
terminus and that's how we're doing it

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:14,979
it's like okay go grab this branch and

00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:17,420
go test that out those are that works

00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:19,039
you can have as many remotes as you want

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,989
you have a thousand remotes if you want

00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,910
I don't know the use case for that a lot

00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:24,799
of people do a remote like I have things

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,150
where they'll push things to Pantheon

00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:32,499
and also store it in github for long

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,499
term storage no question yeah

00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:43,599
No it adds the branch locally then you

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:48,430
can check out that branch so you're

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:51,070
getting a clone of that branch yeah it's

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,869
the same repository it's just a branch

00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,609
on that repository when you clone down

00:39:52,869 --> 00:40:01,030
you automatically clone down master

00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:02,890
I actually got too clone yet yeah I'll

00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:06,790
just jump to clone now just take a time

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:08,380
to so clone most people don't just add

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,930
remote repositories and that's not how

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,030
they work with remotes most people work

00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,060
with remote by default because that came

00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,380
with where they got the code from

00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:22,180
there's a concept of git clone that does

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:25,330
all a bunch of stuff for you yeah a

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:27,640
bunch of stuff for you so you can say

00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,680
all right initialize this here copy

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,190
everything down and set the remote to be

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,260
where you got it from by default you

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,270
just get master with that but you can

00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,980
say hey get go pull this branch as well

00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,420
and then it's just like you made that

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,099
branch locally it doesn't know the

00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,690
difference and then it's just get

00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,050
checkout and you're in that branch the

00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,580
same way to be if you created it locally

00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:52,300
all right jump back here real quick so I

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:54,280
can get push locally so I'll chain make

00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,630
some changes pushing up to github I can

00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,580
also edit on github or someone else

00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:00,720
could have edited this file pushed it

00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,950
back to github and then I would need to

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,630
want the wrong direction then I would

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,030
need to pull that information back down

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,630
technically a fetch affection update but

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,280
I'm gonna need two semantics with here

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,680
if you say git pull it will say hey go

00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,320
make this true versus what I see over

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,670
there again you could get a merge

00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,130
conflict from this could be like hey

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,609
something's wrong here depending on how

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,900
you've been working with that repository

00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,369
but well then I've get statuses and

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,670
enough quick code reviews should be good

00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:34,390
to go and then the same thing we just

00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:37,780
push push pull all day long get cloned

00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:39,670
though I already talked about this is

00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,990
the most common way people use github I

00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,730
was like I'm gonna get cloned this down

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,980
simply at some point you will run into a

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,480
situation your life like oh there's code

00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,070
for that on github just go pull it down

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,690
eventually someone will say something

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,210
like that to you this is what they mean

00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,550
let's go run the git clone command throw

00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:57,910
it into your local and then get to work

00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,800
you can optionally name the thing so get

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,320
clone the address of that github

00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,119
repository and then WPC lite demo is

00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,160
just what I called that folder so what

00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,359
clone it into that folder they can

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,540
change into that folder and see what's

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:14,140
going on there's that demo folder it's

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,859
me and that gives us up to the last

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,980
important section which is pull requests

00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:22,560
pour requests are concepts you actually

00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:26,260
already know we already covered these

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,050
it's a branch and a merge but there's a

00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,150
conversation in the middle of hey why do

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:35,710
you want to do this that's all it is

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,190
branching and merging again we're just

00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,359
using git on a machine you don't own

00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,190
unless you do own it you can run your

00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:45,730
own get instance out there in the cloud

00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,470
it's cool but you have to be the person

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,640
who runs it

00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,920
github gives us this ability of a

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,319
repository owner first you can actually

00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,329
say this goes in here you can have

00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:56,680
multiple owners but that's why it's very

00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:59,050
very important to have people that are

00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,500
like core committers who can actually

00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,670
make changes officially to a thing

00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,589
everybody can make suggestions we can

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,140
all go right now on our computers and

00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:09,579
make a suggestion to WordPress core say

00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,930
here's what we think we should have it

00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:13,150
here's a patch that we think should be

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,170
applied to WordPress core well there's

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,700
only a handful of people in the world

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,460
they can say yeah that's a good idea

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,680
so that's person over here a person in

00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:27,520
green like they're the repository owner

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:30,160
everybody can push up to a branch to the

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,960
repository I'm gonna there's more

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,780
complicated than that just pushing but

00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,400
you can open a pull request for the new

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,230
branch and say hey check out this branch

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,579
check out this code in this branch and

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,380
if it's cool then you merge it with

00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:43,450
master on your end that's called a pull

00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,010
request github has a very very very

00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,349
slick interface for this so does get lab

00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:49,390
so it's bitbucket make it very very easy

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:50,920
you can do this all with command line as

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,990
well but I'm not gonna bother getting

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:57,970
into that world way easier with the GUI

00:43:52,990 --> 00:44:01,770
is on this one that's it yeah if you

00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,770
this is 16 or 12

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,829
sixty sixteen commands you're right no

00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:10,469
can remember like this list of commands

00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:12,839
this is honestly 95 percent of what I've

00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:14,849
ever seen get used for it there are a

00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:16,949
bunch of other crazy awesome tools with

00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:18,859
it called like get bisect where it will

00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:21,059
help you track down where a bug emerged

00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:22,529
get cherry pick where you can like

00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:24,539
really mess up your repository and then

00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:27,089
say now I'm just gonna cherry pick off

00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,499
of these other areas like what's reality

00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:33,089
and then we're gonna say alright get

00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:34,289
this is reality now go forward but those

00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:37,799
are only get into situations where

00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:39,209
you've done something more advanced the

00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:42,719
vast majority of time all you're

00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:47,089
probably gonna do is get clone get add

00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,089
git commit and get push origin master

00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:53,249
those four commands are literally 99.9

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,799
percent of what I personally ever do

00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:58,979
with git for everything else in the

00:44:55,799 --> 00:45:00,329
world just go to DuckDuckGo I'm not even

00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,880
saying it for the privacy concern

00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:05,039
reasons but if you if you look up

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,809
anything get related on Google you're

00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,789
gonna get Stack Overflow from 2012 from

00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:10,589
the way the indexing works just the

00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:14,910
truth not that that anything wrong with

00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:16,799
that get hasn't changed same get a find

00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,019
DuckDuckGo actually gets me to the

00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:20,519
documentation and actually relevant

00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,150
current information just faster I don't

00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:26,309
know why but it does

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,229
thousands and thousands of resources out

00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:31,259
in the world for you how to get started

00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:32,999
guides full-on tutorials where you can

00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:36,449
learn in the command line of get from

00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:39,349
the browser and things like that but

00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:39,349
that's it

00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,470
[Applause]

00:45:42,810 --> 00:46:13,420
thank you I'm doing

00:45:44,470 --> 00:46:15,850
we got questioned sure the short answer

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:20,560
is what makes sense for you both are

00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:23,110
completely valid options but some people

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,520
would argue that just doing the the

00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,990
custom work you're doing is the best

00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,850
thing the only version control that

00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:31,840
because why would you version control

00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:33,580
core I'm showing you literally this is

00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,620
my blog there's my website and see doing

00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:38,830
that con we can get the the slides for

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,370
this this is the entire wordpress

00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,870
install because I'm on Pantheon and we

00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:47,260
version control your code automatically

00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:50,050
and as an artifact of that we do version

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,810
control all of WordPress so there's no

00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:57,040
harm in this there's no I think great

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,430
benefit to it either what you probably

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,550
actually want to do is go to a world of

00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,280
Composer

00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,050
where you tell composer go grab all the

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,540
off-the-shelf parts like WordPress core

00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,040
and I'll only worry about these two

00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,330
folders little over here and I can't

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,570
even tell composer to go grab those

00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:15,060
folders when you're compiling the thing

00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:18,070
but that's a completely separate subject

00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:21,490
but like what but this is my version

00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:25,180
control here it's like a get log this is

00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:28,420
how I have hander any plugins is still

00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,250
hard this is what I've actually done to

00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,710
my site I can see when I things are

00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,050
updated and yeah this is get lag one

00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:38,830
line but I could go just quit and get

00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,900
git log and here's everything I've ever

00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:47,770
done like here's a patch to the mark

00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:49,570
mark down if I to continue to yeah but

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,560
this is like literally a you real world

00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,359
use cases how I manage my blog I

00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,510
cheese didn't get pushes up when I'm

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,510
done

00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:08,030
right question yeah it's repo

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:10,510
I'll get repose forget repo get repo is

00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,510
I doesn't matter

00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,440
there is a way to commit to command-line

00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,840
create github repos but I don't know

00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,820
what it is but it's in the docs like it

00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,940
you can do it it's in the github Docs

00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:43,210
specifically yeah you need to get up CLI

00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:45,100
to pull that off but the far easier path

00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:49,090
that works reliably is just go creation

00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,410
on github first yeah that's it that just

00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,840
follow the directions there it's like

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,850
two steps and it's just it's way

00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:14,530
reliable but there is a command-line way

00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:16,990
I just don't know what it is no that's

00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:23,920
wow that's a great great question

00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:25,600
committing WP config so I do so I I'm

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,690
happy to show anybody my WP config

00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:34,680
actually lets cat it config because Oh

00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:37,060
fig that PHP because I want Pantheon and

00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:43,930
like all of our server variables are

00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:45,160
hidden so like so yeah this is yeah DB

00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,510
name user name they're all picked up

00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,190
from the server so if you're doing it

00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,250
this way and you're using a token system

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:52,120
ya committed all day because who cares

00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,620
unless you don't want people to see your

00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,620
redirects which they're gonna hit anyway

00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,970
yes

00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,060
yes thank you thank you I'm so I'll

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,270
sorry so people in here the question

00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,079
should you commit if you're going to

00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:18,130
commit everything

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,720
what about wp-config and general no

00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,700
don't commit wp-config if you're gonna

00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,200
version control everything unless you're

00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,940
using a tokenized system like we have a

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,960
pantheon where it doesn't matter it's

00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,490
just like it's something a server

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,859
variable it's gonna get picked up and

00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,740
then then it doesn't really matter what

00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:33,609
I didn't talk about cuz I think it's

00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,410
it's something you don't really need

00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,700
when you first first first encounter get

00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,550
and that's who this is designed for is

00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,890
done the get ignore file so if I do la I

00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:49,480
would get ignore file and again ignore

00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:52,300
file simply says ignore all of this

00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,650
stuff get don't pay attention if it's a

00:50:52,300 --> 00:51:00,369
dot dmg a dot jar a dot zip do not track

00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:04,839
it if it's an icon which is the thing

00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:06,880
RDS store store hadia store so much like

00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,950
that's completely ignoring like we are

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,140
not gonna track that don't even ask me I

00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,790
don't want you to know so that's good

00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,079
ignore it we'll just let you nor things

00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,819
this becomes very important if you're

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:21,640
doing like complex projects with nested

00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:23,319
get routes our next nested get repos you

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,150
can say alright let's just ignore all of

00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:28,660
those and just be able to ha Tyla

00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,760
highest level like william said here the

00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,369
other better approach is anything that

00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:37,030
you're don't want a version control you

00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:38,619
can move up a level and WordPress and

00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:41,109
most hosts will let you do a thing

00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:43,660
called nested doc root where you're

00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:45,490
actually putting the actual install a

00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,260
level below and something called web or

00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,329
doc root or depends on what server

00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,560
environment you're in most let you call

00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,510
it whatever you want on Pantheon it's

00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:56,349
just called web but you can store things

00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:58,030
in there and then above that is all the

00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:59,290
meta about your site and you can store

00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,869
anything there you want and those would

00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:03,220
be separate repos or the same repo or

00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,660
multiple ways to approach that but

00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,520
that's a good way to do it so I keep

00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,970
that stuff above that you're not pretty

00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,970
controlling

00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:40,400
yeah no sub-modules are not a great idea

00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:44,030
in my general opinion some people will

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,500
argue that and there's that's one of the

00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,880
beautiful parts on computer science is

00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,770
there's not a hundred percent right

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,080
answer to that I would discourage that

00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:53,150
and I would say individual repose for

00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,520
every app that you're running it's just

00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:00,440
gonna be cleaner and a much smaller repo

00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:05,060
it when I say get is lightweight it is

00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:09,320
but if the repos like 668 Meg it's still

00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:10,849
68 Meg yeah exactly but there's no like

00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,570
100 percent right I could tell you well

00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:14,900
you might have an idea though there you

00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,730
go

00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:23,359
agree with William William said don'tyou

00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:25,310
sub-modules I get stashes gotten me into

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,869
trouble more than it saved me I'll be

00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,400
honest with you so git has this ability

00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:30,230
called get stash which just says

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,960
anything we got committed are not

00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,000
committed anything we got staged or any

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,609
changes we can see that's just ignore

00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,520
them for now and let's me do like get

00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:43,520
out of like any weird state I'm in

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:46,130
temporarily so the the best use case

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,330
I've ever seen forget stash is update

00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,070
rolled out and this is a

00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:50,420
mission-critical like security flaw

00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:53,180
update we got to get to production

00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,800
everybody gets stash right now make sure

00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,109
your stuffs clean we're gonna push this

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,400
production alright now we can unstack

00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:01,520
and kill right back where you left off

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:05,060
and hope nothing broke I have forgotten

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,890
to son stash personally enough times

00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,690
that it's burned me that I like other

00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,310
alternative routes to stashing but

00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,330
stashing is a powerful tool if you're

00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,580
working locally it's actually super

00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,990
handy but don't forget to unstack or

00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,410
you'll end up with more problems than

00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,410
you started with

00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:26,550
yeah that's it like you're you're

00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,830
telling it you're literally telling it

00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,540
hey stop working for a second so we can

00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,970
just get around this was one issue

00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:51,000
so get stash is powerful but use it at

00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:54,030
your discretion yeah yeah absolutely

00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,500
that that is a proper way to use it and

00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,840
I'm not gonna argue against that just I

00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,760
burned myself enough trying that that I

00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,590
don't even fit that's personal

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,110
everyone's gonna have different opinion

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:09,990
I think that's it anyway time for maybe

00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:25,410
one more but no all right one more and

00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:27,150
they won't know a lot get is just a

00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,610
hidden folder so there is no danger in

00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,100
doing it that way but why you wouldn't

00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:34,950
just use like get lab or github or

00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,310
bitbucket is like that would be more the

00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,310
question

00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,190
you

00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,630
I mean if you're if you're just like

00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,460
locally getting into that machine and

00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:54,050
getting to the actual file like I don't

00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,280
I don't see a problem with that like I

00:55:54,050 --> 00:56:06,079
don't never seen that actually in

00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:07,819
practice but like you gotta get lab cool

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,960
we get labs awesome because the CIC do

00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:11,030
your under system but that's a whole

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,260
other conversation all right that is it

00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,720
folks thank you very much for coming

00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,760
again I was Duane you get the slides

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,270
