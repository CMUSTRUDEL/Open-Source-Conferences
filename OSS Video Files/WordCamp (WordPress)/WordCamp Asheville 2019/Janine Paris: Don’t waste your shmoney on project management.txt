Title: Janine Paris: Don’t waste your shmoney on project management
Publication date: 2019-09-06
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	Project management at its best removes obstacles to doing great work by helping clients and teams collaborate effectively and providing great data for business decisions. At its worst, it’s a complex administrative system for reporting statuses on failed or failing projects.
It’s tempting to try to fix bad project management situations with software, since that’s what we make for other people-websites, plugins, blocks, or themes that solve various business problems. Before you spend that hard-earned cash on expensive software, though, let’s talk about some less spendy ways to provide value and focus on what we’re really here to do.
Takeaways:
Understand what you, your boss, and/or your team need from you before investing in software or other tools.
Tools for task management, process automation, invoicing and budget tracking, and project management.
How to learn from bad practices and bad data.

I'm Janine I am a project manager at

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,870
big-name design here in Nashville I've

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,170
been at big boom for about two years and

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,359
it's my first project management gig I'm

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,109
really excited to be here with you guys

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,060
today

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:29,699
I was a newish PM because I know we all

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,340
struggle with the same things at pretty

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,430
much every level project based work is

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,469
hard getting projects to be good and not

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,309
bad is tough enough that my job exists

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:47,280
we are a small team of eight all local

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:49,379
so most of us wear different hats some

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,960
of us are remote or have different

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,780
office schedules so it's a fairly

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,410
complex management predicament but

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,530
easier in a lot of ways we all have some

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,260
sympathy for each other I think a

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,439
broader grasp of what everyone does and

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,979
a better sense of what we each don't

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,380
know I think because we've all had our

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,200
hands on all these different problems at

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,259
different times and it's lucky for me

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,100
because folks and other companies admit

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,890
they don't see the value in what I do

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,080
my favorite project management podcast

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,200
the PM happy hour

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,900
recently recapped a survey conducted at

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,020
the PMO symposium which is this big

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,320
conference for big companies talking

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,540
like employees in the thousands that

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,970
have like a dedicated project management

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:54,930
department over half of respondents on

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,969
the survey said that project management

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:04,549
is a roadblock to getting work done or

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:07,439
simply an administrative position and

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,119
given what they found maybe there's some

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,849
truth to that

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,069
another question they asked

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,430
on this survey was about dealing with

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:19,909
fires they wanted to see if there was a

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:24,139
correlation between the maturity of a

00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:26,620
team and the number of fires they dealt

00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,000
with in their day to day project work

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,560
they expected to see this inverse

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,099
relationship align where as a team gets

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,319
more experienced this guy so as a team

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,749
gets more experienced know you're on the

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,200
other side of this so starts here goes

00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:49,419
that way so they expected to see this

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,040
inverse relationship between the

00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,579
experience of a team the maturity of a

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,689
set of processes and the number of fires

00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:02,870
going down you know starting with the

00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,639
least experienced the newest teams the

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,969
most experienced the most developed

00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,459
processes least fires you know that's

00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:12,709
that's that's what they expected but

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:18,379
they didn't find a line they found a

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:21,349
curve so the line started with the least

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,799
experienced and the least develop

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:28,849
processes and dipped for a while and

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,540
then at the other end where you know

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:34,579
where you would expect people to you

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,139
know not have to deal with this they

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:41,150
found the line going way back up so that

00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,280
end of the curve obviously is well out

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,519
of my experience you know team of eight

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,129
like I said but as I try to solve

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,939
problems for my small team I do try to

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:55,729
keep in mind that statistic it's a good

00:03:52,939 --> 00:04:01,069
reminder that it's a it's it's really

00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:03,919
hard to assemble and work as a team with

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,959
clients and deliver great projects on

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:11,750
time for everyone and it's the people

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,500
we're really going to focus on while

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,229
we're connecting these dots between them

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,750
the people the work and the tools we use

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,000
for project management I'm really

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,930
convinced that you don't have to spend a

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,500
lot of money

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:31,580
on project management tools to deliver

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,750
value because what happens when you

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,550
choose bad tools for us small teams we

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,699
are probably sharing tools that have to

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,400
serve our entire team you know it's not

00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,800
like being out of a big enterprise level

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,120
company where your tools are your tools

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,660
and everyone else's tools are their

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,570
tools so we're asking our teams to

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:58,010
interact with our tools like for time

00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,560
tracking or status reporting so in

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:05,060
another survey conducted by a

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,550
professional research company g2 half of

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,130
respondents said they were unhappy with

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,669
the software that they felt forced to

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,039
use at work another 25% admitted that

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,660
they had left or considered leaving

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,729
their jobs just because of those tools

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,520
so now we're not just talking about

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:27,620
project fires or simple team and

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,160
efficiencies we're talking morale

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,800
productivity and turnover which are huge

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,010
expenses for companies so our choices

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,940
here are critical to the success of more

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,940
than just our projects

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:54,039
so where do we start one of the first

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,860
things I did as a brand new project

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:01,240
manager was order some books because

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,610
it's 1897 and I like books one of the

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,180
first books was the project managers

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,460
book of forms I marked nearly every form

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,949
on nearly every page is something we

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:18,220
should do my boss was so excited I typed

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:20,440
up voluminous documents based on those

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,229
forms that nobody understood and that I

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,690
didn't have time to maintain I argued

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,330
pointlessly in meetings for adherence to

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,130
these processes that I had never

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:35,530
actually tried and what I didn't do I

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,979
didn't ask questions I didn't talk to

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:41,979
the team I didn't try to find out how

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,449
they work and think about work and I

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,130
didn't try to find out what tools they

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,320
were interested in using and how those

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,880
might solve some of what I saw as my

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:55,449
problems that I was referring to this

00:06:50,880 --> 00:07:01,750
heavily marked paper real life book to

00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:06,090
solve once I started taking this

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,130
approach of actually talking to people I

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,139
started seeing progress people were

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,840
buying into good ideas contributing good

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:18,570
ideas projects still had problems but

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,919
not always the same problems once I

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,229
started leaning on my strengths and

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,960
thinking about project management as a

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,780
design problem a communication problem a

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,490
people problem I was able to start

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,159
establishing a system that could give me

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,949
the information I need to do my job and

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:38,669
a system that my team can really own and

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:41,620
grow with me and as you will know

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,770
stakeholder buy-in is key to project

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,770
success

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,350
so here's another example I want to tell

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,750
you a few more stories about this point

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,030
that I'm trying to make right so how

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,370
about the time we signed up for a year

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,350
of an SEO reporting dashboard before we

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:05,090
realized we couldn't bring in analytics

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:07,940
data only AdWords I remember using a lot

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:12,470
of exclamation points one telling boomer

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:16,970
my boss there in the back we were good

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:20,630
to pull the trigger and instead of using

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,510
this tool and having more time for

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,180
higher-level work planning strategy

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,310
providing recommendations we chained

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,070
ourselves to an expensive tool that only

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,070
did half of what we needed and we had it

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,200
for an entire year I didn't push the

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,810
team to really dig into this tool before

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,370
we said go I didn't take the time to

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,700
understand the problems that the tool is

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,800
supposed to solve and the nuances of our

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,670
circumstances that affected what we

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,670
needed the tool to do

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,149
and that's where that's where we start

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,660
to come into this this design this

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:09,829
project thinking about what we do as

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,550
project managers let me tell you another

00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:15,949
little story about the before time when

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,570
I wasn't a project manager but managing

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,329
at a small knitting shop that used to be

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,329
outside of salute in North Carolina

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:26,089
there we had a similar ish set of tasks

00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:30,740
to what my big boom team does if you can

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:33,680
believe it we were doing support helping

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:38,180
people with projects and teaching them

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,220
new skills we were conducting projects

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,899
like mostly internal things like

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,680
inventory building displays that kind of

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:48,380
thing and we were doing sales sometimes

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,510
helping make selections and decisions

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,690
but also literally running a register

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,760
because it was a store usually one

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,910
person held the entire operation from

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,339
open to closed one of the least useful

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,339
things we did over and over again every

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:07,510
day was interpret product tags for

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,560
customers meters converted to yardage

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,389
determining yarn thickness from its

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,850
weight fiber content watching

00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,870
instructions young companies all have a

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,160
different way of presenting this

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,600
information and people don't want to

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,279
stand there and take the time to figure

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,940
it out if they can't figure it out they

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:29,930
won't buy the yarn but providing this

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,170
information by me walking over to the

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,800
shelf and reading it off a product tag

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,940
wasn't actually helping sell product and

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,260
it was de railing the prod the

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,940
activities that actually did but it's

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,190
something that people needed people

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,899
needed that information to start making

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,920
the decisions that actually led to those

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:55,610
sales it was my job to provide the

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,170
information but not my only job the

00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,360
tools that used to solve this problem

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,839
weren't exotic and the idea isn't

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,730
original I just made shelf tags with big

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,470
lettering that answered the five most

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,850
commonly asked questions about each

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,149
variety of yarn that

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:14,930
carried I added some color to make them

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:16,610
stand out and people quit asking those

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,370
questions because they could answer them

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:23,300
for themselves they'd come to me with

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:28,459
more complicated questions and actual

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:32,930
ideas by communicating by taking the

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:35,810
time to talk to people take note of the

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,660
types of things we talked about in the

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:42,470
context of those conversations it was

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:46,370
easy to identify basic needs that could

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,139
be addressed with basic tools but what

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,670
do we do when problems and their

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,779
solutions are bigger than what we can

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,019
accomplish on our own because we're

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:56,089
project managers we're not just by

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:58,220
ourselves every day the point is to

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:05,350
coordinate these groups of people and

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:05,350
help them work together and that's where

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:15,500
that's where we have to start talking as

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:18,290
a group and understand how we interact

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,370
as a team what kind of team were on you

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,370
know it was important for me to

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,259
understand the distinction between my

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,439
eight-person team that wore different

00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:30,439
hats every day and a team where maybe

00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,370
they're more fewer people but the roles

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,589
don't really get shared

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,290
you know once once we could start to

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:40,819
talk about those things and understand

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:43,069
them together then the solutions we

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:46,670
could come up with weren't just like

00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:52,089
sign up for the service or find this

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:56,170
tool we could solve our problems by

00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,170
using the things we already had

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,160
so that being said you know tools are

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,839
cool man

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,060
they're out there let's talk about them

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,180
what makes a good tool a good tool makes

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,910
sense to your team they use it as often

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,399
as they need it not having it is more

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,180
expensive than having it it does the

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,329
thing it's supposed to do and a good

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,699
tool usually gets better over time

00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,380
someone whether it's your your people or

00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:37,040
someone else's people are working on it

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,040
to make it better

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,899
so one of my favorite stories about

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:53,490
tools is another story from outside of

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:55,290
my life at big boom and that's that's my

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,630
husband over there looking embarrassed

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,300
so this is gonna be fun

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:03,779
my husband and I have several different

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,329
coffee makers we have an arrow press a

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,579
French press a pour-over carafe and a

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:13,079
couple of in cups trainers what we don't

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:16,440
have is a drip coffee machine we tried

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,779
for years to have a normal 12 cup coffee

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,570
maker but while we can keep a lot of

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:24,690
things clean like it's oats a coffee

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,329
maker isn't one on paper it's not that

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,130
hard I still have a strong feeling that

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:34,410
any adults should be able to maintain

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:37,110
one and it's handy to be able to make a

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:41,970
big hot pot of coffee for sharing or for

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:45,329
storing however this coffee machine for

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,399
us was always always dirty we would both

00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:50,699
avoid it until it reached science

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,529
experiment status we talked about it who

00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:56,160
should be responsible for what when

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:58,800
assignments were made in conversation

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,940
everything seemed doable but in practice

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,519
it was a nightmare

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,220
and it was important to us to resolve

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,160
this we we wanted to feel comfortable

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,480
drinking our coffee and making it for

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,990
other people so finally I bought the

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
Aeropress

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,870
the air over us is almost impossible to

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
not clean

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,760
because it's a couple of tubes and like

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,500
a rubber washer and you push the grounds

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,150
through one tube but with the other tube

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,580
everything gets cleared out just by

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:32,040
using the thing for its purpose and

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,310
that's something that I feel like holds

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,460
an important lesson for project managers

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:42,540
consider the goal is it to do everything

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:46,320
a PM should do and make your team go

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,000
along with what that looks like because

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,610
that's going to be a struggle especially

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,330
if you're at a small company or you're a

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:58,590
new PM if you can state your goal

00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,600
plainly in human terms and relate them

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,030
to the team needs of your team and your

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,090
clients then you'll be better able to

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:09,720
pivot and find the tools that do what

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:17,640
you need them to do that don't get in

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:20,310
the way of achieving the actual goal how

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:27,210
I do have a idea of a photograph of for

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:31,410
this section look at all those tools but

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:34,350
to get back to our PM tools our work as

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:37,500
project managers lots of people use

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,540
Google Drive and Google Docs right you

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,150
probably already do we use it for

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,670
internal file sharing collecting content

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,770
from clients and more and more for

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,830
setting up and sharing a central project

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:52,050
documentation since it records

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,120
individual access and can save named

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,610
versions and you could add your own

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,040
templates in addition to all the other

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,710
cool formatting and sharing stuff it's a

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,200
great option for important project

00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:08,820
documents when we started doing this I

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:10,980
was fresh out of reading the project

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,350
managers book of forms it was digital

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,110
paper I could use as much of it as I

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,660
wanted I tried to get all the way down

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,959
to brass tacks and most coop Docs they

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,180
were 7 to 10 pages long nobody read them

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,700
clients didn't understand them if they

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,870
read them even our team found them

00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,240
completely baffling

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,160
no problems were solved clients don't

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,460
wanted what they wanted questions and

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:40,540
loopholes still existed assumptions were

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:44,559
still made by all communication was not

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:47,640
made easier or better so now a project

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:52,000
scope for most of our projects is a page

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,190
the first paragraph is a summary of the

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,610
client the project goals and the agreed

00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:00,640
approach the rest of the page is a

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:05,440
simple list of what users will and won't

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:09,130
be able to do on the site divided by you

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,080
know user groups or user roles design

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,150
scope gets handled in the estimate and

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,700
then through the project as change

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:20,470
requests there is a second page where I

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,050
can keep running notes on the budget and

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,940
on those change requests and clients can

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,140
see this entire document anytime they

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,050
want but if I hadn't taken advantage of

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,350
the tool I had that was already

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:38,920
available to me and pushed it to provide

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,559
this complicated solution and listen to

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,070
the feedback that I heard and observed

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:47,559
the human behavior around it I wouldn't

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,080
have known how and what to pair back if

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,660
I had left into a complicated software

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,880
solution instead of using the simple

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,440
tool available we might not have had the

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
flexibility to change course when he

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,510
needed to change would have been that

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,000
much harder you know like that SEO

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,000
dashboard we were I was so excited about

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,320
switching gears for a moment still

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:20,890
talking about tools

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,110
who likes reminding people about things

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:27,660
they're supposed to do every week or

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:31,200
heaven forfend every day Oh boomer

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,200
that's why we love you

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,970
[Laughter]

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:43,290
does it make you feel like the office

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:46,810
mommy or pop up well get you a robot and

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:51,280
start automating some of those highly

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:54,370
repetitive reminders I started using a

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,740
site called automate do to handle basics

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,170
like project monitoring since our task

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,190
management software is kind of all or

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:05,080
nothing on the notifications when we

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,290
started formalizing our client support

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,780
system we divided up the week into

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,570
shifts and everybody including myself

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,560
signed up for a couple of hours a day

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:20,380
right so we're supposed to be handing

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,540
off the shifts and communicating about

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,820
you know tasks that are coming in and

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,970
all that good stuff the people are

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,520
people it was a new system people get

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,070
lost in their other work things happen

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,570
shift came and went

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,220
unremarked but nobody wants to be the

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,050
person walking around reminding people

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,660
to take their turn answering email in

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,330
the telephone I didn't want to be that

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,980
person tech sometimes I need reminders

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:51,550
to you guys so I have a little automate

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,010
do bot that checks a calendar and fax

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,740
people right before and at the end of

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,750
their shifts people appreciate the

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,220
reminders shifts are getting covered

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,740
columns are handled work gets done

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,540
automating this releases me from being

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:12,850
the reminder err so I can be a person to

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,760
one of the effects of that kind of

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,980
micromanagement is that people who seem

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,240
to wield power get held up to the

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,740
demands they make by keeping myself

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,630
responsible to the same system as

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,640
everyone else

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:32,770
and using a tool to help keep the system

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:36,220
moving I didn't have to be or pretend to

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:39,039
be perfect when you're trying to solve

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,640
these people problems it's easier if

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,559
you're a person to I know I'm gonna have

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,360
a long pause for a drink of water

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:52,390
how's everybody doing is it a good word

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:59,799
count great so much breathless

00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:03,429
excitement in the room so speaking of

00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:08,740
automation and continuing our discussion

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:11,650
of tools excuse me I can bang out a

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,919
pretty good email I'm not gonna lie but

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,690
it's a pain to type and re-type the same

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,919
things over and over again remember all

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,780
those details that need to be included

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,630
especially for important things like

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,120
project milestones or a team member

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:31,929
handoffs if you're not already using

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:36,159
canned email responses email templates -

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,450
oh man I don't know what like is living

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,770
in the back of my throat now but it's

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:44,250
not good does anybody have any questions

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,250
at the moment

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:53,350
oh that's fantastic

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:55,600
because it's got like it's awesome and

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,340
the free there's like a free level

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:06,309
that's pretty good so you can't like get

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:10,470
in there oh yeah uh yeah I kind of hate

00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:12,940
that here oh really

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:42,490
it's it just seems so much more

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:53,200
straightforward cool yeah yeah yep yep

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:59,850
yep that so helps I feel so much better

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,850
now yeah yeah

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:13,920
that's an excellent question I will say

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,870
I don't have a good tool just for that

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,010
right now

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:22,670
also as a new PM I'm just everybody else

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:28,350
just like shut your ears for a minute I

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:30,120
don't know what that is yeah I was

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,940
asking about utilization so we're

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,950
talking about and like resource

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:41,990
management it's interesting because our

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:44,340
task management software asana has has

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,580
started broadcasting that they have

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,990
workload planning now but I haven't

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:54,320
exploited that yet good question now

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,320
thank you

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,259
maybe it's the wrong time to talk about

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,529
how I'm a power user after admitting

00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:07,259
that I don't know I don't know but I do

00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:10,200
like to really explore the things that

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:13,320
we do use I like to know at least a few

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,779
keyboard shortcuts and all of my desktop

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:21,450
apps I click buttons I look at menus i

00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:22,710
investigate settings panels and maybe

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:28,559
you think that's a little ridiculous

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:31,049
probably you don't cuz you're here but

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,389
tomorrow at the happiness bar come find

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,489
me and I'll show you the pointless cat

00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:39,419
pun keyboard shortcut in asana it's

00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:42,450
great harvest our time tracking and

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:45,269
invoicing software can also record

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:48,659
expenses and automatically include them

00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:51,330
Ellen invoices dates and receipts and

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,830
everything you know who wasn't using

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,600
harvest to automatically invoicing

00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:00,539
expenses us perfect solution right there

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,529
in a tool we were all already using it

00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:06,480
is worth it to spend time was as many of

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:09,119
the tools you and your team are using

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,789
already as you can especially if you're

00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:17,159
thinking about pursuing other tools also

00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:19,850
keep an eye out for blog posts and go

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,679
ahead and sign up for some email updates

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,899
to let you know when new features are

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:30,419
rolling out and how to get or find them

00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:32,100
if they don't then you know you may

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,259
outgrow that service or software

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,570
eventually but you'll have a better

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,799
sense of how far you can push the thing

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,799
that they that you're already using

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:53,680
because this gonna be great WordCamp TV

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,480
okay

00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,970
so we've been we talked about asana

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,250
briefly we've been using asana for I

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,430
think at least five years

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:07,160
it is task management software that's

00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:10,460
recently started evolving to be more of

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:13,460
a project management solution several

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,870
times past big boom managers had tried

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,850
to keep a master client list in asana

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,490
basically a project set up just to list

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,220
out each project or active client there

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,020
there wasn't a way at the time to get

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,680
that kind of information out of a sauna

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:34,790
without either doing this kind of hacky

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,400
thing or like building something outside

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:41,210
that used the API and like pulled

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:46,910
information out of it so this project of

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:49,490
project never really worked partly

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,550
because it was not just active projects

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,520
it was like all clients and those two

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,870
lists projects and clients they they

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,120
should do different things they should

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:06,470
be different things the alternative to

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:10,580
the project of project was to prep a

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:13,910
list for every update meeting which

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,670
takes time and multiple team members and

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,610
turns those meetings into status

00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:23,300
reporting slogs instead of strategy or

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:25,400
problem solving sessions either way I

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,220
made my project status reports they were

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,720
time consuming and siloed data away from

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,270
the rest of the project information and

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,130
the team the only way for my boss to get

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:38,930
this information was to schedule a

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:41,630
meeting and get a list so when our art

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,610
director Sara suggested setting up

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,750
another project of projects in asana

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:51,710
I was like no we've tried that it didn't

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:55,970
work I don't think we should do it but

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:58,220
asana changed since the last time a BBD

00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,350
project manager tried to do something

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,740
like this

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:06,370
and our team had changed so we tried it

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,140
and it's kind of working we update

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,050
project statuses and their individual

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,240
asana projects linked to the latest

00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:18,910
status in the current projects list and

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,830
only list actual projects we use asanas

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,520
built-in custom fields to show things

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,810
like budget status and priority and

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,330
boomer doesn't have to wait half a day

00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:31,380
for updates from all project leads to

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,910
roll in and get come on and get compiled

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,760
wouldn't have happened if we weren't

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:40,510
willing to respond to change and take

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,810
note of how the tools we do use if all

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,880
of an update sometimes it's worth trying

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:52,570
something again when you know that the

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:54,720
paradigm has shifted so I know I already

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,970
talked about a little bit about our

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,050
support work right and we really are

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:05,220
doing a lot to try to make that as easy

00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,220
and awesome as possible

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:16,859
so now that we have this system in place

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:19,919
we've started building some internal

00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:23,279
company tools based around WordPress

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,320
sites or plugins but I like our

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,049
maintenance contract system because it

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,759
was fast easy to build and solves more

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:35,519
than one problem all we did was build a

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,529
gravity form on our site add a plug-in

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,479
that can render submissions as PDFs and

00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:40,879
attaches those PDFs to a notification

00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:44,759
email

00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:46,440
now clients read through our Terms and

00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,929
sign and return agreements at their

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,950
ledger without printing and oh my god

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:56,369
boomer Oh was that swearing oh man

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,239
anyway y'all we're about to be real sad

00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,239
when I ran out of water

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,209
now clients can read through the terms

00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,849
sign and return the agreement at their

00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:12,469
leisure without any printing and

00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:15,570
scamming we're not filing hard copies

00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:17,609
unless we want to our support

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,269
coordinator who's over there in the red

00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:23,909
shirt doesn't have to mess around with

00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:26,609
you know word templates or you know all

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:30,119
those other things we've got a built-in

00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:33,479
list of who signed on and when it's not

00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,329
and it's not it it's not always a great

00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:39,599
idea to try to build your own tools

00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:43,219
anyone who's thought I can make a CRM I

00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:47,729
know how to WordPress knows that it's a

00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:50,309
huge challenge sometimes there are

00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:52,320
reasons to let other experts make

00:31:50,309 --> 00:32:00,570
something and then keep on working on

00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:05,489
that but you can use your expertise as a

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:08,729
p.m. to think about the business case

00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:14,729
right for making a tool that you need if

00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:17,599
the right thing isn't available and DIY

00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,599
it if it makes sense

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:29,919
but I think I not - I think my favorite

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:36,159
project management tool that saying that

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:42,070
I come back to the most is communication

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,820
and I think that to become a good

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,130
communicator

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:49,210
you need to practice right you need to

00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:52,860
talk to your team and listen but also

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:56,020
you know there are ways to learn about

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,120
communication and get better at it by

00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,620
deliberately you know incorporating some

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:05,140
new ideas and thinking about it

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,490
differently so making things happen is a

00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,289
great book if you're new to project

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,480
management or if you want a refresher in

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,940
the basics and it is a project

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,830
management book right but a great deal

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,909
of it is spent talking about how to

00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,740
listen to your team how to you know

00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:23,260
remember to walk around the office and

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,610
see what what people are doing because

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:29,409
sometimes people don't tell you what

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:31,510
problems they're having and it puts

00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:33,720
those communication skills in that

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,940
specific context which is really helpful

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,620
in a more general sense I really enjoy

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:49,360
another book called Crucial

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:51,370
Conversations that has more it's more

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,559
it's it seems a little like a

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:58,059
relationship II kind of self-help ebook

00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:02,159
but since we are kind of in the middle

00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:05,200
right of these things that have great

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,139
meaning and emotional importance and

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,149
business you know importance to all

00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,030
these people you know our bosses our

00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,919
clients our team that's spending all

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:19,210
this effort and making these things we

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:22,629
end up in charged conversations more

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,179
than I think we realize and when we step

00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:27,159
back from that and have some deliberate

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,500
tools like a framework for actually

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,280
approaching that we can

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,770
better manage how we move through those

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:43,720
conversations and get what we need out

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:49,570
of them so we've been talking about

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:52,359
tools for a while now right and we

00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:55,210
talked about some specific some specific

00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,440
specifics talked about automate we've

00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,349
talked about asana we talked about

00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,460
harvest we've talked about you know some

00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:08,109
learning resources some learning tools

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:10,000
basically use the tools that are around

00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:11,670
where you're working keep tools where

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,200
you work

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,750
the tools are probably already where

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,310
you're working you probably just need to

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:31,349
look at what you already have and you

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:35,109
are a tool you're you are a resource for

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:37,750
making things happen as much as any of

00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:46,470
these software tools that you are trying

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:46,470
to employ all right

00:35:46,560 --> 00:36:03,320
so sometimes data is bad and sometimes

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,090
it's bad because the projects were bad

00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,070
it's you know it's it subjective

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:13,230
judgment of performance your performance

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:17,880
the team the clients because they're

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:23,280
also performing but sometimes historical

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:28,950
project data like the information that

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:32,280
is left when a project is done is bad

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,960
because things are missing or you

00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,000
realize that the way the data was

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,940
structured doesn't actually tell you

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,320
much about why a project went well or

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:46,920
poorly and why as project managers we

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,410
deal with both types of bad data and one

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,390
of our functions beyond managing active

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,370
projects is interpreting information

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:58,020
about past projects to make predictions

00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:59,640
about future ones lessons learned you

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:04,020
know after a projects over is really

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,680
helpful it can be much more informative

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,110
to fail them to win bad projects ramp up

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,550
skill sets really quickly because they

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,480
make the gaps in your knowledge really

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,790
obvious but even these these good bad

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,960
projects can still leave you with

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:24,150
actually bad data so what do you do when

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,250
you realize you're dealing with bad data

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:30,930
and not just good or bad projects well

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:34,530
you do the best you can with the

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:37,340
information you have bad data is still a

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:41,100
tool it's a way to see where people

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,770
problems have cropped up and a chance to

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,530
change course forecasting project work

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:49,080
is hugely problematic under the most

00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:52,620
ideal circumstances if you've gotten

00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:55,110
really good at proposals that accurately

00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:58,080
predicts the work the schedule and the

00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,250
actions of the client please let me

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,710
touch the hem of your garment later

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:09,390
peel for your blessing so do the best

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,350
you can with what you have then

00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,660
communicate with your team about the

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:17,830
problems you're seeing in the data and

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,930
the work use those conversations to make

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:23,110
adjustments or changes it sounds simple

00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,490
because it is it's normal to realize

00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,580
that the way you thought something would

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,680
work didn't it's frustrating when it's

00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,130
coming from inside the house but it's

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,960
normal

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:41,590
oh I do have a picture yep he's got some

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,270
bad data it's easier to point to

00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,040
something that's clearly not working and

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,810
convince people that something needs to

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,780
change

00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:51,670
it's really hard to pull up a good idea

00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,370
just out of the blue and get people on

00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,590
board people don't like change and as a

00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,150
new PM you don't always have the street

00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,850
cred to get people on board with new

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,560
strategies without that problem to point

00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,650
back to you and say this is why we're

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,720
doing this thing that we're doing but

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:11,710
when you're dealing with bad data what

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,800
you can't do is be complacent or pin

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,070
blame it is what it is is the death

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,440
knell

00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:22,330
unless it's paired with active plans for

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:25,000
change don't mistake blame for

00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,370
accountability blame is finding a

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,200
scapegoat and a reason why nothing needs

00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:33,130
to change because X Y Z is at fault

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,580
accountability is stepping up and saying

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,040
this can be better here's what I think

00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,170
what I can do what I've already started

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,480
doing what I've asked the team to help

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,480
with that will make it better next time

00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:57,769
in that vein we use harvest for all our

00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,170
time tracking right in harvest there our

00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:03,269
projects which is a way to group track

00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,609
time together for a specific purpose

00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:07,619
sometimes maybe it's just an open

00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:11,039
project that's like for ongoing support

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,829
sometimes it's a harvest project that

00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:20,099
contains the work done on an actual

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:23,930
project and you can set up a collection

00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:28,130
of tasks and rates that get

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:30,930
automatically added to all new projects

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,509
and this is a great way to get

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:36,479
consistent visibility into the division

00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:38,130
of work across multiple similar clients

00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:41,279
or projects right if they all share

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:44,400
these same places where time is being

00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:51,239
recorded then you can go back thank you

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:53,880
and look later at what you have done

00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:58,319
across you know more than one period of

00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,089
of worker time our harvest tasks were a

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,890
hodgepodge of ideas that came from

00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:03,869
different people at different times over

00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,640
the company's history with this tool

00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,670
what should have been the greatest

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,690
source of historical project data was

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:14,729
kind of useless for forecasting when I

00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:19,259
had to produce my first sort of year

00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:21,839
overview of project performance that was

00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:25,229
more or less doable you could you can

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,670
find like budgets and see literally like

00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:29,869
did we meet the budget did we meet the

00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:33,749
schedule all that good stuff but I

00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:39,390
couldn't tell why projects were good or

00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:42,029
bad and that year I couldn't give a

00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:47,579
narrative for how projects had played

00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:50,339
out what I could do was use that

00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:53,160
opportunity to highlight in a tangible

00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,900
way how the data had failed us the human

00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,170
problem underneath it and propose a

00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,170
solution

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:03,250
everything on this project build was

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,500
clark's under the same category as

00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,599
design work because there wasn't a clear

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,880
task set for development no one ever

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,010
asked for clarification or reviewed the

00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,410
entire project tasks outside of asana

00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,910
you know these this was the kind of

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,339
conversation we had to have during that

00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,930
meeting it was not fun but it

00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,940
highlighted the places in the process

00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:25,089
where tackling people problems could

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:31,060
result in better data better reports and

00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:33,400
better proposals and forecasting it took

00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:39,250
us some time to get a good set of

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:41,950
harvest tasks right but eventually being

00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,440
flexible responding to results in a

00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,240
collaborative and thoughtful way

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,310
committing to seeking and making

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,619
tangible changes rather than submitting

00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:55,349
to change by entropy this is a project

00:42:50,619 --> 00:43:02,859
management tool and I've got two minutes

00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:04,839
so what I'm gonna do is say I was

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:07,390
actually pretty surprised by how much I

00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:09,430
enjoy project management all my training

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:13,990
up to two years ago was from making

00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:16,000
things and not managing anything so even

00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:18,010
though I'm up here and normally this is

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,660
the time when people say hoping at the

00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,330
happiness bar if you have any questions

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:26,170
we didn't get to in the session I want

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:28,089
to turn that around we don't have much

00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,640
time here today but I'm checking into

00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:33,400
sick bay tomorrow morning and I would so

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,260
love it if any one of the people in this

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,410
room have been doing this way longer

00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:45,970
than me just come and let me ask you

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:49,180
about what you know so what I'm hoping

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:53,800
aside from you know helping helping me

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:57,660
please help me is that you'll have some

00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,970
things to think about to make your own

00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:04,900
tools work for you without having to

00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:06,890
spend money on new things that maybe

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:11,700
don't pay off

00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,860
and that's it for me i'm janine that's

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,230
my cat have fun the rest of the

00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:26,849
afternoon and an awesome work camp

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:26,849
