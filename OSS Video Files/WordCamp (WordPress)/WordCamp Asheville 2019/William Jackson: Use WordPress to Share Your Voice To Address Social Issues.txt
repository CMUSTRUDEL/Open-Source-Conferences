good now don't put it up because during

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,650
the course of the presentations you're

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,480
gonna take some pictures some little

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,550
video you're gonna be tweeting

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,100
instagramming facebooking whatever your

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,320
social media platform is and probably

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,140
doing a couple of selfies because we're

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,960
gonna talk about your digital content

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,820
and how important it is so as we go

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,420
through the slides we're gonna talk

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,360
about some blogging to everybody in here

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,100
that blogs please raise your hand

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,390
so everybody's hand should go up so

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,000
let's try this again everybody in here

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,800
their blogs but you know cuz blogging is

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
just not the traditional blogging where

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,380
you're typing and sharing words and

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,460
verbage when your computer blogging can

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,520
be video blogging

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,960
it could be podcasting it could be micro

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,150
blogging who knows what micro blogging

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,040
is what is micro blogging okay Facebook

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,040
okay how about Twitter is that included

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,590
as well okay so here's many platforms

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,110
that you can use the blog so it's not

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,030
just one plot what not just one type why

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,610
is that important because everybody in

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,960
here has a voice and sometimes you have

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,520
to share your voice and you're

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,790
passionate about different social issues

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,550
whatever the issues that you have you

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,590
may want to share that issue to create a

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,930
positive change and this is basically

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,690
what this presentation is using your

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,070
voice to create positive change so when

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,270
we're talking about blogging you're

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,820
gonna be sharing your thoughts your

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,570
memories your ideas your skills and your

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,760
abilities so as a teacher my job is to

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,610
empower other people to see the

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,370
awesomeness within themselves so the

00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,220
props are your eyeball hold up your

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,770
eyeball and this is and you are going to

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,260
take this with you this is to remind you

00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,590
that because we are on a digital

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,780
platform or on digital platforms we have

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,660
to remember somebody is always watching

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,550
us somebody always has their eye on us

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,930
and I'm not talking about big brother a

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,670
little brother a big sister little

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,500
sister or the government I'm talking

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,780
about people that we may not have

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,700
physically met but digitally they're

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,520
watching us and I'll give you a prime

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,710
example this is my 32nd year teaching

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,389
in education public education I love it

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,639
it's an awesome career I'm a fourth

00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,169
generation teacher but it blew me away a

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,550
couple of years ago when my fourth and

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,770
fifth graders walked up to me and said

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,900
hey coach I heard you have a YouTube

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,750
channel and I was like yes I do what I'm

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,699
following you on your YouTube channel

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,979
so remember the impact that just hit me

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,360
is like okay you're on fourth grade and

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,590
you're in third grade my first thought

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,930
was what the heck are you doing on

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,120
social media anyway but then kids are on

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,620
social media so not only are they on

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,710
social media but their parents are on

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,490
social media so you use that as a con to

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:03,590
conduit to share positive information so

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,199
if you're watching me on social media on

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,169
YouTube that means I have to empower you

00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,750
with positive information to help you to

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,130
grow and to learn so I like to talk to

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,270
the young people so I was talking to the

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,530
young lady in the back and I'm not

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,419
trying to embarrass or anything and

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,800
there was a young man right there as

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,120
well that we kind of met each other

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,190
yesterday when kind of bumped into each

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,110
other but it's important that young

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,300
people know as well when you're starting

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,680
your life and you're growing and you're

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,240
developing you're trying to figure out

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,370
what you want to do when you grow up and

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,300
some of us are still at that age where

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,039
we're trying to figure out what we want

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,599
to do when you grow up when you're on

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,969
social media and using technology

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,909
somebody's always watching you and it

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:43,300
does have an impact on your life so as

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:46,490
we go through the slides

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,159
here's a couple of pictures that I put

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,219
together in the middle it's the most

00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:55,190
important one I eat and I add a word

00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:58,699
camp having fun hanging out the other

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,069
ones represent individual information as

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,349
well up at the top I have my name of

00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,699
course I haven't eaten my email address

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,889
my Twitter handle so if you want to

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,270
friend me or send me information or and

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,060
request information you're more than

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,930
happy to do that but in the lower left

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,610
hand corner who is that a picture of

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,680
that's a picture of me why is that

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,020
important because the student drew that

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,150
picture because that picture represents

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,729
their thought process of Who I am to

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,500
them so think about the type of content

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,719
or pictures that you put out on social

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,599
media what kind of perception are you

00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:34,580
creating of yourself and/or your

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,580
business so raise your hand if you have

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,320
a business awesome okay raise your hand

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,510
if you're an entrepreneur

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,240
all right raise your hand if you're a

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,640
solopreneur all right so we have all

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,260
these preneur Zout here that's awesome

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,960
all right so we're in some type of

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:55,490
business raise your hand if you have a

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,680
brand who has a brand now when I say

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,150
that and I'm gonna say it again

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,880
everybody needs to raise your hand

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,280
because you all are some type of brand

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,250
so if you go to another word camp or you

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,350
go to a drupal or some other workshop or

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,720
conference and somebody says everybody

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,250
has a brand raise your hand so everybody

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,180
should raise their hand because your

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,130
name is your brand as well there used to

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,310
be a divide where you had your business

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,270
and you had your personal years ago now

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,430
the lines are blurred because your

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,160
actions and reactions and visibility and

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,740
the public also have a reflection on

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,750
your brand and your business so down

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,730
here at the bottom this is my brand my

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,950
quest to teach because I am a teacher

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,020
I love teaching all kind of subjects

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,830
science technology engineering arts and

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,170
mathematics so that represents steam so

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,000
not only do I teach PE I teach steam why

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,100
is that important because young people

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,260
should understand that they can have

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,870
more than one career a lot of young

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,580
people think they can only do one thing

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,280
but with technology you're able to do

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,190
multiple things and a lot of us here we

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,370
do multitask when we're working it in

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,890
our purpose also education on this side

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,670
who is this who is this right here

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:16,220
why poo why poos are all we love while

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,500
poos we love to share why poos we love

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,380
to talk about why poos and that's

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,950
important too because while poos

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:28,700
represent wordpress and word cam who in

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:31,910
here has a logo okay how many of you

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,729
created your own logo how is that

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,510
working for you don't man in about how

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,510
is that working for you

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:45,779
okay all right young lady how's that

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:48,839
working for you okay

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,220
okay all right great so I tell you what

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,709
we're camps are an awesome place to

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,410
network and the reason I said it if you

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:59,529
have a pocket full of business cards

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,529
before word campus over your pocket

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,660
should be empty of your business cards

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,279
and full of other people's business

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,560
cards because this is an awesome

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,390
networking environment so that actually

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,850
happened to work out great so young man

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,370
this young lady is a graphic designer

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,050
young lady he needs somebody to help him

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,100
with his logo so there we did some great

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,279
networking all right

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:25,810
so that's how that works up at the top

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,880
was my first time at WordCamp u.s. I was

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,790
an MC which really worked out really

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,920
cool I was scared and nervous but that

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,220
also means that get out of your comfort

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,550
zone apply to speak apply to volunteer

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,450
do something proactive that allows you

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,970
to grow in your purpose where Camp

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,130
Jacksonville is coming up June 29th and

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,279
30th if you did not know so we're

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,700
looking for volunteers there's still

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,320
opportunities to sponsor word camp I eat

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,490
and I are doing the kids camp so if you

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,110
have kids that really want to get

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,760
involved as well there's still

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,130
opportunities for kids to register for

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,200
kids camp so that way they're involved

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,029
in they're a part of the program so some

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,520
other pictures at the end over there

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,680
that's when we had the word camp using

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,130
the kids camp in Orlando so you're a

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,680
graphical representation of what you're

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,100
doing in the community is very important

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,700
because it builds your brand and it

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,480
helps you address the social issues that

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,459
you are aspiring to make a change or you

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,130
think that something needs to be

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:37,990
transformative leach ange or adapted so

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,089
everybody is important for you to find

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,190
your voice when I say find your voice

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,010
what are you passionate about what do

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,079
you think that there needs to be change

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,449
directed to using the content that you

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,070
create everybody does have a voice

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,620
whether you're on Twitter

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,020
the Graham Facebook tumbler whatever

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,550
platform it is you now have a voice and

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,210
your voice is very powerful

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,800
now particular times during the year

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,380
there are different things going on each

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,130
month so the month of June is what month

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:13,480
is this what does this represent summer

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,310
so you can school's out vacation what if

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:22,140
some what are some social issues that

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:26,400
each month is represented by which one's

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:29,440
September suicide awareness any others

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,280
breast cancer awareness month so there's

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,840
different social issues that you can

00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,250
speak about and the reason I don't

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,750
encourage you to speak about it because

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,440
a lot of people want to get more

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,660
visibility online for their concerns and

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,210
their ideas and their abilities to

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,040
create some type of social change now

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,720
I'm not talking about revolts I'm not

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,910
talking about revolution I'm not talking

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,200
about anything related to that but

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,360
something that you're passionate about

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,300
that you want to voice your opinion on a

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,520
platform that could magnify and Colet

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,040
help you collaborate with others to make

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,680
a positive change breast cancer

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,960
awareness is not just the national issue

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,310
but it's a global issue suicide

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,710
prevention with so many kids

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,170
unfortunately affected by bullying and

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,150
cyber bullying those changes are really

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,710
important because you can contribute to

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:23,200
the dialogue and the discussion as well

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,610
be a voice not an echo and that's very

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,410
important because you don't want to echo

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,310
somebody else's opinions and ideas

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,800
unless they are in line with what you're

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,320
trying to share unless they are in line

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,820
with what your passions are because too

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,390
many people try to jump on what's called

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,490
the bandwagon and the effects could

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,890
affect not only your profession not only

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,220
your career but your social standing as

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:51,010
well I was talking to someone earlier

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,230
about how in China people's social media

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,600
content can actually affect their career

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,640
choices in their social standing in

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,860
their country because what they have now

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,230
is they have algorithms where it

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,690
monitors people's social media content

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,120
that they post and if they are not

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,280
lined with the thinking of the

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,180
governmental organizations they will

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,680
post their pictures on big billboards

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,440
exclaiming that they're not inline with

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,780
the social content of what's going on in

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,110
their countries so just imagine if you

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,700
are not aligned with certain things that

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,350
are going on with our government and

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,360
they take a picture and they put your

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,740
picture up on a big old billboard and

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,240
they said this person is not aligned

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,850
with what we're thinking about how that

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,500
could affect your career so people from

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,060
time to time say oh that's not going on

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,920
in the world that's not what actually it

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,420
is because the China does not have the

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:50,170
freedoms that we do and there are

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:53,140
certain countries as well yes sir that

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,240
that is true that is true in education

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,340
being an educator you have to be really

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,080
careful particularly about what you post

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,830
about your students your school

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,830
administration if it's in a negative

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:09,070
context that can be detrimental but if

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,020
you're actually speaking about policy

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,140
changes which you think would benefit

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,570
the school overall or curriculum or even

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,180
change it at your school in a positive

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,640
way that's that's not really looked down

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,280
upon but if you're directly verbally

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,680
attacking someone or talking about a

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,460
student we're talking about parents that

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,110
could be a problem

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,010
because you hear more and more now about

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,200
government officials lawyers politicians

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,850
people in law enforcement sporadically

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,170
voicing your opinion and they're not

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,210
thinking about what you're doing they're

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,040
just posting stuff and it comes back to

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,760
bite them so that way you have you do

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,350
have to be very careful in the net the

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,839
human voice is the most perfect

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,180
instrument of all because you have to

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,310
remember somebody is listening to you

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,290
whether you like it or not or whether

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,040
you believe it I'll give you a couple of

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,510
perfect examples Walmart in Jacksonville

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,150
every once in a while go to Walmart do

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:09,160
some shopping and off in the distance

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:11,860
I'll hear this little voice and I'm like

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,390
looking around like I'm just hearing

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,640
things I'm just having a flashback to

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,050
school so I'm walking towards warm I did

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,759
not hear again

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,410
and I'm looking like where is this

00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,720
coming from and it's a little kid in

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:27,170
your parents car hanging out the window

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,860
waving at me okay so your voice does

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,139
matter

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,389
it's always important when you're

00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,819
involved in the area of Technology or

00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,160
your business that somebody is always

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,899
watching you and that little voice

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,999
doesn't necessarily have to be a voice

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,860
that you can hear by your ears it could

00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:45,829
be a voice digitally whether somebody

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:49,369
sends you a tweet a Facebook message or

00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:51,470
Instagram we replied to your YouTube

00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:54,410
channel something that's out there and

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,639
the appropriate thing to do is most of

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,339
the time is to provide a response to it

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,470
that's positive informative and

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,899
educational because you look at the

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,040
opportunities to share content with

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,660
others now if there's somebody out there

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,279
just just saying bad things about you

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,989
and talking about you in most of the

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,499
cases that's just you know you just

00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:16,759
ignore that because there's a little I

00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,660
don't say controversy but people are

00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,829
talking about whether you should have

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,049
comments on or not on WordPress I keep

00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,019
my comments on because I love to get

00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:30,279
feedback good and bad because I gauge

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,779
that how my content is affecting people

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:38,410
inspiring them inspiring people and

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:42,889
encouraging people where's your voice

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:46,579
what type of voice do you have engage

00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:50,480
interact and inspire okay digitally and

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:53,410
vocally so if I asked you right now to

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,869
stand up which I'm not going to do and

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:00,799
scream at the top of your lungs what

00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:02,720
you're passionate about how much relief

00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,339
do you think you would feel emotionally

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,010
and mentally just to get it all out of

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,620
your system and some people do that

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,220
online through their blogging through

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,990
youtube through other digital content so

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,020
they may not be able to do it physically

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,120
but they do it online so you have to

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,100
think about what type of voice do you

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,350
want to be known for what type of

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,059
information do you want to share and not

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,949
only that how is it affecting your brand

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,840
in your business because we do hear from

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,730
time to time people get frustrated at

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,080
work and they share their idea

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,660
the opinions like the young man was

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,429
talking about and it does come back but

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,250
think about your content does it inspire

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,260
people does it does it encourage people

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,530
does it educate people what does it

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,070
actually do we have the opportunity for

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,309
Alexa on my quest to teach calm to have

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,820
that actually read using create my voice

00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:59,030
so technology is allowing you to change

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,280
and be more accessible with people that

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,080
are physically challenged as well so a

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,490
lot of us don't really have time some

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,559
time to sit down and actually read a

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,870
book but think about how powerful it

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,000
could be if you're blogging and you can

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,400
have Alexa or Google actually read your

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,309
content and that could inspire others

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,350
that may not have that direct access to

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:22,360
actually read a blog or take the time to

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,360
sit down and actually read the blog

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,880
we're all content creators every one of

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,740
us whether we're whether what it doesn't

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,840
matter what type of social media content

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,870
we're using so raise your hand if you're

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,460
you are a blogger and when I say blogger

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,040
I mean traditional blogger that's you

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:45,230
blog and you post content what is your

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,100
blog about humor in life okay who else

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,110
raised your hand

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,600
what young man in the back what is your

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,600
blog about yes sir

00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:02,299
servant leadership okay anybody else yes

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:04,630
sir okay you want to say that again for

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,630
everybody

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,970
okay so that's a really good social

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,900
issue right there okay would you like it

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:25,300
what is the name of your armed blog

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:27,820
block techcom okay thank you very much

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,010
for sharing so there's different ideas

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,760
different resources out there that are

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:36,550
available and in our open source

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,400
community it's all built it's all built

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:42,600
around us as a community and sharing

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,600
information with each other

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,970
think about how influential your brand

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,670
is currently how it will be in the

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,820
future and can potentially be

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,340
transformative we can transform people's

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,950
minds by the content that we post we can

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,680
transform people's minds by our actions

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,330
and our behaviors now we're going to get

00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,000
out of the digital content we're going

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,760
to get into how we interact socially

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,490
within the communities that we're in so

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,490
here we have a word camp where we can

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,530
ask for them and as I said before if you

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,910
have a pocket full of business cards by

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,070
the end of the day you should have

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,930
everybody else's business card and not

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,370
just your own but if you didn't bring a

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,730
business card you should have somebody's

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:30,040
Twitter address email something so that

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,020
way you can stay in contact with

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,420
individuals or groups that are here I

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,400
eat and I we love to engage in Toddlers

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,010
people because we share resources with

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,070
each other because I either she creates

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,930
she builds small business websites she

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,150
doesn't do the big giant websites but

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,400
she does the small business but it helps

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,950
because when you're talking to people

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,840
about their ideas in your business you

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,170
may not be able to provide a particular

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,210
service with what you do but you gain

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,490
those resources so you can connect

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,290
people with each other and not only are

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,720
you connecting businesses with each

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:07,720
other but you're connecting people that

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,720
may have similar social ideas for change

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,030
or encouragement or advancement that may

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,590
help each other so being an open-source

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,840
community we have this great opportunity

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,940
to share content with each other that's

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,060
really important so some of y'all may

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,430
know this 50 million uses for radio it

00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,840
took 38 years 13 years

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,440
for television and 54 years for the

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,390
Internet

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,430
I love NPR they provide some great

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,220
information how many I have ever had an

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,990
NPR moment and you just sitting there

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,990
and you just listening well they share

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,650
some valuable information the reason I

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:47,980
bring that up too is because the content

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,290
that we absorb around us creates in our

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,980
mind and emotional and psychological

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:57,160
impact that sometimes we can't keep to

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,320
ourselves and sometimes it helps when

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,280
we're listening to NPR or other programs

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,680
that we reply to the information that's

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,690
being broadcast whether we agree with it

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,000
or whether we disagree with it because

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,160
that helps contribute to the discussion

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,410
and sometimes people are reluctant to do

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,670
that because they keep it inside of them

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,100
they're like well nobody wants to listen

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,780
to me nobody wants to hear me but what

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,430
are you doing to be proactive to

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,470
actually share the content of

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,750
information that you have because you

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,210
never know you may share something that

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,030
can potentially transform somebody

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,130
mentally there's a young named young man

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,470
named Steve Swartz that we know he's an

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,850
awesome photographer and he is an

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:42,400
security digital security he encourages

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,920
as many people he's like an evangelist

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,540
for a wordpress and word cam because

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,970
what he'll do is he'll he listened to

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,100
people speak and talk but then he'll

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,180
understand that they may be reluctant to

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:59,200
even apply to speak at a work camp to

00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:01,660
even apply to volunteer and he is really

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,490
passionate about it he inspires me he

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,850

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:19,120
as well what he'll do in our demonstrate

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,890
who would like to be a volunteer okay

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,890

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,140
all right what is your name sir out

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,580
there

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,710
nice to meet you William so if you stand

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,720
right here and what did you what do you

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:40,720

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,680
can network and connect so actually this

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,630
is what Steve will do have you ever

00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,850
thought about speaking out of work him

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,370
speaking out of where it began

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:54,310
okay it's my first work give my hand is

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,020
this first word there all right so I'm

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,040
going to emulate what Steve does and

00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,830
this is where we share content

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,680
information think about this you have so

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:05,230
much information in your head that you

00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,930
are doing people a disservice not to

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,060
apply to speak at a work here so it's

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,750
not all about just the technology it's

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:16,330
about what passion you have with music

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,850
that you can apply at a word camp to

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,850
inspire people okay so when the next

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:24,550
opportunity comes up apply and think of

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,650
a great caption and title and put

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,090
together great presentation so that you

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,790
can share that information with others

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:35,950
down here all right sounds good yes sir

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:37,870
appreciate you yeah that was a mellow

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,900
Steve Steve will I get in your face and

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,730
points like you can't do this so but it

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,900
still helps to inspire us and it doesn't

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,730
matter what age or what gender or what

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,440
cultural background it doesn't matter

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,210
because we're in an open-source

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,150
community and this is where the

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,020
diversity and the inclusiveness

00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,760
inclusiveness comes in we all have

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,650
issues we just deal with them in

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,290
different ways and in diverse priorities

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,750
so we know who the two young people

00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,730
things over there are right so they

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,370
create a lot of social issues you know

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,960
good bad and different but we also have

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,320
some social issues that we're dealing

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,380
with as well and everybody has some type

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,270
of opinion you cannot not have an

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,180
opinion about some of these social

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,610
issues so whether you're engaging in the

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,470
conversation or not there comes a point

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,290
where you actually have to deal with

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,950
those issues whether on a personal basis

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:38,290
a business basis a community basis

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,130
or whatever you have to have an opinion

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,120
so we're at an age now we're in

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,780
inundated with so much information

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,150
digitally we have to categorize the

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:54,550
information where we can deal with it

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:56,950
and we can address it identify what your

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,960
passions are and once you identify what

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,110
they are you deal with them and address

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,450
them so as I said before your passions

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,000
also sometimes directly affect your

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,130
brand and your brand also affects your

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,630
passions now how does that work so when

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,130
you're getting a social context and

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,560
you're speaking about different issues

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,880
you have to make sure you understand

00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,650
where you stand on those various issues

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,840
because in one way or another if you're

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,560
a business person you're going to be

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,150
directly affected by those issues and

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,430
you have to think well how is that going

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:33,580
to impact my brand how is that going to

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,950
impact my business in a discussion what

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,620
am I going to stand on that I'm

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,040
passionate about so the change is in you

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,980
the strategy is what you apply to direct

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,780
those issues your integrity and ethics

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,650
all of us have some type of integrity

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,140
and ethics if you don't think you do

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,970
have a social issue come up and you're

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,220
going to address it in some type of way

00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,470
be honest and define your principles

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,930
what are your principles and the issues

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,670
that you're dealing with or the issues

00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,930
that somebody wants your opinion about

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,120
because somebody may ask you your

00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,530
opinion well as a business owner what do

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,350
you think about such as such and such

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,030
and such so besides just the government

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,280
saying when you have to address these

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,070
issues as a business owner or as

00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,480
entrepreneurs solopreneur what are your

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,820
issues about it what is what is your

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,530
idea your words decent actions also

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,210
define who you are and I know this is a

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,700
lot of information to go through but

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,440
these are things for you to think about

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,940
because you never know they may come up

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,130
and you're gonna have to address them

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,380
address them then so be sure you're

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,880
relevant by diversifying your knowledge

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,760
and the great thing is we're all here at

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,620
a work camp so our knowledge is building

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,350
on the different workshops that we're

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,720
attending so the more you empower your

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,370
brain the better you are able

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,400
to deal with what you might have to

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,890
address and that helps not only for your

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,530
business to grow but it allows your your

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,500
brand to expand too because there's a

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:06,340
saying that says you want your brand to

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:09,190
be so strong that your brand arrives at

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,690
a place before you actually do so when

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,790
you're looking at the names of the

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,560
speakers and their presentations you

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:18,040
want to make sure that your brand is

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,980
known to be a positive brand to be

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,720
encouraging and lightning educational so

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,600
that people understand what your brand

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,240
is about and how or where you stand on

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,580
certain issues be ready for the long

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,140
haul be faithful to your cause don't be

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,570
scared to seek collaboration because we

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,490
can't all do it alone we have to work

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,470
together just like the young man with

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,960
his logo and a young lady that's the

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,390
graphic designer that's the perfect

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:51,670
connection think about how you can help

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:53,560
solve an issue for others okay you have

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,710
a story others need to hear what is your

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,540
story it's okay to share sometimes what

00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,800
has what you have gone through what you

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,990
have been taught which you have helped

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,080
others why is that important because a

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,120
lot of brands now are addressing social

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,920
issues and not only are they addressing

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,440
social issues but they're providing

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,520
resources maybe not directly from them

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,770
but they're making those connections

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,150
with each other they're building

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,740
collaborations they're building

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,090
partnerships and that goes back to

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,670
another thing to consider as a business

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,800
owner are you and your business involved

00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,630
in the community what are you doing to

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,670
promote social change are you

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,670
participating in breast cancer awareness

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,830
walks are you participating in diabetes

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,710
or or high blood pressure walks or what

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,200
are you doing to help a cause are you

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,730
sponsoring are you promoting are you

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,470
advocating and when I said that it

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,200
doesn't always come down to a money

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,300
thing it comes down to how is your brand

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,120
and how is your business making a

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,320
presence in the community so SEO and

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,760
Google are good but I look at those as

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,830
clinical applications because they're

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,470
digital they don't get out and be and

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,140
they're not involved in the community if

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,600
you want to build your business

00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,929
word-of-mouth is still one of the better

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,390
ways to do it can people see you can

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:11,640
they shake your hand can they talk to

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,710
you of 5 or 10 minutes about what your

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,960
ideas and opinions are are you involved

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,030
in the community what are you doing to

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,220
help sponsor promote things in schools

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,890
so that people know what your business

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:26,669
is about and what you're doing Pepsi

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:29,280
Coke Disney they are all awesome at that

00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:31,230
even though they have a dynamic team you

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,750
yourself with your business and being an

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,130
entrepreneur within your community think

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,929
about what you're sponsoring and think

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,360
about what you're promoting think about

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:42,419
what you're engaged in to build your

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,010
business is an icon in your community so

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,370
when something comes up in your

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,110
community they may go out and ask for

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,150
promotion from other businesses but is

00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,789
your business one of those yet people

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,679
think about oh well we can go to this

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,570
business in our community or this person

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,400
to act in the sponsor it whether there's

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,720
something at a school or whether it's

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,730
something at a hospital or something

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,200
like there okay this is an interactive

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,150
part it's gonna take a couple of minutes

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,070
what you're going to do is write down

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,280
three social issues you are passionate

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:17,190
about enough to change so the tablets

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,220
that you have if you need a pen or

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,530
something take it out so we have a few

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,760
minutes so what we're going to do this

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,909
your little homework assignment right

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,280
here alright so write down three social

00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:33,510
issues you are passionate about enough

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,450
to change and I'll tell you like I tell

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,240
my students at school it's okay to be

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:43,760
scared to voice your opinion because

00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:46,440
that fear or that hesitation also brings

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,220
some wisdom because you don't want to be

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,049
too vocal on a particular situation if

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,140
you don't have all the information that

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:56,700
you need so when you think about what

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,490
you're passionate about it what social

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,809
issue what three are you passionate

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:06,000
about somebody has to be passionate

00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:08,159
about something and then after you write

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,309
that down write down why you want to

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,000
make the changes and who the changes

00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,000
will benefit

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,109
because you can take the same

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,019
information as you're writing it down

00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:22,700
and apply it to your business what

00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,279
direction do you want to take your

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,190
business why do you want to take it that

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,220
way what type of change will the

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,369
redirection of your business create

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,529
because every once in a while we have to

00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:38,600
retransform our business ideas because

00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:41,359
if we're going down the road and we come

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,309
to a fork in the road we have to decide

00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,289
or we don't go to the left or to the

00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:49,419
right with our business what is the best

00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:52,460
option with the information that we have

00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:55,850
the other thing too is will the changes

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:58,759
be sustainable and in one of the

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,940
previous slides the long haul it takes a

00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:05,629
while for change to happen are you ready

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,239
to take that time to keep it sustainable

00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:12,230
and then write down three people who you

00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:15,139
think will work with you because as a

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:18,109
community an open source community 'ti

00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:20,869
it takes each and every one of us to

00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:23,269
create an atmosphere that welcomes

00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:25,480
diversity that welcomes inclusiveness in

00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:29,570
the wordpress the word camp community

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,210
this is why as an educator and a parent

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,190
that young people are very key and very

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,499
important because we should embrace and

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,739
encourage more young people to attend

00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:42,739
word camps because they are our future

00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:45,320
because as business owners we can mentor

00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:47,470
them and we can help them not make the

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,669
mistakes that we made as business owners

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:54,799
establishing our businesses and building

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:57,320

intern for you one day or he may be a

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,810

it's better to collaborate with him now

because as he gets older he may start

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,829
his own business and turn out to be your

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,270

00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,200

as other options for careers or

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,240

00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,600
thank you for sharing this so we've all

00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,730
been here when I first started out I

00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,170
wanted to be a fighter pilot and I

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,480
wanted to fly jets and I knew

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,910
specifically what I wanted to fly I

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,550
wanted to fly an f4 phantom in the

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,400
United States Air Force I wanted to fly

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,560
200 feet off the ground and go

00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,660
supersonic that's all I wanted to do for

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,400
a long time but then when I started

00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,470
working with kids it's like okay well

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,210
this seems like a better career than

00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:56,840
something potentially could happen in

00:36:53,210 --> 00:37:00,200
and gent like that so okay so would

00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,430
anybody like to stand up and share what

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,450
they wrote down and for social issues

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:08,110
that did that they are passionate about

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,110
okay yes sir

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:19,850
okay okay all right awesome okay so the

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:29,770
next one is why do you want to make

00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:29,770
changes with those okay

00:37:33,249 --> 00:38:22,960
okay okay okay right okay right right

00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:28,779
okay

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:08,820
opportunity's okay thank you for sure

00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:10,830
give them a hand and when you think

00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,600
about that think about that as a cut in

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:16,590
the context of being a business owner

00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,690
your business is relied upon the social

00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,280
economic status of those people that

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,410
you're going to be doing business with

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,140
and you have to think about your

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,210
location does your location or the

00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,160
changes in your location how is that

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,350
going to affect your business now your

00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,630
business may totally be digital but you

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,270
still have to think about in the digital

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,520
world who your potential customers are

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,400
and how far you have to branch out from

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,160
where you are or who you directly

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,530
working with or who your potential

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,150
customers are because that still affects

00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:52,350
your business in some form of fashion

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:55,080
thank you for sharing your branch of

00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:58,880
command all right it's not personal but

00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:02,910
it is how much strength does your brand

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,980
command attention to it when people do a

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,380
Google search and this is where SEO and

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,140
Google comes in are people bringing up

00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,930
your business are you known in your

00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,720
community to promote and sponsor and

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:18,360
advocate because you do have a voice and

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,700
it's all about your voice your brand and

00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,550
your business and again I believe I said

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,920
this earlier one case years ago your

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,470
brand and your personal relationship

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,850
where it's totally separate people would

00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,920
say okay you have to have a Facebook

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,180
account for your your business and then

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,030
you have to have a personal account

00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,210
which is all well and good but now it's

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:41,880
connected dynamically because people see

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,010
ok you have a business but what is your

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,589
business doing they're socially

00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,119
responsible and socially engaging so now

00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:52,499
you have to have those thoughts about it

00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,299
as well what directions are you going

00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:57,329
and which is focused is your is your

00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,839
focus is your Direction focused or is it

00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,119
blurry

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,799
can you see five years down the road

00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,660
what's gonna go on with your business

00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:05,279
can you see or are you playing in ten

00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,589
years down the road you have to do that

00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:09,630
now with the changes in technology with

00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:11,789
the changes in the socioeconomic status

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,819
of millions of Americans in the United

00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:19,349
States what's going on socially now that

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:20,269
will directly affect you your branding

00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:24,059
your voice

00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:26,430
encourages you you unity teamwork and

00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,140
embraces diversity you have an

00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,809
opportunity through your brand in your

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,089
business and your voice to create some

00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:35,099
type of change and this is why I

00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:37,559
emphasize that a lot of businesses too

00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,630
no matter what size they are to be

00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,299
involved in community activities and

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,979
events that are going on in your area

00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:46,890
because not only are you creating a

00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:49,229
change you're providing your voice but

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,960
you are showing that businesses are

00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:54,450
important in the direction of social

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,640
issues because you do not want to get

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,859
caught in a position where someone knows

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,109
that you have a business but then they

00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,880
come up directly to you and ask you why

00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:06,660
are you not involved in this social

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,400
issue where are who you align with who

00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,829
are you collaborating with what are you

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,989
doing as a business owner to help create

00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:18,150
some type of change do you inspire

00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:20,729
collaboration and no single component is

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,769
important everybody is important when

00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:24,630
you contribute when you collaborate and

00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:26,700
this is why I doing presentations I love

00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,950
to get engagement with each other to

00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,989
find out who may need a type of resource

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,329
as I said before this is a wonderful

00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:36,229
networking environment but we sometimes

00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:38,969
don't know that until we actually engage

00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:42,839
with each other while we're in here at

00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:45,479
wordcamp diversity of content creation

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,549
everyone can contribute so we have a few

00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:50,910
minutes left so what I would like to do

00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:52,739
before it's time to go to people that

00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,650
are close to you what you're going to do

00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:57,269
is you are going to greet them shake

00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,109
their hands and you're going to exchange

00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:00,789
some information about actually

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,650
your businesses and what your brand is

00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:04,869
and maybe you can find some type of

00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,700
collaboration between each other so it's

00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:09,549
only gonna take a couple of minutes so

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,630
don't be shy all right and you know

00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:12,670
you're just going to introduce yourself

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,529
and find out from each other what you do

00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:18,809
what your brain is and what your

00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:18,809
business is and go ahead and go

00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:34,980
so as you're greeting each other make

00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:57,210
sure you shake hands and you share

00:43:34,980 --> 00:44:09,170
content and information okay I'm 10:15

00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:14,490
should be done okay so I love the smiles

00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:16,380
the eye-to-eye engagement you have a

00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:20,430
couple of people moving around which is

00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:24,210
good if you have business cards don't

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:26,579
forget to share your business cards also

00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:29,190

you would like to continue the

00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,380
discussion later

00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:06,000
all right so as your do talking I'm

00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:11,670
going to take a video of everybody

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,870
engaged sharing information providing

00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:18,540
some feedback to each other I see some

00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:24,630
people sharing there are social media

00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:28,760
information and it's great to see the

00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,760
young people being involved too as well

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:45,860
all right

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:45,860
okay so let's wind it down oh thank you

00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:56,820
I don't want to break it I have to pay

00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:59,680
for it okay let's have your closing

00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,099
closing because you can also still talk

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,700
at the happiness bar at the end as well

00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:11,079

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,160
yes

00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:19,329
okay let's wind it down so we can

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,650
continue see this is the danger when you

00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:26,700
get people talking this how you gonna

00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:31,990
wind up yeah

00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:33,790
okay so we're going to continue on so at

00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,530
your closing remarks make sure you have

00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,849
their contact information in case you

00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:42,970
want to contact them later

00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:45,940
good job wonderful the content that

00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:49,089
y'all created great content is important

00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,160
in great content matters not the quality

00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:54,520
because you can sit there and talk for

00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,980
an hour and not share great content

00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,930
quality content it's the type of

00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,569
information and engagement that you have

00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:03,940
that's really important so like I try to

00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,380
teach the young people at the school

00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,510
that I teach even though it's elementary

00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,640
school it's really important that when

00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,349
you're engaged in information with

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,839
someone you're sharing information that

00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:16,690
it's quality information that you can

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:18,400
take with you and not keep with you but

00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,680
you can share it with each other or

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,980
share with others as you travel and as

00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:28,000
you move around so when we go along with

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,310
the presentation collaborations search

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,160
for who and whom you can collaborate

00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:37,119
with and always encourage collaboration

00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:40,150
versus competition if you think about

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,980
how large Google is Google if you think

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,740
about how large Facebook is with

00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:47,920
Facebook or YouTube those are just not

00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,930
one entities there are multiple

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,240
businesses or multiple organizations

00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:58,300
that create a global economic power

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,100
within Google and when you look at the

00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,620
infrastructure of goo

00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,810
you also look at some of their business

00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:08,590
plans and one of them is very

00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:10,840
interesting if a company is created a

00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,420
digital company whether it's a graphics

00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:17,290
company whether it's a digital media

00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,570
company if there's an inkling that it

00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,960
would be competitive with Google or

00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:25,530
Facebook their business strategy is to

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,810
buy that company and absorb them into

00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,850
Google or Facebook because even though

00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,590
they may start off small you look at

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,860
when Facebook started it was a small

00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:38,230
company and now it's a global entity

00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,960
it's engrained in just about everybody's

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,790
life in one way or another so even if

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,680
you don't have a Facebook account if you

00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:47,710
have kids or grandkids or friends that

00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,600
do are you on Facebook can I find you on

00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,580
facebook I'm looking for you on Facebook

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:54,820
I can't find you on Facebook or Twitter

00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,560
or Instagram or whatever so they are

00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:59,140
very important to understand the

00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:02,380
dynamics of businesses so as you as a

00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:05,200
business owner who is your competitor

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,300
are there opportunities to collaborate

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,700
with each other as opposed to compete

00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:13,060
with each other and when you collaborate

00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,460
what type of not just change can you

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,560
make looking at the bottom line but what

00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:24,640
kind of social change can you make as

00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:28,450
well there's a term called so low mo

00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,910
code social and geek engagement visible

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,880
excuse me social engagement local

00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:36,610
visibility mobile agility and community

00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,190
activism I love to be involved in my

00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:41,320
community I either loves to be involved

00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,570
in the community because it provides us

00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,420
an opportunity to share the knowledge

00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:48,280
that we have gained the kids at my

00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,410
school love it when I go off to work

00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,050
hence because when I come back I'll have

00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:55,000
waffles I have stickers I have something

00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,120
to bring back to them to make that

00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,340
connection that is awesome and great to

00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,230
go to conferences so when we inspire

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,660
young people at an early age to go to

00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:06,550
conferences and attend conferences then

00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,550
one they know how to behave when they go

00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:12,190
out in public too they don't know what

00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,119
questions to ask when they find people

00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,730
that are shared

00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,829
same interest in passion 3 that they

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,349
understand that they can have a business

00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:22,869
and be an entrepreneur or a solopreneur

00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:24,339
and even if they don't know what they

00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:27,039
want to do right now they have

00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:30,369
connections people they can go to and

00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:32,200
talk to or connect to digitally to find

00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:34,029
out hey I'm interested in this area I

00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,680
remember I met such-and-such at work

00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:37,630
here maybe I can reach out to them

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,670
through social media and maybe one day I

00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:41,559
can be an intern for them or they can

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,660
direct me to what direction for my

00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,460
career or maybe they can also write a

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,440
letter of recommendation to a college

00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,970
that made they may have attended so you

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,640
look at the broader picture and you look

00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:55,720
at globally how you inspire others as

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,999
well everyone in here you're a writer

00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,490
you're editor a content creator you're

00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:01,900
publishing all of these represent who

00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,970
you are and what you do through your

00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,710
business in your brand if you don't

00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,539
believe that go back and look through

00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,849
the content that you create and that you

00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:12,400
post it online and look at some of the

00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:13,960
engagement if you want to increase your

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,749
engagement if you want to increase your

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,920
voice you have to be involved and you

00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:24,220
have the direct have to directly engage

00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,499
in social issues in your community and

00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,190
in your environment never let the world

00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:31,960
define your success nor neighs layers

00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:33,489
determine your success so once you start

00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,410
putting out content and information if

00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:37,089
you haven't experienced it yet you will

00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,859
have what I call neigh Slayers people

00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:40,329
that would try to tear you down people

00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:42,640
never talk about you people that would

00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:44,499
speak bad about you but then you look at

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,809
it of the context well if I don't ever

00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:49,390
say anything what type of change will I

00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:52,239
potentially make or how would that

00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:54,549
influence my business to grow beyond

00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,099
where you are right now or how

00:51:54,549 --> 00:52:00,759
empowering would that make my brand as

00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:03,039
well because as the years go warn people

00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:05,440
are gonna look at what information did

00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,269
you leave behind what is your legacy

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,099
what are you trying to establish and

00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:10,779
what are you trying to build not just as

00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:14,339
an individual but as a business owner

00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:18,370
and that is the end of my presentation

00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:22,700
so I hope you learned a great deal

00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:24,590
and just take away a lot of the

00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,310
information and share it don't keep it

00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,960
to yourself

00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,090
and remember you can inspire and

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,350
encourage young people get out there and

00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,000
talk to them being gauged and

00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,960
volunteering and get your brand out

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,430
there with your business you should

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,050
always have your business cards and your

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,230
information because you never know who

00:52:36,050 --> 00:53:05,270
you're gonna meet thank you very much

00:52:38,230 --> 00:53:07,880
yes sir yes right well my passion is

00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:10,280
with education and with with so much

00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,860
going on not just locally but but

00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,860
nationally with education what I try to

00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,520
do is find a balance and if it's

00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:21,800
directly related with kids and parents I

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,780
try to find resources that balance out

00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,970
the challenges that parents may be

00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:29,510
facing in school system so let's say if

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:32,510
you have if there's a child that has a

00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:34,160
learning disability as opposed to run

00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,600
into the principal and Sam what we need

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,980
to do this and we need to address this

00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,080
and we need to do that being a teacher

00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,850
that could cause problems for me but

00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,070
finding the resources that I can

00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,710
directly share with parents and say if

00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:48,920
your if your child may have a problem

00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:51,050
with dyslexia or ADHD here are some

00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,880
resources to help you directly address

00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,260
that issue because sometimes school

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,810
districts they don't have the money the

00:53:54,260 --> 00:54:00,140
resources or the personnel to directly

00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:03,410
address that but then the personnel

00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:05,690
involved may not have the language to

00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:08,090
properly speak to the parents which

00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,730
sometimes is the case to talk to the

00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,160
parents about what other alternatives do

00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:15,320
they have and as a teacher you know in

00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,900
the legislature they're making all kinds

00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,340
of changes but the the common sense

00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,020
thing is well we're gonna go talk to

00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,470
teachers about what changes need to be

00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,000
made but in too many cases they don't

00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,950
they'll pass legislation about reading

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,710
math or whatever and we just have to

00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:33,680
deal with it but on that level

00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:35,960
we have to teach a certain curriculum so

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,300
how can I change the curriculum a little

00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,790
bit to meet the needs of my students and

00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,830
that's where like your passion comes in

00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:45,590
the information and resources that you

00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:59,200
can gain or receive how do you share it

00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:59,200
in the community yes yes yes ma'am okay

00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,560
[Music]

00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:48,190
right conversation right right exactly

00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:52,370
right right exactly

00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:54,350
yes ma'am innocent and it's a good idea

00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,090
to attend school board meetings I mean

00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,470
even if you don't have kids attend

00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:00,170
school board meetings to actually find

00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:03,950
out what the schools may need and you

00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:05,660
may have a resource schools need they

00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,820
need money but they also need resources

00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,320
to help people talk to the young people

00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,390
about different social issues that are

00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,490
going on and if you're passionate about

00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:15,320
bullying and cyber-bullying or as you

00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,680
were talking about build those

00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,680
relationships early so that if there is

00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:24,320
a need your name your company your brand

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,030
will come to mind or will reach out to

00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,220
such-and-such and have them come to the

00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,810
school and talk to the kids because a

00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,660
lot of social issues as you remember

00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:35,180
I'll start grassroots and you may not

00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:37,370
hear about them two years later when it

00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:39,110
becomes a I don't see a bigger problem

00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:41,630
but a bigger issue and then everybody

00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,160
has an opinion or perception and people

00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,950
are yelling at each other as opposed to

00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,720
like you were saying

00:56:43,950 --> 00:57:55,380
building a relationship thank you very

00:56:48,720 --> 00:57:57,119
much okay so we'll do one more question

00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:01,400
but I'll be here so if anybody has any

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,400
additional questions I'll be what happy

00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,289
[Music]

00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:04,360
well thank wonder thing and I always go

00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,320
in I always reference this there was a I

00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,900
have two kids

00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,270
they're both 20 in their 20s and it was

00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,220
a there was a time as they were growing

00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:14,050
up that I would not listen to anything

00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,760
that cuz I'm like I'm dad

00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,320
you know I got more experience more life

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,470
than you do but there was a time where I

00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,180
had I had to stop and think well maybe

00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:25,210
there is something that they can

00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:28,120
contribute to educate me and have me to

00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:31,630
learn about the world through their eyes

00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:34,180
cuz now there's so many so much going on

00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:36,880
that I have to adapt and adjust my

00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,980
thinking to be able to address social

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,900
issues that are going on now that I may

00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:45,700
not have had to deal with when I was

00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:49,060
growing up so instead of houses be

00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:52,120
telling my kids how I think I asked them

00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:55,300
what do you think and that helps me to

00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,250
understand not just my opinion and

00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:03,190
perception but how does it look from

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:06,490
their eyes and gay pride or racism or

01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:10,480
other social issues I have to learn what

01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:12,820
did you experience in your life that

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,880
you're passionate about so I can find a

01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:18,640
way to help promote you or support you

01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,970
to live a positive and productive life

01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:25,120
it's not my intent to change them but

01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:27,490
how can I help you be more positive and

01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:31,120
productive in the world because as a

01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,880
business owner you may be a client you

01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:37,600
know one day you we may collaborate on a

01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,480
project we may have to work together on

01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,339
a board or something so even though we

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,680
may have a difference of opinion

01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:46,599
there has to be a line where we can come

01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:50,949
and agree to disagree

01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:53,469
or I can learn how when I say this I can

01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:55,180
learn how I can work with you and you

01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:56,859
can see my opinion and I can see your

01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,630
opinion we can respect each other as

01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:00,910
opposed to saying you're totally wrong

01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:03,789
you shouldn't be doing this but that's

01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:05,199
not my life that's their life and you

01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:07,630
know sometimes you just have to step

01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,939
back a little bit or a lot and look at

01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:12,759
it from another person's perspective to

01:01:09,939 --> 01:01:15,789
say well has that ever or that situation

01:01:12,759 --> 01:01:18,579
ever happened to me and if it did how

01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:22,329
did I respond or react to it or if it if

01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:24,969
it does I may need your help to help

01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:28,199
address this issue because it may affect

01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:32,259
a family member and there unfortunately

01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:34,839
there are kids that are LBGT that are

01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:37,479
being kicked out of their homes they're

01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:41,769
