okay well thanks for coming and welcome

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,269
to SEO eavesdropping I was really

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,969
excited to put this presentation

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,410
together because honestly spying on

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,320
other people is really fun

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,730
and whenever anyone is at the top of

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,250
search results are getting a great deal

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,830
of traffic from search results it's for

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,660
a reason and they've invested a lot into

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,340
content development we talk about

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,289
content all the time but I think

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,190
sometimes it gets a little confusing to

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,530
know how do we approach that so we can

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,050
learn from the investments that others

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,710
have made and look at the techniques

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,149
that they practiced and hopefully apply

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,770
those to the sites that you all are

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,800
working on are the businesses that you

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,360
are working within based on what we can

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,399
learn from digging in to

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,980
behind-the-scenes of a few people that

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,989
are doing it really well so i'm lee

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,739
akeem tall I work at status word which

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,719
is a digital digital brand development

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,450
web development design SEO marketing

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,189
company here in town and I've been doing

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,140
search engine optimization for about

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,000
eight years and it's a lot of fun so a

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,530
lot of people are interested in search

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,509
engine optimization we're gonna talk

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,580
about keywords we're gonna talk about

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,009
search volumes but mostly what we're

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,590
talking about is content and what users

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,689
are really looking for and talking about

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,220
keywords and search volumes is a way to

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,140
help us understand more of what

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,180
opportunities are out there and how

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,520
other people are taking advantage of

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,310
those opportunities so search engine

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,110
optimization itself that for that word

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,659
is searched two hundred and fourteen

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,700
thousand times each month on average in

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,020
the United States so we're just gonna

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,670
get some kind of numbers out there

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,930
because we'll be talking about this I'm

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,570
going content strategy five point four

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,670
thousand times each month in the US and

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,710
this is really just a fraction of the

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,740
total search volumes because we all know

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,570
how we search and as Google becomes more

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,399
sophisticated and search results are

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,829
changing and the way we interact with

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,349
search through voice and whatnot

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,250
what we see in terms of phrases is

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,310
really like a fraction of what's out

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,620
there and so SEO examples which is

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,890
something I'm focusing on today only

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,460
registers 250 searches per month but I

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,040
think one of the best ways of learning

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,270
something complex like content strategy

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,860
is to really have examples of how that

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,200
functioned for someone else and what

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,970
success looked like for the website in

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,130
relation to that content strategy so

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,520
first I want to just back up a minute

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,620
and talk about how content-based SEO

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,080
works so the types of sites we're gonna

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,750
look at today are people that rely on

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,570
getting traffic from search results from

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,380
people who could be anywhere so it's not

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,070
we're not talking about like

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,420
location-based local SEO trying to get

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,580
traffic to like a brick and mortar

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,860
storefront we're talking about people

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,190
that need traffic to their digital

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,380
presence online and how does content and

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,489
building content for search engines

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,640
function in that capacity so this is my

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:23,320
graphic design skills in action that's

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,440
not what I do but so with SEO traffic

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,209
from search results that is one piece of

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,610
any kind of digital marketing effort is

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,130
it is one channel and the purpose like

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,709
many others is to drive traffic to your

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,320
website and then what you do with it

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,940
when you get there is the function of

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,799
your website so that's how you begin to

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,739
understand what does success for my

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,630
website look like so SEO is one channel

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,880
you might be trying to like build your

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,820
email list where you might later deliver

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,410
promotions and then people could return

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:59,440
to your site and that's where conversion

00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:02,470
happens so SEO is often about ultimately

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,810
building brand awareness and how do you

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,880
do that if people already know who you

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,130
are and they're searching for you that's

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,610
that's the biggest win like you've made

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,590
it your brand is known and searched for

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,109
but a lot of times how content and how

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,690
SEO works to do that is by getting

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,549
traffic to your site not because people

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,169
would know to Google you by name but

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,510
because they Google things you do

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,260
products you offer services you are

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,570
for that type of stuff and then they

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,780
arrive on pages and posts in your

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,230
building authority on topics across what

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,390
your primary kind of expertise is and

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,340
the more you do that the more people

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,370
know who you are and ultimately search

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,840
for you by your name which is going to

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,400
ultimately lead to the best conversion

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,910
rates because they already know who you

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,470
are and what they do and they want you

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,500
so let's just kind of play through a

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,200
couple how some websites function in

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,360
relationship to search results so best

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,730
Star Trek captain we don't really need

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,080
to Google it because everybody knows

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:10,480
it's the card but this phrase gets three

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,570
hundred and fifty searches a month in

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,120
the US on average so let's just look at

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,890
the search results so what we see here

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,470
is a rich search result that's when

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,870
Google is scraping content directly from

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,880
a website and displaying it in search

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,610
results I'm sure you've all noticed this

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,100
it's more and more prevalent and it's

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,700
becoming I mean it's gonna get really

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,370
interesting honestly in the next year so

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,590
what we see here is if I'm the user and

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm just wondering I'm googling this

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,630
oftentimes you know you click the first

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,340
search result or especially like a rich

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,520
search result like this so I need to

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,020
click on this because I want to contest

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:56,320
this result because John let's never do

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,880
so if we get to this website this is the

00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,040
website of the first search result so

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,610
how does SEO function to help them

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,440
accomplish their objectives so they're

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,660
pulling in traffic from search results

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,420
on this article how do they make money

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,890
they're selling ads so the more people

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,390
that come to the website the more they

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,520
can make off of the advertisements like

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,800
this print ad and they're also trying to

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,690
drive people to subscribe so the more

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,620
that they are blanketing the internet

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:26,040
with cut and this is like a I forgot MC

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,040
what do they do

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:38,159
so yeah this is a um like a culture

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,689
website so they're writing hundreds and

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,509
thousands of articles on different

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,840
aspects of pop culture and you know

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,599
plastering it everywhere and this one

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,729
article this one star trek article is

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,349
optimized exactly for what I was

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,719
interested in and I may not have known

00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,069
who they were and now I do and maybe

00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,560
it's gonna be something I start

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:02,009
following to get more information on

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,560
this type of news and that is success

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,419
for them and that's how they can charge

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,180
more for ads and that's how it plays

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:14,719
into how SEO plays into them

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,719
accomplishing their objectives oops

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,990
okay so let's take another search this

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,510
may have been one I've done personally

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,370
so cat themed clothes and clothing who

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,550
doesn't want that but you're not looking

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,550
necessarily for a specific company cat

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,830
themed clothing 450 searches a month so

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,620
of course any e-commerce is really the

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,960
most obvious like SEO play ever if

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,940
you're selling things online you need

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,530
you want people to who are searching for

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,100
things that you offer to arrive on your

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,680
website so Kathleen clothing let's look

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,630
at the search results we see some ads

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,130
and then the first search result which

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,570
is a website we're going to explore

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,250
further it's one of my favorites

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:09,370
mountains so cat themed apparel clothing

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,140
for cat lovers alright I'm interested in

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,090
this I click on the search results and

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,130
then how do they make money of course

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,020
there's the most obvious direct action I

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,840
could immediately land on their site and

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,490
make a purchase but then they're doing a

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,430
good job of driving other types of

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,040
conversions and trying to really like

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,910
maximize the potential for me to convert

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:35,440
when I'm a first-time visitor so free

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:38,440
earrings Father's Day sale ads so that

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,419
is how SEO would make play into them

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,340
accomplishing how they make money online

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,380
and we'll go through this with the other

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,340
examples as well so who are we going to

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,960
spy on REI

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,210
there's probably if there's any does

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:58,630
anyone not know who REI is right so REI

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,450
like years and years ago executed the

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,670
one of the most kind of masterful SEO

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,400
content strategies that really ever

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,370
happened ever and I'm always really

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,020
impressed with whoever convinced them to

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,550
invest the amount of money they did to

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,830
make this happen because now they're

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,620
pervasive they are the case study for

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,960
content-based SEO work and we're also

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,220
going to look at mountains and then I

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,160
want to mix it up because I know

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,930
everyone's coming from a different a

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,150
different type of company or you have

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,610
different types of clients so we want to

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,170
look at different ways that what success

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,300
looks like for different companies

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,790
online that aren't as obvious as

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,270
e-commerce so a nonprofit campaign

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,870
called water use it wisely

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:45,170
a real-estate agency from kind of near

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,120
where I grew up and a blog a blog that's

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,970
purpose is to make money a personal

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,190
finance blog alright so what I'm gonna

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,190
use to go through this is my favorite

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,670
SEO tool called a troughs and what this

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,399
allows us to do is really dig in to get

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,580
numbers behind the strategies the

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,230
content strategies that these people are

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,410
employing on their sites so it gives us

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,450
the data on search volumes and the

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,190
amount of keywords that a certain

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,470
article is appearing for in search

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,770
results and this information is really

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,959
amazing when you are trying to figure

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,200
out how you can fit into search results

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,740
so it is a paid tool they don't pay me

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,230
but you can do a trial and we'll talk

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,850
more about ways that you can do this at

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,770
towards the end of the presentation so

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:40,490
let's start with REI they are the

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:43,279
content master they have 3.1 million

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,339
keywords for which their site is

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,620
appearing in search results and through

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,510
those keywords in search results in

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,880
their articles appearing everywhere

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,970
online they're getting seven point six

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,160
million visitors on average per month

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,720
and this is an estimate based on where

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,020
they're appearing in search results and

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,940
for how many keywords and then I include

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,459
in all of these sites an authority score

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,320
it's ultimately ultimately what you're

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,470
always trying to do is build the

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,390
authority of your site and content is a

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,730
part of that becoming an authority on

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,000
the topics that matter to your to what

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,880
you offer and what you do so this kind

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,430
of helps frame where different companies

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,290
are at based on you know their journey

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:32,779
and building traffic to their site so

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:36,260
this is their home page and what I want

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:40,850
to point out are these two folders one

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,970
of the biggest jobs for content SEO is

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:48,589
to figure out how you're organizing your

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:50,480
content like where is it going what what

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:51,769
does the what do the folders look like

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,600
like what does the URL

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,629
look like and how do they relate to one

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,360
another and how does the user find that

00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:02,569
content in a way that it's not it

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,339
doesn't impede the experience should

00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:07,459
they be just showing up from from a

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,619
shopping perspective so REI has these

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,619
two areas their co-op journal that's

00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:15,259
their blog and this expert advice

00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:23,949
section and the expert advice section is

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:27,019
the SEO content masterpiece portal so

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:29,540
why the architecture is super important

00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,790
because the way that search results are

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,920
working more and more is certain types

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,799
of content will rise to the top you

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,139
might write like a thousands of posts

00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,660
and they're going to be like five or six

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:44,269
that are accounting for the majority of

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,579
your traffic and likewise it's the kind

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,799
of folding and how you how you put that

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:51,470
together so let's talk about some

00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,299
numbers here because we're gonna go over

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,240
them for a lot so this number is an

00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:59,329
estimated amount of monthly traffic that

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,999
these sections of the website get and

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,259
then the value we don't have to worry

00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,790
about that that it's kind of an

00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,309
estimation of if you are paying for

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,649
advertising on those keywords instead of

00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:12,319
appearing organically in search results

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,480
like what is a estimated value of what

00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,779
that would cost you per month and then

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,389
the keywords which is really fun is how

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,509
many keywords these sections of the site

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,910
appear in search results for and then

00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:28,069
pages is how many pages in that section

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,369
so the expert advice section of REI

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:34,069
which we're gonna dig into there's 521

00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:35,929
pages in that so part of what this shows

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:38,619
too is the amount of the significant

00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:41,059
amount of effort that it takes to really

00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:44,059
be the best in search results but

00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:46,189
there's opportunities for everyone REI

00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,839
is objective was to take over on

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:50,119
everything related to the outdoor

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,879
industry in search results and they did

00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:56,119
but it took a whole lot of work and part

00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:01,399
of that is these 521 pages that are all

00:13:56,119 --> 00:14:03,379
in this expert advice section so the

00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,610
first lesson that we're learning from

00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:08,340
evaluating these competitors is

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,520
good content architecture makes it all

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,350
possible and that is a huge part of site

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,840
planning and if you are in web

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,520
development and design or you're working

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,650
with clients to create new web sites

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,540
like I find that this part gets missed a

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,590
lot and it is where all the future

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,570
opportunity is from an SEO perspective

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:30,900
all right let's digging the REI so this

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,490
I think is really fun so again if you

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,300
have questions or something's not making

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,180
sense you can ask along the way so here

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,530
what I want to look at is sleeping pads

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:46,050
so sleeping pads the keyword has 12,000

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,840
searches per month on average in the

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:52,110
United States and what we're seeing here

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,900
is that this sleeping pad article on REI

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,190
in their expert advice section earns

00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:01,680
about 12,000 visitors on average a month

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,260
because it appears for about 1600

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,330
different keywords and this is really

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,760
important because whenever you're

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,010
writing content you are not not for the

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,440
last many years are you optimizing for a

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,060
keyword phrase you are optimizing for a

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,160
topic and the more that you can

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,780
comprehensively cover that topic the

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,520
more keywords you appear in search

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,500
results for because honestly half the

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,670
time we can't even anticipate all the

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,190
different ways that someone's searching

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,280
but once we start digging into this and

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,900
getting some results you can then see

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,850
how are people getting to this and how

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,220
can we do a better job updating the post

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:40,710
to appear for that so sleeping pad they

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,040
appear in the second position in search

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,110
results this is the page so REI is

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,570
objective you know they want I'm

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,520
researching sleeping pads they want me

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,310
to buy one from them it's pretty clear

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,040
here's the page where that should happen

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,900
where the purchase is made one thing I

00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,670
want to point out is as they've

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,500
approached how they're organizing their

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,200
website and content on their website in

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,740
their shopping areas they're including

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:11,400
links to primary resource articles which

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,430
is helpful so these are the search

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,089
results for sleeping pads what we have

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:21,379
is of course for some ads

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:23,629
and then re eyes category page which is

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:27,470
this this is their actual product

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:29,029
category page is appearing first in

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,860
search results they're number one

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,790
everybody wants to be number one good

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,059
job and then further down like scrolling

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,360
down we make it to sleeping pads how to

00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:43,040
choose REI expert advice and that's in

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,110
their expert advice section it's not

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,120
part of their store it's the educational

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,360
content that they've created as part of

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,370
their net of how to build traffic to the

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,470
website and the reason I want to point

00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:00,949
this out is because even though the

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,010
product category page where the

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:06,319
conversion happens in terms of

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:10,669
purchasing a product is number one and

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:13,069
the educational page is number two the

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:16,730
educational post gets twice as much

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,649
traffic as the product section and

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,309
that's really important to underscore

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:25,760
because what it's about thinking about

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:29,179
the intent behind the searcher so when

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:34,809
I'm looking at search results I am way

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:38,600
more interested in something like this

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:40,549
that's how to choose the right sleeping

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,130
pad when I see that in search results

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,779
I'm way more likely to read about how am

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,490
I going to make this decision

00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:49,159
I need help making this decision and

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:52,029
then ultimately I might from this

00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:55,940
article click on here shop sleeping pads

00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:58,279
from their educational article because

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,890
now I'm an informed now I'm an informed

00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,049
decision maker but if I just see search

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,059
results that are just products and

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,070
people that are advertising themselves

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,720
is the best solution you see this a lot

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,669
for software company it's where they're

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,240
china advertise themself is the best for

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:16,399
XYZ but the searcher they don't want you

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,409
to tell them that you're the best they

00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:20,299
want to read an article that's comparing

00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:22,580
features are talking specifically about

00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,070
how those features will make their lives

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,659
easier that's speaking to the challenges

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,710
of walking through that like kind of

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,179
customer journey so i want to know

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,570
am I going to make the right decision

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,529
about the sleeping pad I want based on

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,480
all of these things that they

00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:40,110
anticipated by doing some kind of

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,909
content and keyword research which I'm

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,340
sure they've updated this all over time

00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,740
you know there's like charts it's really

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,750
long like this is great for search

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,990
results and there's no way that their

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,149
product page can ever comprehensively

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,549
cover the nuance of the decision making

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,770
process that me the end user might have

00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,820
what I'm trying to think about what kind

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,820
of sleeping pad do I want

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,359
yes

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,600
okay so that was the lesson there that

00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:23,900
product searches and again this applies

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,000
to services as well like software

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,530
companies software solutions anything

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,870
that is a product type

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,450
they're usually education seeking

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,830
searches first so when you're thinking

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,290
about the content that you're developing

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,540
for your sites of course you want to

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,370
optimize for exact services and exact

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,290
products that you offer just like REI

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,299
did but the strategy for building

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,650
Authority and traffic comes a step

00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,230
before that and those are those

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,280
educational components that can lead

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,799
someone to working with you but it's

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,720
also incredibly valuable and the more

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,490
valuable it is the more people interact

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,160
with it the more time people spend on

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,919
that page and the more the better you do

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:08,510
in search results so let's do another

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,580
one from REI so this is marathon

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,130
training like I said they have optimized

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,880
for absolutely everything related to the

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,900
Outdoor Industry

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:24,830
it's mind boggling so this marathon post

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:28,850
for marathon training they get ninety

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:33,679
five hundred visits a month on that one

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,929
post which is crazy and they appear in

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,210
search results for almost 3,500

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,400
different keywords for one article about

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,890
marathon training and you see that they

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,570
appear in the the rich search results

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,880
and what I'm showing you here on the

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:52,040
left is just the first like 15 of those

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,140
3,000 keywords that this one page

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,710
appears for so we see like the

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,419
variations of the phrase the position

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,419
that they appear in search results for

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,720
and this little quote means they're the

00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:09,049
rich search result the volume of each

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,610
independent keyword phrase so marathon

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,480
training is search ninety three hundred

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,490
times and then some things you don't

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,580
have a look at and then the resulting

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,460
traffic so this is how each individual

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:26,059
post each individual article is its own

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,340
net capturing traffic across keywords

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,770
that all contribute to building the same

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,750
and part of what I like about evaluating

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,970
competitors using these types of tools

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,799
is it gives you a sense for how they

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,169
started structuring content to

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,740
comprehensively cover a topic so

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:45,049
marathon training is about more than

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,690
just marathon training it's about how to

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:50,000
train how to prepare what's a schedule

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:56,840
look like like if we kind of click

00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:01,820
through let's see I can't so I haven't

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:04,190
kind of open here if I actually click

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,039
down on all of those keywords it gives

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,840
you a sense for what does that topic

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,020
really include so people are interested

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:15,110
in like what's a part of training how

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,330
long how to prepare sometimes it's how

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:20,919
many months and as we scroll through

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,390
this you start seeing how how

00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,610
comprehensively this article ends up

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,679
covering this topic based on all of

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,419
these keywords that it appeared for so

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,360
that's where content like after your

00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,250
content is live for a long time or a few

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,140
months even you can kind of go back in

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,610
and use tools like these are engaged

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,580
with kind of content development people

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,919
to analyze what is it appearing for and

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,080
now that we know could we better

00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,730
optimize it to appear higher in search

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,000
results for keywords that are it's

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,390
currently appearing for so for example

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,830
marathon training schedule for beginners

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,200
right now they're at the bottom of the

00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,260
second page of search results so 1 to 10

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,090
page 1 11 to 20 page 2 and if I was

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,210
going to say okay could we do a better

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,760
job I might say let's add a section to

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,610
this blog post that's specific for

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,620
beginners and maybe that'll do the job

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,440
and we can move up and capture more of

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,279
this 800 search volume because right now

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,279
we're only getting 9

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,440
okay so part of the lesson here is that

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,480
you have to produce a lot of content and

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,400
then see what rises to the top and I

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,200
know that's a difficult piece for a lot

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,550
of companies and sites especially when

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,290
you're smaller like how much time and

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,110
energy do you have to devote to content

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,820
and content development and my like a

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,740
rule of thumb if you are lacking in

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,310
resources if you can even just get out

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,500
to posts a month like at your minimum

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,450
that will make a huge difference over

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,100
the course of a year and then at the end

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,990
of that year you can dig in and evaluate

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,530
like what was the impact and how does

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,230
that work if you can invest more like if

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,390
you've got an REI budget go for it

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,160
because the more that you can do the

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,930
more you have to work with but it's not

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,090
until you actually get content out there

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,850
that you can begin evaluating it to see

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,890
what works so much of it no matter what

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,510
anyone tells you is like trial and error

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,150
especially because the search results

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,370
are so competitive so it can't hurt your

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,720
feelings if you write ten posts and one

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,910
of them doesn't really get any traffic

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,070
or it takes a long time you got to just

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,050
kind of keep doing it and then learn as

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,970
you go to see what's resonating and

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,520
what's what where you're starting to

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,380
build because like I said even with REI

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,810
if we look at there's thousands and

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,370
thousands of pages there's really only a

00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,840
handful that are accounting for the

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,790
majority of the traffic that they're

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,130
getting to their site and that is the

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:55,230
case for almost every site so another

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,910
lesson from REI so I've kind of wanted

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,360
to go it down so now we're looking at a

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:03,090
page on their site it's called rock shoe

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,590
care repair and if we look I mean part

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,330
of what's just fun about this is seeing

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,310
like the different things that they're

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,190
targeting and these are the top keywords

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,870
so you can tell from this the the

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,330
breadth and scope of the different

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:19,290
topics that they're writing about within

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:21,720
their blog so how to to put things into

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,250
some perspective there they're also

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,050
targeting keywords that don't have

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,070
nearly as much search volume you know

00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,710
some of the stuff they're getting

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,980
traffic on has 20,000 searches a month

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,500
but this is a topic that's 300 searches

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,510
a month how to clean climbing shoes and

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,710
they're not even in the first position

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,680
they're in the third position because

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,570
there's probably some rock climbing site

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,169
that's

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,419
more authoritative than REI is on

00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:50,450
dealing with your rock climbing shoes

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:52,940
but still in position with that they're

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,679
getting they're appearing for 344

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,389
keywords but they're only getting like

00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,210
about a hundred and fifty four visitors

00:25:56,389 --> 00:26:00,139
per month on that and that's fine I mean

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,799
that's great

00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:05,090
I mean especially for sites that have

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,259
conversions where one conversion is

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,409
really great

00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:14,629
like 354 visits or hundred visits a

00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:15,739
month on a blog posts is great so it all

00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:17,989
depends on kind of what you're offering

00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:19,849
there but what I want to point out -

00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:23,840
what they do is that here's cleaning

00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:27,499
climbing shoes and again we get to see

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,840
what does that topic really include like

00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:31,989
what does cleaning climbing shoes really

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,070
about and again this is really just

00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:36,109
demonstrating the exercise that should

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,299
happen when any content development work

00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:40,009
is occurring like what are all the

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,889
problems that people have why why is

00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:44,840
anyone googling how to clean rock

00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:47,359
climbing shoes like what are the common

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,599
challenges that they face when it comes

00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,549
to that exercise I mean I don't know

00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,009
what they are so that's why I just look

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,629
at the keywords I just you know spy on

00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:59,809
these other people to see what what they

00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:01,340
targeted so you know repair can you wash

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:05,840
the questions can you put them in the

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,669
washing machine probably and so that's

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,929
like the breadth of the topic and we see

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,269
in the search results

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,179
99 boulders is number one they have the

00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,700
rich search result and then we see REI

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,259
after that and what I want to point out

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,679
too is how this works how your

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:24,320
educational content contributes to this

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,320
prac to the overall optimization of your

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,059
site is that they're interlinking from

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,460
their blog posts so here it says rock

00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,379
climbing shoes how to choose so they

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,269
have another article on rock climbing

00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:38,419
like they have an article for every

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:41,539
aspect of what you could want to know

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,470
related to their core activities that

00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,479
are ultimately what they're selling

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,119
products for so they give you

00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:49,340
opportunities to learn more and they're

00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,840
linking to the actual product section of

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,840
the site where someone makes a purchase

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:58,460
so at the end game again and I brought

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,960
this up at the beginning but your

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,700
content and SEO based content strategy

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,430
is all about building that net of

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,520
traffic to your site across your posts

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:13,110
and pages and a conversion is not always

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,730
like people are you may not happen like

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,080
they might not buy something from you

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,360
they might not sign up for your email

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,460
but they will know who you are because

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,280
at the end of the day becoming an

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,770
authority is winning with your brand

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,870
it's like they know to search for you

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,760
and you have become pervasive on a topic

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:34,320
and so that actual conversion might take

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,030
place a lot later but again like this is

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,530
how that authority how you start

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,350
contributing and building those that

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:45,690
authority all right so I've got a half

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,340
an hour left I've got I'm gonna try and

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,840
link I'm gonna start going a little more

00:28:47,340 --> 00:29:02,760
quickly through these other sites and

00:28:48,840 --> 00:29:04,890
then at that s so this is yeah so this

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,680
is the part where it's like spam good

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,490
time access to features is a tool then

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,490
not everyone has

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:25,299
remember this is one of the lower tiers

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:28,570
um but there is a seven-day trial for

00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:30,160
seven dollars which is pretty useful but

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,890
that's part of what what I'm hoping

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,410
really out of this is that not everyone

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,809
is you know not everyone has the agency

00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:39,610
tools but I think what we can extract by

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,140
having like it this brief behind the

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,150
scenes of the stuff that we're looking

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,600
at and how we're making decisions about

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,940
content you can kind of internalize and

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,700
even if you don't have the tool or you

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,190
only have it for seven days it's about

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,860
like shifting the perspective of how we

00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:06,100
approach the purpose in the rationale

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:07,990
behind the content no no please okay

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,510
let's talk about meowingtons so

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,640
mountains appears in search results for

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,190
fifty eight point two thousand keywords

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,690
so not nearly as much as REI and they

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,250
get a whole lot less traffic than REI

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,320
but they're not as pervasive obviously

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:24,340
they're not as known so sixty four

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,919
thousand visitors per month and their

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,240
authority score is a lot lower so again

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,830
what I always would like to start with

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,270
is looking at how do they organize their

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,690
site like where do they put their

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:37,360
content and where are people arriving

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,669
the isn't like their category there's

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,340
shopping category pages so here you see

00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:44,140
that the majority of their traffic is is

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,910
on their home page it's people searching

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,290
for cat products like clothing for cats

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,380
cat themed clothing all that kind of

00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:58,990
stuff but we see that like of their

00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:02,350
traffic a little less than half is

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,840
coming in through their blog like this

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,660
is everyone's dream right like I have a

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,400
blog and people are arriving on it and

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,630
coming to my website learning about who

00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,880
who I am

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,210
so how did how did marrying tens do this

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,530
and because ultimately they don't a lot

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,450
of people what you're writing about in

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,919
your blog the endgame is that you're

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,410
building authority for the things that

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,790
you do that make you money and this is a

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,740
piece of that this is how you work

00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,710
towards that end game so we see that

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,070
like

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:35,720
top keyword that is not their brand name

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:37,460
is cat puns which is searched 29,000

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,779
times a month but they're they're not

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,159
even on the top of the first page

00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,919
they're at the bottom they're in the

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,720
ninth position of search results that's

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,730
the very bottom of the first page yet

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,529
there's still that's still one of their

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,470
top organic keywords and I think this is

00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:53,270
important to point out because of what

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,820
we're gonna learn about how they get

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:58,309
traffic being far down on the first page

00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,360
so where do they put this content the

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,450
user rate this is the user experience

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,039
part on their home page to get to the

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,840
blog you have to scroll all the way to

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,360
the footer their blog is in the footer

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,370
because people who are arriving on their

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,990
home page they don't need them to read

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,760
the blog they're you know who they are

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,429
they just want them to shop for like cat

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,730
pillows and stuff it the blog's sole

00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:22,610
purpose is for people to arrive on the

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,140
website from posts in their blogs so you

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,419
don't have to make it easily navigable

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,880
because people aren't going to be on

00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:33,490
tends to read blog posts about cat puns

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,490
they're going there to buy like cat pets

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,169
so this is the top content again this is

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:44,120
from the tool so what we see here is

00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:46,429
these are all of the pages in their blog

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,620
that are driving the most traffic to

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,929
their site so again it's the first few

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,450
that always contribute for the majority

00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,990
of traffic and what I'm looking at here

00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,230
is that they're writing blog posts on

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:03,230
different types of cats so is that gonna

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,360
convert maybe maybe not but what we saw

00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,490
earlier is as soon as you arrive on

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,440
their site they have these pop-ups with

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,940
these deals like free earrings if you

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,299
buy something so they're doing their

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,090
best job to try and make someone who

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,190
doesn't know who they are like a fan of

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,710
some kind that they can target later be

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,110
that on like social media or in an email

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,669
newsletter because if I'm just searching

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,169
orange tabby cat like I'm not

00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:30,980
necessarily the kind of person that's

00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:33,020
gonna like shop it meowingtons but I

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,520
could be so that's the that's the guest

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,780
part of SEO so let's look it so here's

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,320
orange tabby

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:45,440
cat and what I realized when I started

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,150
looking into that post so we see the

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,880
orange tabby cat they appear in the

00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:54,170
seventh position of search results right

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,020
down and this post appears for over

00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:00,320
2,000 keywords they get over 2,000

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,210
visits per month on this post so here's

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,710
the search results and when I explored

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,690
what are the different keywords that

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:10,850
they're appearing for related to orange

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:15,320
tabbies so we've got like are all cat

00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:17,419
orange cats male like wire orange cats

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,409
so affectionate people really asked a

00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:22,940
lot of questions about cats online well

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,440
part of what I want to show this again

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,020
for us to show the how the diversity of

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,090
a topic that this post is optimizing for

00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,060
and all those types of things that you

00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:39,110
couldn't could not anticipate that

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:41,450
people are searching for it's amazing so

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,650
what makes their post stand out in

00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,960
search results and what makes

00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,550
meowingtons really good at earning

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,380
traffic from search results even when

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,649
they're far down on the first page or

00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,330
they're not appearing higher up is their

00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:56,210
metadata and then this is their meta

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:59,090
title six things you didn't know about

00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,620
orange tabby cats and then we don't see

00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,970
the meta description in here but the

00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,670
metadata is what appears in search

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,950
results and that is so important the

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,020
metadata is what can inspire a user like

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:12,250
me to actually click on the post because

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,930
if it just said orange tabby cat facts

00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:17,630
like that's not nearly as exciting as

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,330
six things I didn't know I don't know

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,700
what I don't know I've got to find out

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,790
um and meowingtons does that across

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,160
their post they have really catchy

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:30,560
titles really catchy meta descriptions

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,440
and their content angles help their

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,750
results stand out in search results

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,700
against whatever else is there so that's

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,530
really important especially for blog

00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,090
writing and content work where you you

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,790
are competing you are expecting to earn

00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:47,390
traffic for an educational piece like

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:49,490
what is your meta title like an in your

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,320
meta description like for services

00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,110
companies a lot of times I recommend

00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,150
putting in put in your what makes your

00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:59,119
brand stand out maybe it's like a 30-day

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,890
free trial or maybe it's like in the

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,690
business for X amount of years or

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,820
something that would inspire yours to

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,080
get clicked on because if you're at the

00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,320
bottom of the first page of search

00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,630
results but everyone clicks yours you're

00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,470
gonna move up cuz it's part of how it

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,930
works because you're basically showing

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:19,760
Google that your good result and you're

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:22,550
what people want so that is huge and

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,280
here's another example to like of their

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:28,010
metadata 14 perfect puns for your pun

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,930
loving Valentine and then the other

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,090
piece I went into point oh you know that

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,340
looks that's just I would much rather

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,030
click on that then cat puns Reader's

00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:40,100
Digest

00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,869
I'm sorry fit reader's digest so even

00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,060
the in Reader's Digest is at first

00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,070
because their their site so much larger

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm sure like they have more kind of

00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,810
overall authority but meowingtons is

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,180
totally moving up in their company and

00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,440
in relationship is relatively new I've

00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,359
kind of been watching them for a long

00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,280
time like watching their growth and

00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:02,930
their ruling so the other thing I wanted

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,150
to point out here that we can learn from

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:09,980
these people is like timeliness matters

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:13,070
so it's February 14 2019 like it's a

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,150
Valentine's Day post about Valentine's

00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,150
Day cat puns

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,230
I didn't expect it I did not expect

00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,230
anyone to see my messy desktop I'm sorry

00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:42,920
um okay so timeliness matters so here's

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,240
a nonprofit campaign if we're gonna

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,250
continue through the different types of

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,020
examples of how people are using content

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,790
and SEO to make an impact on what their

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,700
business is supposed to be doing so

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:56,120
water use it wisely is and nonprofits

00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:01,250
like a group campaign to help educate

00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:04,160
people about ways of conserving water so

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,170
what does success look like for them you

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,670
know success for most nonprofit

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:13,910
campaigns is impacting policy it's like

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,710
you know educate awareness building yet

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,770
ultimately you know changing people's

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,530
hearts and minds and changing the world

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:24,320
which is really tough to do with SEO but

00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,720
anyway thirty point six thousand

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,490
keywords this campaign appears for they

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,870
get thirty three thousand visits per

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,390
month and they have a very high site

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:35,720
authority score which usually nonprofits

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:38,180
do so this is what their campaign looks

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,270
like and it's a coalition across like

00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,970
several kind of state and municipal

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:48,590
efforts so they have a hundred plus ways

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:53,140
to conserve water the reason I want to

00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:55,370
bring this up is because their objective

00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,320
if you could think of it from an SEO

00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,960
perspective water conservation would be

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,500
the primary topic that's the point of

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,430
the campaign but it's that type of thing

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:10,790
is very competitive but we see ways to

00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,530
conserve water has twenty 100 searches a

00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,130
month and they're in the third position

00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:19,490
and it's this campaign that is it

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:23,270
appears for 447 keywords they're getting

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:25,100
like 1400 visits but what happened for

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,490
them is they developed a site that

00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,670
allowed them to

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:33,360
prehensile II dig into all what those

00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:39,360
different types of ways are so a piece

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:41,330
of that is drip irrigation um and but

00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,040
xeriscape

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,960
designs and rainwater harvesting all of

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,600
these are subsets of ways of conserving

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,150
water and they're doing it by creating

00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,410
this URL structure that allows them

00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:59,970
within this 100 plus 100 plus ways

00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:02,670
format to create an amazing method for

00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,010
developing content on every type of way

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:08,070
of conserving water but it like looks

00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:12,000
good and it's fun and it's interactive

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:14,910
and it's super working for them so I'm

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,260
gonna go to that one so so one thing I

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,869
think is really cool about what they did

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,090
is that they're beating out in search

00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:26,340
results places like Lowe's and Home

00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:30,300
Depot and Amazon for things that like

00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,250
water irrigation system you're not

00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,600
really expecting nonprofits to appear in

00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,130
the search results for that you're

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,960
thinking it's gonna be large companies

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,960
that sell water irrigation systems and

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,250
are spending a lot of money on SEO and

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:47,000
optimizing because they want to convert

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:47,000
for that let's go

00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:56,860
so here here's that search result and so

00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,240
we see products you know whenever

00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,120
there's products appearing people are

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,540
paying money they want your dollars and

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,280
this is a nonprofit campaign so we do

00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,740
see Home Depot there and we do have to

00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,710
go down a lit a little bit but here they

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,570
are and part of what I think stands out

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,850
for them is when they're not like if I'm

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,500
looking for if I'm looking again a lot

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,300
of product searches are not actually

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,190
product searches they're people looking

00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,360
for more information so they can make

00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,240
informed decisions

00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:29,230
so water saving irrigation methods from

00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,650
a non-profit like it's gonna get a lot

00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:34,690
of clicks and it's super well done they

00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,060
create this great interlinking structure

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:39,850
they're like thoroughly covering the

00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:43,840
topic as a whole it doesn't look like it

00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:46,300
here but it works well on your phone and

00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,310
then you know some it's quite it's just

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,080
quite comprehensive and I don't feel

00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:52,180
like I'm being misdirected by being sold

00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,620
something I'm just doing education or

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,220
it's just educational work from a

00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,220
non-profit

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,510
so the lesson there is kind of to make

00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,800
it epic and again this goes into content

00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,900
planning as a whole like what I was

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,750
saying before about architecture and how

00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,300
how content works on your site it's

00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:21,940
super important that you come at that

00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,280
like like spend the time plotting it out

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,990
and something like this 100-plus ways of

00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,090
like you can tell so much thought went

00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,800
into that so like design development

00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:33,280
like URL structures like there was a

00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,410
plan for that entire thing and it came

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,170
together and people liked it like

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:41,230
interactive that actually the results of

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:44,200
that campaign it actually lots of other

00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,910
organizations linked to it because it

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,790
was so interactive and great for

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:51,940
education great for schools that act of

00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:54,910
how how comprehensive and well done it

00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:58,050
was earned them a lot of like press and

00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,050
in inbound links

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,750
um I didn't check if they had a hundred

00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:19,240
actual ones but yet so the hundred ways

00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,710
is one folder they have other sections

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,720
of their site I was just like focusing

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:27,309
on that singular campaign section but

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:35,529
you know we can look at it some more in

00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:38,650
the happiness bar oh right like is it is

00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:40,779
it a category um that's a good question

00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,309
because that does raise you know how do

00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:43,210
you approach it from an architecture

00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:46,299
section how do you make decisions

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:49,539
whether things are categories or tags or

00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:52,000
pages and that is a huge part of the

00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:54,910
planning process but I think it depends

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,799
on I mean obviously there are lots of

00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,470
factors like how much content do you

00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:03,630
think you're gonna create over time but

00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,630
I should let's look into it

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,130
okay so this is not a SEO content master

00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:14,170
this is a Content grasshopper so but I

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,660
wanted to give you an example of proper

00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,010
like a property management company so a

00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,599
lot of companies it might be difficult

00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,270
to think how do I have a content

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,839
strategy to go along with this type of

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:28,450
business that's useful and you know how

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,240
to approach it so real estate obviously

00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:34,869
is highly competitive and lots of people

00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,240
are trying to be in the same space for

00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:40,569
the most competitive keywords like for

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,250
example Asheville real estate or West

00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:46,299
Asheville real estate or anything in

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:47,920
Asheville plus any type of house but I

00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:49,510
wanted to not focus on Asheville so this

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,660
is a different area of the country with

00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:56,230
a lot lower search volume so it's a

00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:58,359
small site 3,000 organic visits 3,000

00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,190
visitors from search results per month

00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:03,339
and they only appear for like three

00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,650
point eight thousand so my say only

00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:07,450
that's so good it depends on what your

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,890
market is and how large your site is and

00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,240
what the search volumes are for the

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,309
things that you want to target like

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,890
small doesn't mean bad small could mean

00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,140
a maze

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,960
if there's a low search volume and

00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:20,329
that's exactly what you offer that's a

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,730
lot easier thing to do to optimize for

00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:25,970
that than something like REI that has -

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,759
that has all of that going on so for

00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:30,769
them again I wanted to just show how the

00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:33,230
blog functions so the majority of their

00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,880
traffic does come in on their pages of

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,249
their site that are related to real

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,809
estate in the region that's what they do

00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:41,390
that's where they're getting traffic

00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:43,339
that is great but how does the blog plan

00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,609
like when we're looking at SEO content

00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:49,369
strategies what does the blog do so the

00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:55,819
blog accounts for 20% of traffic to the

00:45:49,369 --> 00:46:00,309
site and there's 188 posts 38 of about

00:45:55,819 --> 00:46:03,140
3,800 keywords and about 3,000 visitors

00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:04,700
so this is what the site looks like and

00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,109
again I just want to point out again the

00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
blogs just kind of hidden because the

00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:09,769
purpose of the blog isn't that that

00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,690
people show up on your site and go read

00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,430
your blog you're using it in different

00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,200
ways it's appearing in search results

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,180
maybe you distribute it through social

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,579
media through your email but you don't

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,559
eat it like front and center because

00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:24,349
hopefully when someone's coming to a

00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,799
properties site you know what they're

00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:29,329
doing is looking at your your property

00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:31,700
so here are the top pages within the

00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:33,859
blog and again what we see is the

00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,980
traffic the amount of keywords that

00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:39,289
that's appearing for the actual post the

00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,869
top keyword driving traffic to that post

00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:44,329
the search volume of that keyword in the

00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:46,489
position that this site is in and so

00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,869
again like I like to bring these

00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:51,049
examples up because I think sometimes

00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:53,029
people get lost and thinking like if I'm

00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:54,619
a property company why would I be

00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:56,299
writing about finger-like if I'm a

00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,589
Finger Lakes property company why would

00:46:56,299 --> 00:47:00,200
I write about Finger Lakes Heights

00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:03,319
well it's because you got a lake remove

00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,690
yourself from in into the building brand

00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:07,039
awareness piece like if I'm someone

00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,680
who's searching for Finger Lakes

00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,420
breweries Seneca Lake boat tours Finger

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,019
Lakes hikes I'm someone who is

00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,759
researching a vacation in that area and

00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:19,400
if your site's there and you'll offer

00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:22,660
vacation rentals in that area well it

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,660
made it a little easier for me

00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,410
so again they're appearing in it's I

00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,930
think it's actually impressive that they

00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,640
appear for this search so it doesn't

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,560
have a lot of search volume but it's

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,120
important for the area like they want to

00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,920
do vacation rentals they're competing

00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,560
with all of the tourism authorities in

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,020
the area which most tourism authorities

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,060
and real-estate groups are often trying

00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:46,550
to target the same keywords and topics

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,990
and which is again why it's important to

00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,660
just kind of write about a lot of things

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,250
and see what starts to work but they

00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,770
appear in rich search results so this

00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,510
post is the where the majority of their

00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:02,060
organic traffic is coming from that

00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:03,680
isn't related to real estate so the

00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,900
thing I wanted to point out here is to

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,150
when you are writing the content like

00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,120
format it so you can and that's not

00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:12,740
really hard it's just kind of like

00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,340
sensical formatting like if you just use

00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:19,970
headers fall at points like it's pretty

00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:21,350
intuitive so this is what that post

00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,060
looks like and you see how Google

00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:28,360
scraped it out to appear in rich search

00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:31,880
results like it's not really complicated

00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,380
but it's doing a great job and probably

00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,390
what I would think is there's less

00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,430
competition in this area going on for

00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,870
these types of searches so this would be

00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,090
the type of posts where you might like

00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:43,670
come back to later and/or you get beat

00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,900
out because someone else because

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,270
ultimately like it doesn't look that

00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,650
great but it's a start and you got to

00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,110
start somewhere and if you don't start

00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,950
building traffic like you're not in

00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,950
you're not in the game

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,839
okay last one and then we're going to

00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:10,780
kind of summarize so dollar sprout is a

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,250
personal finance blog like this is a

00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,220
blog where the whole purpose is

00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,380
educational content it's like you know

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,060
the original bloggers dream like I'm

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,430
gonna build this blog and I'm gonna make

00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,020
a lot of money from it and they do and

00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,170
part of that is because of the amount of

00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,000
traffic that they earn so seven hundred

00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,430
and sixty-six thousand visitors a month

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,500
on two hundred and sixty two thousand

00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,630
keywords so what I want to point out

00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,670
with them is again it's the site

00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:42,700
architecture it's how did they organize

00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:45,010
content on their site so they have in in

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,770
there so they have this top-level their

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,349
core topics it's personal finance this

00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,420
is their homepage their core topics make

00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:54,550
money money management banking and

00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,950
investing what they have in here are

00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,720
some some of their top kind of content

00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,089
in it separated this kind of speaks to

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:05,220
it was brought up earlier they're

00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:08,560
linking both to pages and blog

00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,450
categories so they're trying they're

00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,760
experimenting with what is important for

00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:15,400
user have for users as well as what did

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:20,140
they want to target so this fast make

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:23,920
money fast is a blog category versus how

00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,540
to get out of debt which is a page so

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,950
basically when you're looking at how

00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,750
you're organizing content on your site

00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,720
especially if you're developing a lot of

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,630
content over time like it's really great

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,940
to sometimes the link to posts that are

00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:39,609
the most important or individual pages

00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,410
that are super important but also you

00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:44,200
can just link to categories like there's

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,599
so much you can do to make to merge like

00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,660
SEO decisions and user experience and

00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:52,780
how you put together your navigation so

00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:54,700
if I can let's just click on one so this

00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,890
is what their posts look like so how to

00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,089
invest a beginner's guide to investing

00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:03,070
in stock market

00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:04,510
and then they have the resources on the

00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,400
side like they just do a really good job

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:11,529
of organizing their content and

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:15,839
interlinking to other content and most

00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:15,839
specifically updating their content

00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,550
so what they have here is their top

00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,670
post-its

00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:33,190
work from home jobs which this is kind

00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:37,210
of mind-boggling to me like over like

00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:41,560
300 over 350,000 people search work from

00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:46,210
home jobs every month like that is a

00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:48,610
state and so this post appears in the

00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,800
seventh position organically but it's

00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:52,810
accounting for this whole post is

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,420
accounting for almost a hundred thousand

00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:57,610
visitors per month on their site like

00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,440
that's pretty amazing and if we look at

00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,120
their keywords across the board you know

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,370
how to make money fast make money online

00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,290
data entry jobs they've basically

00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,390
created a post to cover every aspect

00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,340
related to home finance or making money

00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,050
online and I'm sure they've been doing

00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,820
it for a long time because again they're

00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:15,100
an SEO master that started a long time

00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,590
ago it's the dream of the blog that's

00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,290
gonna make money but what it

00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,910
demonstrates is the like the diversity

00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,090
of topics that they've covered and

00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:28,660
created posts on so for example like

00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:31,000
birthday freebies so when you do like

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,620
kind of kind of content research or even

00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,770
blog research part of what you're

00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:38,530
looking for are these like random

00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:41,200
elements or seemingly random like

00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:44,770
birthday previews yes this is a part of

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,210
their like free money online that I

00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,910
would not have thought about but it's

00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:52,420
one of their top posts earning traffic

00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,620
to their site like you know it's

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,240
probably about where you get like free

00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:59,770
ice cream cones and stuff on your

00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:02,380
birthday and here's the the content

00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,940
itself so work from home jobs what I

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,340
want to point out again what I always

00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:10,270
like to point out is how they appear in

00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:13,090
search results so they are and I've

00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,890
noticed like looking into them they kind

00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,280
of they are experimenting with what

00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,470
they're

00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,290
titles and meta descriptions are to

00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:23,290
inspire greater click-through so the the

00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:26,620
meta title is 12 best work from home

00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:29,440
jobs hiring now earn 35 to 50 dollars an

00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,840
hour that's pretty compelling for a

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,510
click and this company's spending a lot

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,330
of money on blogging and content

00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:40,000
development and really sussing out the

00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:43,330
nuances of the difference in their meta

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,880
titles so big blogs like this some of

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,100
the best takeaways is looking at what

00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,480
are they titling their posts what are

00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,010
they doing in their meta descriptions

00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,110
because they're putting a lot of time

00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,610
and money into like a be testing those

00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,440
and seeing what inspires greater

00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:58,570
click-through rate so it's a great way

00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,130
of looking at how to evaluate your your

00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:05,050
own kind of metadata insights so the

00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:07,170
other thing that they do and if you are

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,040
relying if you have a few posts that are

00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:12,610
accounting for the majority of traffic

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,260
to your site update it like at least

00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,540
once a year and when you update it

00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:19,390
there's ways of like it can get an

00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,790
updated post and you should expand on it

00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,200
and that's the time to evaluate what is

00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,550
this supposed to parent what is this

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,170
post appearing for like how many

00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,480
keywords and what are those keywords and

00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:32,290
how can we realized it to better cover

00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,120
this topic so these are the kind of

00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,580
overall takeaways from evaluating these

00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,790
five different sites in terms of how to

00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,230
approach your own content work so first

00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,090
it's definitely paying attention to the

00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,160
architecture if you're redoing a site if

00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:47,290
you're building a new site even if

00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,020
you're just reworking your blog like

00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:51,670
what is the structure and how does it

00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,800
work from a user experience standpoint

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,510
but what did the folders look like like

00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,510
what types of content are you gonna be

00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:01,270
developing over time and then that

00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:02,830
compelling metadata like the title in

00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,200
the description that's appearing in

00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:07,780
search results it is it does it make you

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,420
want to click and then of course always

00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,580
inner link from your posts and pages to

00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,780
those core areas of your site where

00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,020
you're really trying to build the

00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:19,120
authority for what you do or offer

00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:22,319
update your content it's so much easier

00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,809
to update existing content to

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,099
do better then just start from scratch

00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:28,380
so you kind of want to be doing those

00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,959
things ongoing building new content and

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,940
editing existing content to do better

00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:36,449
and move up further in search results

00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:40,589
and then make it epic and of course make

00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:42,660
it up so the final piece I don't like

00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:45,509
part of what I wanted to expose here are

00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:48,059
numbers that most people don't get to

00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,519
see and don't have access to because I

00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:53,519
honestly think that that's what makes

00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,589
SEO really fun is looking at how many

00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,339
people are searching for random things

00:55:55,589 --> 00:56:00,989
like cat themed apparel and what did the

00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:04,259
search results look like for that and

00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:06,930
what are the related topics so because

00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:08,609
it is all about not just the key it's

00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:11,279
not just the keywords and it's not the

00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:13,410
search volumes it's about the topic and

00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:16,079
what you're solving for the that

00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:19,019
perceived intent behind the search of

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,729
what people are looking at and like how

00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:23,160
do you sort through that and figure what

00:56:20,729 --> 00:56:25,559
that out what that is and I think answer

00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,329
the public is a really great tool that

00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,640
can help you with your research it

00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:31,949
doesn't give you search volumes but it

00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,069
helps you understand all of the aspects

00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:37,799
of what a particular topic includes that

00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:40,109
allows you to create better outlines for

00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:42,150
content to target the breadth of a

00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:43,739
subject rather than like if you can only

00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,660
think of a couple keywords that seem

00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:47,819
relevant and then always always always

00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,789
google it like always google it and see

00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:52,920
what what is there you can get search

00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:56,279
volumes with Google Keyword planner it's

00:56:52,920 --> 00:57:00,150
very difficult to use and then there are

00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:02,279
for example answer the public a lot of

00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:05,130
keyword sites you can do like a one-off

00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:07,829
one-month thing where you can have paid

00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:10,079
you can pay for a month and get traffic

00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:13,140
but you can also work with agencies any

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,029
agency that does any type of SEO well

00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,039
usually you know that's a huge piece of

00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:19,829
it is looking at your keywords getting

00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,650
your the relevant keywords the search

00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:24,239
volumes if you see me I'm gonna be in

00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,590
the happiness bar for half the day

00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,890
tomorrow and

00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:30,690
we can always look at your top keywords

00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:34,500
your top five or you can kind of follow

00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:37,290
this link on here first for us to help

00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,870
you understand what your keywords are so

00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:50,850
yeah I've got like a two minutes if

00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:52,110
anyone has a burning question yes um the

00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,480
question was how important is blogging

00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:58,740
to drive traffic to your website so it's

00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,900
indirectly very important because and I

00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,480
say that it's indirectly because you do

00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,920
it over time to build authority on the

00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,570
areas of your site where you actually

00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,430
want people to arrive which are

00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,650
typically like service pages or product

00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:13,260
pages but you build that authority by

00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:16,490
writing content in your blog and Inter

00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,490
linking it to those pages

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,770
you got any other vital part of adding

00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,589
yeah so the question is like basically

00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,200
how to approach updating existing

00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:50,230
content so that you don't need to shoot

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:54,880
yourself in the foot um so yes don't

00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:56,799
change the URL don't do that um but I

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,450
think that's part of where it can be

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,490
tricky that's where it's like best if

00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,079
you can look at like where do you rank

00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:04,329
for the keywords that are driving

00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,390
traffic to that post and then make

00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:09,640
content edits and add new sections like

00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,500
the longer your post is online the more

00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,930
you have a sense for what's missing from

00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,089
it it might even be comments people make

00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,980
on the post are questions that they ask

00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:19,990
are things that came up on social media

00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,910
when you shared it anytime you're just

00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:24,430
adding extra content you're definitely

00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:27,279
not gonna hurt yourself but you can

00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:30,819
always add new resources like interlink

00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:33,760
to some new additional resources so you

00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:35,890
can't hurt yourself by adding don't

00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,750
delete a bunch of stuff and don't have a

00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:42,130
don't make it slower don't change the

00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:44,600
URL um thanks again I'll be hanging out

00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:52,280
