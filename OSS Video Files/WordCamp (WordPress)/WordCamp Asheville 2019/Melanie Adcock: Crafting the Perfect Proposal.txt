thanks charlie

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,700
um well thank you for coming to my

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,830
session I'm gonna start off by doing

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,320
something that you probably have

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,380
experienced okay you get a great lead

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,039
they actually even contact you about a

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,230
website you schedule a call you spend

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,320
like an hour talking to them they sound

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,309
like the perfect client it sounds like

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,460
the job is just perfect for you you know

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,640
how to do everything they want you're

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,040
excited about it you hang up with the

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,200
thing okay thank you very much I will be

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,149
sending you a proposal in the next two

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,910
days okay you're done and now it's you

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,289
got to write the proposal so what do you

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,420
do you check your email Oh need to do

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,660
this update for this other client let me

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,129
get this well I need to do this first so

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,330
you keep avoiding writing the proposal

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:13,140
you know it's a great job but you got to

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,960
write the proposal that was me probably

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,610
for the last five years

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,220
the first five years I was doing is

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,780
every every proposal felt like a

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,330
mountain to climb and so if you know me

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,299
for more than like a day you're gonna

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,360
figure out that I'm highly logical

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,520
I love the Star Trek theme by the way I

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,420
would be Spock I'm highly illogical I'm

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,610
highly analytical now that is controlled

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,189
contrast to the fact that I was an art

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,130
teacher for 18 years but I was the

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,500
anal-retentive art teacher so I had the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,149
cleanest art room in the county I had

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,320
excellent classroom movement so I love I

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,290
love doing the work I hated writing the

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,570
proposals so for me it was I've got to

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,540
figure out how to do this so I can

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,560
automate it so I can come up with a

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,470
system to write proposals in less than

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,900
30 minutes and they're going to look

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,659
gray

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,269
they're gonna stand out and so I started

00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,879
talking to people I talked to Chris I

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,689
mean we're talking like seven or eight

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,970
years ago I am the one of the very first

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:32,650
word camp sessions I went to was how to

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,930
make six figures in in web design and he

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,269
talked about proposals but nobody could

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,390
give me a template I need a template I

00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,920
need somebody show me how so I started

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,549
that was one of my things I started

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,440
collecting templates then I joined WP

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:53,859
elevation for well this August will be

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,209
five years ago and what was he giving

00:02:53,859 --> 00:03:00,639
away a website proposal template so that

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,019
started it I'm like great then I got a

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,700
personal coach who had his own website

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,409
template so I kind of merged the two and

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,439
I'm gonna show you an example of that

00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:15,700
today but I started collecting and I

00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:19,989
have now using an online tool have a

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,549
proposal setup I have templates I do a

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,459
lot of retirement communities so I have

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,620
a retirement community template I do a

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,500
boatload of churches so I have a church

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:34,510
template I have a small business

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,430
template and speaking of coach's mind

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,919
just walk in Nathan Ingram in the back

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,040
if you need a business coach please see

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,699
him this weekend so I am going to go

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,849
I've talked about why let's see who I am

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:51,849
I'm the : ER of Adcock creative group my

00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,709
husband and I started Adcock creative

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,540
group we actually started two

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,169
independent businesses he's a graphic

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,739
designer

00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,449
handles mostly print and I do the web

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,190
part but we kind of did separate

00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,949
businesses we both got laid off on the

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,199
same day about eight years ago we

00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,709
started our own businesses we've merged

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:15,190
and became Adcock creative group and

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:18,699
I've been a freelancer for over nine

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:22,479
years full time and of course I'm the

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:25,419
speaker a lot of work camps so and I

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,310
told you the why I hate writing

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,650
proposals it's like one of the things I

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,940
do

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,500
the most and then let's talk about the

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:38,630
difference between a proposal and a

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,110
quote a quote is like a menu I'm it's a

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,060
list of things that you can choose from

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,720
here's an invoice this is what I'm going

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,110
to list it's like a laundry list but a

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,210
proposal is going to present you as a

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,740
professional I know what I'm talking

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,350
about and this is what I'm going to do

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,510
for you these are the benefits of hiring

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,910
me and so it gives you a lot more space

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:08,449
to not only impress the client but

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:12,610
explain your processes what you will do

00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:15,470
what you won't do and kind of you know

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,500
cover your rear end on a lot of other

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,510
things it presents the value and that's

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,810
the big thing about proposals you want

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:28,090
to say if you hire me you're going to

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:32,060
get this value okay what not to include

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,440
don't use any technical terms I think I

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:39,410
mentioned WordPress twice in my proposal

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,150
don't list by name don't box yourself in

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,370
because you might find something better

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,830
on down the line and they're like well I

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,990
thought we were going to use this you

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,580
don't need to listen list plugins by

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,130
name doesn't mean you can't talk about

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,789
them down the road especially if they're

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,250
premium plugins don't itemize costs

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,550
unless you're breaking it down into

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,260
phases if you say I'm going to do this

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,430
this this is going to cost you and

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,229
they're going to and you've got a penny

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,330
pincher as a client they're going to

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,830
come back and cross things out and say

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,139
well I really don't want you to use

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,090
gravity forms I want you to use contact

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,120
form seven because it's free you know

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,280
and just they're going to you get some

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,910
that nitpicks so avoid that nitpicking

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,310
by not itemizing just say this is the

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:30,199
value I'm going to give you and here's

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:33,740
the price what to include this is a long

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,200
list okay don't worry there's a link to

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,190
the slides at the end a business

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,460
snapshot what a business snapshot is I

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,130
listen to you

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,020
when you told me about your business so

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,320
you're you're actually going back and

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,570
telling them what they told you we are a

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,360
full-service retirement community we

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,000
handle independent living all the way to

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,420
skilled nursing and memory care we have

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,660
everything in between we have cottages

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,550
we have apartments all the way from one

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,330
bedroom to three bedroom apartments and

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,280
we have all these amenities so you're

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,160
actually just telling them what they

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,620
told you you go to their own website you

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,080
look up up things about them and you

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,230
actually just say hey this is your

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,140
business and this is what we're going to

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,850
do for you and business needs and target

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,970
audience needs these are questions you

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,070
ask when you talk to your client why do

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,540
you need a new website what are you

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,490
looking to improve on your current

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,430
website

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,290
what are features your current website

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,840
doesn't have and that you want to have

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,900
what are things that you have that you

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,210
want to get rid of who's your target

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,020
audience tell me about the demographics

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,350
you know are they middle aged men who

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,660
like to hunt and fish or are they you

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,220
know Millennials or Generation X you

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,980
know you've got to ask about that

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,410
demographic so you know the design of

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,620
the website is going to match that

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,810
demographic the scope of work you know I

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,840
know this is a no-brainer you're going

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,030
to write exact line items this is what

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm going to do not how you're going to

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,420
do it but this is what I'm going to do

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,670
it's going to have an email opt-in form

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,310
you know it's gonna have a social media

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,650
stack you're going to be able to like

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,120
them on social media or follow them on

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,400
social media but you're also going to be

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,440
able to share it on social media you're

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,020
gonna list everything down and I'm going

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,180
to show you example that investment

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,870
notice I didn't say price because there

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,480
in making an investment in their website

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,210
it's a financial investment so that's

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,870
what I call it and here are the pricing

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,690
options so I'll show you an example of

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,000
that your process

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,250
you know I don't hide that okay first we

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,060
do design I know this is a real basic

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:06,209
but first we do design and then we do

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,990
development and then we do launch and

00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:12,480
here's the approximate time it takes

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,660
notice we have the design but we can't

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,920
do any work until we have your content

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,600
so no no code before content so we have

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,490
to have your content at this point

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,410
that's actually in my face if we don't

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,129
have your content the project's going to

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,110
stall here until we do and then we go

00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:34,699
into development and then we launch and

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,769
then we do the post launch so and

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,899
contract I actually have my contract

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:42,329
included in my proposal now some people

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,540
send them separate I think I like my

00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:48,420
clients to see all the small print at

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,889
the same time and I you can put it in a

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,610
separate document and send it at the

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,740
same time okay

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,470
here's the key let the client write it

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,610
if you know what your proposal needs to

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,620
include you know what questions to ask

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,649
so I just ask them all the questions

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,259
that I need to fill in the blank on the

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,589
proposal so I have a list of questions

00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:16,019
like I have a church list I have a

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,079
retirement community list if I've done

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:23,430
more than two questions and our two

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:25,319
websites in a specific vertical market

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,439
like insurance I have an insurance

00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:29,819
website thing because I've done three so

00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:31,769
I actually have a list of things that I

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,130
ask people who want an insurance website

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:38,069
so I just save those questions pull them

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,800
back out I actually on my website have a

00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:43,769
website worksheet courtesy of WP

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,500
elevation and I actually have people

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,569
I've never heard of fill out that

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,259
website worksheet all about their

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:54,930
company and contact me then I schedule

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,059
shocks me every time I get one but you

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,730
know oh I heard from me about you from

00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,850
someone else and I want you to do my

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,740
website so it actually asks all the

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,870
questions that I would ask him if I was

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,490
talking to them on the phone tell me

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,920
about your target audience tell me

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,720
your business needs and you're welcome

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,970
to go to my website and look at it and

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,970
tweak it make it your own I just have it

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,470
up there I don't force my clients to go

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,280
and fill it out I'd much rather have

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,440
that phone conversation I don't write a

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,100
proposal if I don't have a chance to get

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,290
the project I used to be afraid to talk

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,510
money you know you know what's your

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,430
budget you know how much do you think

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,320
you willing to spend I you still say

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,510
that to the very last after I spent an

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,940
hour on the phone it's like the third

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,170
question I ask you know what's your

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,770
budget for this project and if it's if

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,180
they say you know I want it's $500 I'm

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,770
not gonna say well I'm not going to do

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,840
it for that I'm gonna well let's

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,360
continue talking and then I'm gonna tell

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,640
you I tell you that my base website

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,810
starts between four and six thousand

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,600
dollars now let's talk and let's find

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,420
out your needs and then I'm going to

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,450
point you in the right direction usually

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,950
by the time I finish talking to them

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,990
about what they would get for that money

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,580
and I'm talking to them about their

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,640
business and what their desires and

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,080
goals are nine times out of ten I'm

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,880
gonna send them a proposal and they're

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,650
gonna sign it because they're gonna

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,930
realize they don't they probably have

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,180
unrealistic expectations if they really

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,190
don't have the money then I'm going to

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,640
say well you know maybe Squarespace and

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,250
Wix are the best for you for right now

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,030
but when you're ready to grow your

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,860
community you're ready to really take

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,810
advantage of having a fully functional

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,220
website then you can come back to me in

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,050
a couple years when you have a larger

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:59,370
budget and I've actually had that happen

00:12:52,050 --> 00:13:00,780
so okay here's the proposal I already

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,750
talked about that but I'm going to talk

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,510
about actually all the steps in my

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,850
proposal I have the business snapshot

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,380
the business needs the audience needs I

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,680
have the solution I call it a solution

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,720
scope of work my investment my agreement

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,930
and then the next step where they can

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,150
sign and go on with the project

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,430
so

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,650
let's go back I'm going to show you an

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:32,970
example here so let me escape this and

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:36,779
go to my template now I use better

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,460
proposals and I was using bid sketch it

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:44,370
was like thirty dollars a month at the

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:47,160
time I was using it and appSumo if you

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,180
don't know about app app sumo appSumo

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:55,110
calm go there sign up get their emails

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,089
they have a lifetime deal for better

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,750
proposals for $39

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,910
I can send like 30 or 50 proposals a

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,620
month like you know that's not going to

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:10,110
ever happen so at least not the way I'm

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,000
set up right now so I got a lifetime

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,100
deal so you know I don't have to pay a

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,080
monthly fee but there's other great ones

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,490
out there and I'll talk about some of

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,600
those tools in a minute but I'm going to

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:25,380
show you a sample proposal this is

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,900
actually the one I use for my retirement

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,589
communities and what I did is I put name

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,330
of community in bold and I have to tweak

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,940
it for each community but I have this

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,720
the business snapshot which talks about

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,640
their community they need an updated

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,339
website that functions as a powerful

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,800
marketing communications tool to attract

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,839
new residents position the website is a

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,930
go-to source of information and position

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,560
name of community as a upscale option in

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,540
the senior living market and then I

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,070
actually have the business and target

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,770
audience needs and these this is the

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:07,459
bullet list of the things that they

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:10,080
don't have on their current website and

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:15,440
the things they told me that they wanted

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:18,600
on the phone they needed an event system

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,510
and this one they actually needed they

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,089
did know basic SEO they had their

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,220
website their current website was on

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:30,120
GoDaddy site builder so there's like no

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,420
SEO there's they haven't done anything

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,270
they haven't done any blogging but they

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,530
want to

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,240
they don't have floor plans because they

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:42,940
don't know how to upload them there was

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,620
they wanted to do online donations there

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,000
was a bunch of things that they didn't

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,930
have that they wanted they knew they

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,090
needed an SSL certificate and then who's

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,070
their target audience well with like

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,920
retirement communities you have a weird

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:01,120
target audience first you have the

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,770
usually 75 years old and older are the

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,020
people that like put themselves in

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,880
retirement communities they don't start

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,030
thinking about it until like at the last

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,630
minute then you have their kids that are

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,060
you know in their 40s maybe 50s who are

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,360
looking for a place for mom and dad or

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,980
you may even have their grandkids who

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,930
are taking care of them and looking for

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,800
a place so you have a wide gamut so you

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,290
actually do all the marketing use Direct

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,410
Mail you use newspaper ads you use all

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:37,450
this other stuff and so I put that

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,270
actually in the target audience needs

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:43,030
and this is the weird one no means over

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,310
here and then the solution this is what

00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,410
I'm going to scope of work this is

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,450
everything I'm going to do for you I'm

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,660
going to do a custom design

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,530
mobile-friendly

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,640
I'm going to reorganize your they're not

00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,380
all going to be at the route we're gonna

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,560
actually do a content silo we're going

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,360
to do a page builder we're gonna do

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,520
social media we're going to do email

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,640
sign up and on and on and on and on

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,530
basic search engine optimization now

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,510
first of all most people have never

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,660
heard of search engine optimization so I

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:19,270
put basic and then I actually at the

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,400
bottom I explain to them when I go over

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,260
this with them on the phone what basic

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,550
search engine optimization is that means

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,220
we're going to optimize your page that's

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,470
for every page for search engines so we

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,390
can customize what shows in Google and

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,760
everything it does not mean it's

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,660
competitive search engine optimization

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:45,220
we are not doing ads we are not going to

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,670
make you rank number one for assisted

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,120
living

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,860
okay that's competitive search in

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,290
optimization that's advanced search

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,030
engine optimization not included so I

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,830
don't let them get the misunderstanding

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,170
that they're going to be number one on

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,230
Google when they get a new website

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:04,740
I also offer hosting I try to get my

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,390
clients on my hosting simply because

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,430
it's an environment I can control and

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,900
make sure everything's working correctly

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:16,920
in my project timeline design

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:21,270
development revisions testing and then

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,040
launch and then the investment you know

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,559
what is the investment and then I put in

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,410
the options I put in the options for

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,900
hosting I put in the options for website

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,570
care plans I want to take care of their

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,640
website when it's when it's launched so

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,040
I talked to them about the different

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,910
options and the care plans do you want

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:45,120
to basic $99 a month that I just handled

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,910
the security the backups and some minor

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
updates do you want me to do more than

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,710
that at $2.99 a month do you want

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,730
concierge priority care starting at

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,650
$4.99 a month so I explain the

00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:05,940
differences I actually even have it in

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:08,190
my contract which is my master services

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,980
agreement now I put all these little

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,490
headings in the slides so you have it

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,260
but this is kind of a the legal thing I

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,980
am NOT a lawyer I don't play one on TV

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,410
so you should have a lawyer look at it

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,720
the best way to do that write something

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:28,700
up and take it to them and have them

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,559
tweak it find somebody who's good with

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,230
digital businesses I talked about the

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,080
services the time frames here's time

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,540
frames if you don't give me content I

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,090
can't bid your let build your website so

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,530
if you want us to write the content and

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,380
then we'll include that in the time

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,490
frame but when people say you know they

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,960
give you the money and then they

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,550
disappear for a month and come back and

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,740
ask where the website is and you're like

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:56,520
well where's the content here's

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,760
something I got from Nathan suspended

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,530
and abandoned projects you do a project

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,690
the client disappears

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,010
for about six months then they come back

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,200
they're gonna they want to get the

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,240
website launched in a week you make the

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,430
final tweaks that they want boom and

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,560
then they vanish again so I actually

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,910
have a suspended if I don't hear from

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,510

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,620
I mean crickets nothing I don't hear

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,750
anything from you

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,130
the project is suspended we're gonna

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,980
pick it back up you're gonna pay the

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,790
second half before I start working

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,380
because I'm gonna make sure I'm gonna

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,270
get the money for this project because

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,210
you've just showed me what kind of

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,000
client you probably are abandoned

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:39,260
projects you don't hear from them in 120

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,510
days 90 days whatever number it is

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:46,290
projects done dead if they come back to

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:49,920
you it's a new proposal because we're

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,980
starting from scratch again fees and

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,690
payments how are they gonna pay you that

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,850
30% 30%

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:04,100
you know 33 33 34 5050 you write it up

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:07,680
let them know currently our hourly rate

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,630
it's not listed here but it says hey I

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,460
did this website for you four years ago

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,700
when I was charging hundred dollars an

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,110
hour and you want me to do some hourly

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,490
work now well it's going to be the

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,840
current hourly rate not what you had

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,570
four years ago

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,010
what's your late payment Oh your check

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:34,650
bounced things like that termination you

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:38,370
can fire clients it's okay I've done it

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,320
refunds if you don't have a refund

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,500
policy that's the number one thing I

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,060
assign for you to do do you really want

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,570
to do a bunch of work and then give them

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:52,260
their deposit back no so if they decide

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:55,650
to go with somewhere else you have a no

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,220
refund policy I actually discover my

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:02,010
what my design process is what my

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,460
development process is what what

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,190
constitute revisions revisions isn't oh

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,390
by the way I want to commerce store

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:15,480
that's not a revision okay what launches

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,100
okay this one actually came up yesterday

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,830
compatibility our websites are designed

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,490
for modern browsers if you're using

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,860
Internet Explorer 10 I can't guarantee

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,650
that it's going to work for that it's

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,240
not built for that so I actually got

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,010
that question from a client

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,790
hey this isn't working in Internet

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,200
Explorer don't like Internet Explorer

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,559
can you tell me what version it is by

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,450
the way

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,559
oh they're using Internet Explorer 10 I

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:50,130
said is it on Windows XP oh you know I'm

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,660
like okay well it's probably never gonna

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,870
work on that here's the directions go to

00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,030
Chrome and download Chrome and see hope

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:03,120
that it works on that and the next thing

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,679
is you know upgrade your computer and

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
then changes after launch

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,630
that's tweaks what's covered it's not oh

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,360
by the way I need a business directory

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,799
on my website that is not included and

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,990
use of third-party images and

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,900
photography second most important thing

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:26,220
to have in your contract I actually

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:31,080
asked my clients where did you get this

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:34,590
picture and well I googled it I but I

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,220
googled copyright free and it was on it

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,880
no we're not gonna use that I actually

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,070
include stock photography in my designs

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,900
I have a subscription to I stock and I

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,940
buy the credits for deposit photos so I

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,890
include those some people charge them

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,820
extra like $10 extra for every stock

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:55,440
image but I don't want that information

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,110
coming back I don't want my clients

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,419
getting nailed by Getty Images because

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,270
they they Snite something off of Google

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:07,110
and so this is something I actually got

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:10,140
from Nathan Terms of Use and other legal

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:12,480
pages worse we should have every website

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,919
should have a privacy policy should have

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,919
it if it's got an e-commerce store

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,380
should have a terms and conditions who's

00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,690
responsible for writing that I put on

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,610
there I will do a basic one for you and

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,190
I will email the text to you

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,360
it's

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:31,410
to you to go to your legal advisor and

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,570
make sure that that covers your business

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,730
who owns what I mean WordPress is

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,890
open-source they've got to understand

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,720
that they can use this website site

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,670
design is for this website

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,730
they can't package it up and sell it for

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,730
some something else plug-in licenses and

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:53,200
updates if you're on the care plan with

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:55,030
me I cover premium plugins if you decide

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,550
not to be on the care plan with me I'll

00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:02,410
cover that plug-in for one year I set a

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:04,330
note on my calendar and then it's not

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,180
covered anymore they have to buy their

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,590
own and I actually have an email I send

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,810
them all by the way you're not on a care

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:16,110
plan it's your responsibility to get a

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:18,580
new license for this website security

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,920
who's responsible if something happens

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,790
to the website if I they're not a care

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:28,300
plan you know it's their responsibility

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:30,220
talk a little bit about my hosting that

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm not responsible if they go with the

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,050
you know Bob's hosting I actually have

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,350
some clients who when I first got them

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:41,290
they were on the local computer repair

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,970
places web hosting you know and it

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,710
didn't even have the GDR library

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,660
installed so you know you're trying to

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,240
do WordPress on something that can't run

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:52,360
the WordPress website updates and

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:57,220
backups you know I set up some automated

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,790
backups for them just so I can make sure

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,680
I at least have a copy of the website

00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,220
but it's up to them

00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,550
website care plans I talked about that

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,890
here's my packages and then payments for

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,630
care plans if you want to I have a few

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,310
clients because of their internal

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,990
billing have to do checks

00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,170
I don't mind checks I don't have to pay

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,200
credit card fees but if you're going to

00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,850
do checks I bill quarterly for that so I

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,850
don't want to be responsible for sending

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,290
you an invoice every month it's just not

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,760
something I want to do I don't want

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,050
these little checks coming in so if

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,030
you're going to do a check we do it

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,550
quarterly nobody which seems to have a

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,610
problem with that most the time we just

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:43,120
it up with a credit card third party

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:46,720
services I do a lot of churches third

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,910
party services online giving live

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,160
streaming you know we're gonna make it

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,840
work the best we can but there's you

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,790
know their limitations are usually on

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,470
that third party system email

00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:01,600
deliverability I use mailgun I set up a

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,450
I work with them we set up a mail gun a

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,790
free mailgun account we connect every

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,280
website do that with mail guns so we

00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,450
don't have an issue with mail

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,060
deliverability so when I get a client

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,540
that says hey you know someone said they

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:20,050
sent me a form yesterday at 9:30 this

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,090
happened and I didn't get it so I go I

00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:25,320
log in to mail gun and I look at it and

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:30,210
I said well you opened it at 9:30 9:30 -

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,590
on your computer I did oh here it is I

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,690
accidentally put it in the trash so I

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,350
love the logs on mail gun so I can

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:42,100
actually say hey you know it did go

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:44,560
Disko closure domain names hey if you

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,160
don't pay your domain registration it's

00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,270
not my fault that's your domain last

00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,470
I've had that happen before

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:56,410
so I actually when I do the DNS I look

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,570
and see when it expires and I actually

00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,330
put a note in my calendar for my client

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,860
you know their domain is expiring send

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,850
them an email make sure that they're

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,030
going to pay the bill because I had a

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:13,780
client who confused web hosting with

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:15,370
GoDaddy and domain renewal and so I just

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,800
wanted to make sure that didn't happen

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,800
and they're like do I pay this and I'm

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,540
like well what does it say domain no you

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:27,390
pay that marking an attribution link

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,830
indemnification you know what are you

00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:34,990
responsible for something horribly goes

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:37,690
wrong choice of law and forum if your

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,600
client in Nevada decides to sue you for

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,970
some bizarre reason do you really want

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,460
to have to go out to Nevada no they have

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:48,450
to come to Georgia or they have to come

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,929
to North Carolina to deal with that so

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,899
disclaimers

00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:55,869
this is all you know legal stuff and

00:28:52,899 --> 00:29:01,090
then this is stuff that lawyers will add

00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:04,419
and then I have my next steps and they

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,340
just go ahead they sign it better

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,139
proposals has the option that you can

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,110
they can actually pay right then you can

00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,220
turn that on and off as needed if I have

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,740
that client saying we'll send you a

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,059
deposit check I turn it off but others

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,240
they'll just say I want to pay by credit

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:21,549
card I want to get SkyMiles for it so

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,110
I'm going to pay for credit card and I

00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:25,240
just turned that feature on and they

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,029
sign it the neat thing about like bid

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,730
sketch propose off' i'd better proposals

00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:35,619
is every time the client opens the

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:38,649
proposal you get an email you get to see

00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:41,350
how much time they spend on each page so

00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:44,049
they spent you know approximately five

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,669
seconds on the contract i know that when

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,769
i talk to them over the phone that i'm

00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,909
going to say now i noticed you didn't

00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,889
spend a lot of time breeding the

00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:53,259
contract let's kind of got a brief

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:55,019
overview of what it says so you kind of

00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:59,470
know what you're getting yourself into

00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:04,899
so let me go down here and bring that

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:07,059
back there we go and that's kind of

00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:09,850
that's why i put this in here because

00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:13,269
that way you'll have an example of

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:16,119
what's in the proposal and this is all

00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:19,720
the main points in the contract that we

00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,360
just went over the notice i put first

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,279
have your lawyer look at it timeframe

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,100
suspended and abandoned projects all

00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,289
that that we just went over so now you

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,169
have a nice list because you can

00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:34,330
download these slides to tools for

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,340
proposals hey if you're just starting

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,200
out and you don't have a lot of money

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,039
you don't have a lot of margin to work

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,009
with use word or pages take an example

00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,919
and just build it in Word or pages pages

00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:50,200
I use better proposals and there's a

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,200
affiliate link I hardly ever do that but

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,789
I put that there bid Sketch is nice

00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,649
between the two they're very similar but

00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,980
I found better proposals easier to

00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:01,639
customize propose if I I just saw a

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,309
proposal I'm working with

00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,349
their web design web designer and we're

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,909
doing a big project together and she did

00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:10,009
hers and proposed by she did the

00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:12,919
proposal it was gorgeous

00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:16,389
so proposed off' is another one and i've

00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,700
seen that on appSumo as deals as well

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:24,559
seventeen pounds seventeen hats is kind

00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:27,649
of an all-in-one solution payment emails

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,049
a whole bunch of automation now they're

00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:34,309
kind of pricey they just have a sale a

00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:36,139
couple weeks ago but put it put a note

00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,119

00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:40,669

00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,200
friday sale every year

00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:49,039
pluto is one that was another appSumo

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,169
deal it was a project management tool

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,159
but they've added proposals to it I got

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:58,369
that on appSumo and I've been waiting

00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:01,519
it's kind of like Trello meets better

00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:03,259
proposals meets asana kind of thing it's

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,419
up kind of he's keeps adding features

00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:10,279
and he added a proposal feature and they

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:12,799
just they're in beta right now this is

00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:15,859
what I've been waiting on it's going to

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,809
connect to zapier so I can actually

00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:20,539
connect it to everything else right now

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:22,899
it's kind of stand-alone so I'll

00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:29,479
probably move over to it from Trello

00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:32,539
once zapier is integrated and then guide

00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:35,149
the client go over offer to go over the

00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:37,639
proposal if you're in a different time

00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:39,379
zone then record a video and talk your

00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:43,429
way through the proposal and send it to

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:45,799
them and you get the deposit before you

00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:48,919
do any work no matter how excited you

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:51,649
are to do it always get the deposit

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,779
first because what if they did well we

00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:56,509
decided to go with my cousins nephews

00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:59,059
neighbor to do it because he can do it

00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:01,009

yeah if you're if you're doing any extra

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,930
service that's not covered by what

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,670
you're doing and it's an extra fee for

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,670
service you need to put that in there as

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:28,930
kind of almost an additional section and

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,390
I'd even highlight it and make sure that

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,790
I talked to them about it and so they

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,040
understood that if it's an additional

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,270
fee for service that you're you're you

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,790

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,550
the insurance company you need to put

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:48,780
