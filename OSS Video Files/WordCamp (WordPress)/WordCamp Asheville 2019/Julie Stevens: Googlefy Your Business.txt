thank you all for sticking around for

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,519
the last session of the day so I do

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,760
appreciate you doing that and being here

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,630
I'm Julie Stevens with RMS tech spa out

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,119
of Charlotte and in my company we take

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,500
these stress out of tech so that's our

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,019
motto and I do help with words our

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,809
websites and help folks with social

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,140
media do technical training that kind of

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,329
stuff so I'm always busy learning

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,540
something new to be able to help my

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,860
clients with that so I want to just

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,309
start by explaining what my word camp Y

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,980
is and I added this because of the

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,629
sessions that I've gone to for myself at

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,649
work camps I've always wanted to hear

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,420
this when prisoners are presenting so I

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:04,860
found this graphic and I thought it was

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,380
super cool to explain why I love being

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,869
here and so we've got the brain here

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:15,330
which all our brains at this point are

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:17,790
enormous I'm sure and so I'm here to

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,049
fill my brain but I'm also here to fill

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,549
my heart I've been in sessions the last

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,350
couple of days that have actually

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,750
brought tears to my eyes from stories

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,909
that people have told I've met wonderful

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,009
people here and thank you for some of

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,670
you that I've met in the last couple

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,430
days that are here today so my heart is

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,299
also very full when I leave here and

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,810
then those two things together create

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,130
those ideas and so when I walk away I

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,200
hopefully will take something that I

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,720
learned here and transform it into

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
something I can use for myself or for my

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,360
business so I hope that you all have

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,490
similar feelings as well I do want to

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,250
mention now that we're truly officially

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,260
started that at the top I do have a

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,720
Google link and

00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,060
I have questions on my screen that will

00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,660
pop up so if you have questions along

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,820
the way and want to type them in there

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,060
you're welcome to or so your hand up in

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,920
the air

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,810
either way very you know you don't have

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,990
to wait till the end if something sparks

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,060
in your brain go ahead and ask me so

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,620
just a little bit about me here are some

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,110
photos I that you've got a picture there

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,170
in the middle of me and my husband we

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,180
does a surprise wedding two years ago

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,830
and surprise all the people in

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,050
attendance with that wedding so that's

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,440
why we're rushing there in our picture

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,870
so that was super cool I love the lake I

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,670
have a little place on Lake Tillery and

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,080
that's where I spend most of my weekends

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,480
I've got a Harley

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,100
I like riding motorcycles as well and

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,170
then down here at the left are my two

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,190
daughters that's us in Costa Rica we

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,990
none of us had had a drink out of a

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,970
coconut before so we had to drink true

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,680
coconut water out of a coconut and they

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,380
thought it was the coolest thing ever so

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,670
that's just a little bit about me one

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,959
other thing to note that I forgot to

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,880
mention all of my slides are on the work

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,340
camp Ashville website so if you want to

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,560
access some of these slides they are

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,290
there linked and then this brings me to

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,570
my real love of my life which is food

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,680
okay the picture up at the top left is

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,250
from I've been talking about it about

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,989
everybody I've met so far a biscuit head

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,260
anyone eating that biscuit head in

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:41,320
Asheville fantastic so I went there

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,830
yesterday to get my fix but super good

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,230
food but this is part of my hobby too

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,080
and as it relates to Google I am a

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,709
Google local guide so I loved in my

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,660
spare time to go try new restaurants and

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,910
do the Google reviews so it's kind of my

00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,410
way of being a food critic without all

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,350
the hassle of being one I just get to do

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,430
it for fun so that's something that I

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,959
enjoy doing alright so let's talk about

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,500
Google and and what I want to talk about

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,810
in this talk today is G suite

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,320
specifically and I'm going to go over

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,280
several examples of how I use G suite in

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,590
my bed

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,219
some ways of how I used you sweet

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,520
personally and hopefully give you some

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:31,150
great ideas first of all how many of you

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,789
are G suite users now fantastic how many

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:38,860
of you would consider yourself a G suite

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:40,689
beginner oh I love that okay so these

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,789
are some of the things that are

00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:45,520
available in G suite that would be your

00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,680
Gmail which for most people when they

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,150
sign up for G suite that's what they're

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,789
wanting is they would they want the

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,340
email system we're also going to talk

00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:58,180
about things like the calendar Google

00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:01,060
Voice and Google Drive is a huge piece

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,639
of that these are not G suite is not

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,830
limited to this I could talk all day

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,389
about G suite and to be honest with you

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,189
each one of these slides that I'm going

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,580
to go through I could do a whole talk

00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:15,939
just on that one side so it's it's it's

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,029
it has so many great tools and so many

00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:20,949
great features I'm just touching on a

00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:24,400
few of them real quick today and giving

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,729
you some ideas of how to use them all

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,099
right

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,279
so Google Chrome is the first thing that

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:33,699
I want to mention how many of you are

00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,050
fairly strictly google chrome users okay

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,729
fantastic

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,149
so one of the things that I want to

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,409
mention here is that you do have

00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:43,990
extensions and you can go to the Chrome

00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:46,599
Web Store to look at those extensions

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,270
and I if you haven't done that I'm sure

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,689
you have to some extent but I try to go

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,639
through every once in a while and just

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,759
take a note of new extensions that may

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,449
be out there specifically for

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:08,139
productivity and that kind of stuff so

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:11,139
let me say I lost my screen oh it's up

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:14,069
here that's why you can see it there at

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,719
the top that I have a few extensions

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,040
loaded up there one of the newest ones I

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,990
think

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,250
and I learned about it we're camper

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,430
Ollie was loom do you already use loom

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,190
it's a fantastic tool for recording

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,590
steps that you might do so I do a lot of

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,850
training whether it be online for my

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:38,280
clients or in person or I might just be

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,860
working with someone and they need a

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,990
step-by-step guide of how to get through

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,740
something I use that to create that

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,780
really quickly

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,400
it is awesome awesome awesome so that

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,080
was a nice little tip but that's just

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,030
one of them that's up there and on to-do

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,730
list is another one that I love to use

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,930
and a lot of these work with the Google

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,510
suite okay to do it especially it will

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,650
embed that your todoist

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,780
items of things that you need to do

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,160
right there on your gmail screen which

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,480
is handy and it will also allow you to

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,190
send an email right to your to-do list

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,960
which is great and it'll link back to

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,420
that email when you need to go back and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,920
do that action item right so I encourage

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,650
you to look through those extensions if

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,110
you haven't already you got this thing

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:26,100
that I want to mention is to save your

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,430
profiles so if we go right here up at

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,340
the top of our Google Chrome experience

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,780
we can click on this button and you'll

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,000
see these are all my different these are

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,910
my my husband and my kids and whatnot

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,200
and various of the things that I have

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:45,360
but I encourage you to go to manage

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,960
people have you guys done this before

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,390
for different chrome experience so it

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,190
will allow you to create new people

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,590
within Chrome okay

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,440
I've run into several folks that have

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:04,080
used this that's my daughter with a

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:06,510
margarita glass I've run into a lot of

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,210
folks that will just log in as another

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,650
instance in chrome they'll know that I

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,830
should say another instance but another

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,830
user in that same chrome window and it

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,650
causes a lot of conflicts so if you're

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:24,060
logged into two gmail accounts in one

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,340
browser window it it freaks out the

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,040
world so be careful with that I would

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,669
highly highly encourage you to create a

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,860
new

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,440
while instead that allows you to have a

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,229
login to everything brand-new just for

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,140
you so for example when my daughter logs

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:43,169
in to Chrome she goes and clicks on her

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,209
little chrome person and everything that

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,390
she uses whether that be her Google

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,839
suite experience whether it be Facebook

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:54,839
whether it be whatever her todoist

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,240
whatever she loved into that herself it

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,250
saves that entire experience for her if

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,130
she went to the Bahamas I'm logged in on

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,870
a hotel computer in the Bahamas all of

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,399
her stuff would pop up there her

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,529
bookmarks her login information

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,079
everything because she logged into that

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,810
one chrome experience so I encourage

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,970
people if you're not using that use it

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,699
because it's fantastic the other thing I

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,870
want to mention is even kognito mode and

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:25,610
the way that you get to incognito mode

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,350
is up here at the top three dots in your

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,920
experience you have a new incognito

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:36,390
window when you go into that what it's

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,860
going to do is it what kind of it'll

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,930
change and everything will be like a

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,990
light grey color but you're just in a

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,820
brand new window of chrome it's not

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,920
logging your cookies it's not logging

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,779
your history so if you want to go to

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,720
some of those websites that maybe you

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,810
don't want your history or cookies or

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,930
whatever to be tracked it's great for

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,420
that it's also great if you it's a quick

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,839
and easy way to get someone else to use

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,740
your chrome experience and not mess with

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,140
the data that's in there and not and and

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,610
when you close the incognito window

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,459
anything that you've been logged into

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,410
will log you out instantly so I like to

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:22,980
use it for that but for a lot of reasons

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:25,610
for that as well okay see where we go go

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,610
ahead yes

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,130
it

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,100
in the same window or as a separate

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,100
window okay yeah and it's kind of funky

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,210
and weird to get rid of but if you'll

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,130
see you afterwards and help you get rid

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,540
of that yeah it is a little weird once

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,520
you get them kind of stuck in there it's

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,840
you have to go find a place to remove

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,310
them but I can help you with that yeah

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,310
okay yes

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,220
[Music]

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,129
right

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,000
[Music]

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
mm-hmm

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,920
unless you create the new user profile

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,560
so this this if you go to the top and

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,960
click on your person and see I've got

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,020
all these different people okay so if I

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,760
need to flip between my different life

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,920
so here's Scout with Julie that's my

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,720
wide business where I sell wine so I

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,580
don't want that mixed up with my other

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,620
stuff so I created a whole separate

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,500
profile so when I want to go to that one

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,260
I click on it it opens up a whole new

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,050
brand new chrome window and everything

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,810
is separate my logins everything is

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:05,140
there and so then I can just switch back

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:09,520
and forth using this little picture up

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,240
here - Artemis Expo Julie and wine Julie

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,240
back and forth

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,970
yes when you when you open it up over

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,970
the last one years

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:38,490
yes yes

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,630
mmm-hmm if you're if that's the way

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,610
you're doing it yes that's the way that

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,310
you should be doing it yeah there's a

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,960
way that you can go to Gmail and log in

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,030
an additional user in the same window

00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,160
that's when you start getting conflicts

00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:04,660
okay okay all right

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,030
so you don't see where I am all right so

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,010
the other thing is drive and this is a

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:15,910
huge huge piece of Google suite in

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:20,050
Google Drive you have documents sheets

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:22,540
you've got slides you have a form

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,520
creator you have drawings which we'll

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,940
talk about in a second so you have all

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,420
of these different really cool tools

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,780
that are either free or cheap depending

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,800
on how you have signed up to use Google

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:45,220
one of the things that I want to mention

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:49,240
here so if I go I keep losing my mouse

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:52,690
all right here we go so if we're looking

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:58,030
at the drive experience we have over

00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:00,400
here on the left side some your

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,500
navigation essentially so one of the

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,290
things there that I think is important

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,070
to mention is the shared with me how

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:13,470
many of you loathe looking at the shared

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,550
with me okay don't be scared

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,650
shared with me is one of the biggest

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,020
complaints that I get is what is this

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,600
place I can't organize it it's all crazy

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:27,250
and it's a mess I tell people don't

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,620
worry about shared with me just let it

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,450
be there in its own little land because

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,410
those are all the documents that someone

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,760
has shared with you so that you can edit

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,920
collaborate work with them view it

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,480
whatever it may be it's just something

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,680
that it's just a place to keep it all in

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,930
one little spot

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,089
you're not gonna organize it you're not

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,680
gonna keep track of it it's always going

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,509
to be a mess

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,970
because the more people that share stuff

00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,009
with you is going to keep updating that

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,829
particular place but here's what you

00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:57,449
need to know about share with me that if

00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:00,329
you're not using it will change your

00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,069
life if you're constantly going to a

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,089
document because someone shared it with

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,670
you and maybe it's something you use

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,379
weekly maybe it's something that your

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,470
assistant created and shared with you or

00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:12,449
your partner or whatever don't leave it

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,949
and shared with me if you go up to the

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:17,069
top of the screen there's a little

00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,300
button that says add to drive okay so if

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,029
it's in shared with me and if it's

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,790
something that you use go ahead and add

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:26,160
it to your drive okay that's gonna put

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,999
it under my drive up here at the top

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,980
left and then it's in your land and if

00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,839
you want to put it in a folder or you

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,540
want to move it around and put it where

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,619
you want to put it then no problem okay

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,429
so you can do that so don't worry about

00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:43,949
share with me

00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,259
don't try to organize it just use it as

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:51,329
it is the other thing I want to mention

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:54,769
is the search I have found that a lot of

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:58,800
folks don't use the power and

00:15:54,769 --> 00:16:01,139
awesomeness of Google search so over

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,569
here if you're in Drive and you drop

00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,839
down this little secret arrow that

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,429
Google loves to put on their products if

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,040
you drop that down you'll see you have

00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:15,420
an option here to change your search

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:20,309
terms look for that document so I have

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:22,139
several experiences where folks have

00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:23,309
come to me and said I lost that document

00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,759
I don't know where it is I know it's

00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:29,160
it's it's gone well it's it's not gone

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,249
you just don't have it organized right

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,540
and so you can come in here and search

00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:38,850
so I don't always put things in folders

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,589
myself I'm not a super organized person

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,269
like that because I know that I can go

00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,549
in here and use the power of the awesome

00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,069
Google search bar and be able to find

00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:50,549
that particular document that I may be

00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:53,190
looking for so use that to help you okay

00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:58,830
the other thing here that I want to talk

00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,710
about in Google Drive is folders and if

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,690
we're looking here and we're creating

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,990
folders one of the ways that I use this

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,839
with my clients I do create client

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,390
folders because I keep everything

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,390
organized for my clients in in their own

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,939
special folder if I'm let's just say I'm

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,860
working with well let me say let me tell

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,660
you this if I get a new client the very

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,790
first thing I do is I go in here into my

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,770
client folder I create one with their

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,540
name I put a document in there with

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,610
information on them whether it be their

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,070
contact information whatever because I

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:37,890
know it's all gonna be right there okay

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:40,260
if I'm gonna do a website for them and I

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,050
know that they are ok with using Google

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,390
folders themselves I'll create a folder

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:48,660
structure for them and share that folder

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,750
with the client ok and I'll do different

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,000
pages or different documents for each

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,800
page of their website and we'll kind of

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,870
work together worth making sure that the

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,250
content is set up so that they can see

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,050
what's in there they can add some stuff

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,780
themselves and we collaborate together

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,550
to make that happen I'll create a folder

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,010
within their website folder structure

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,480
there that they can add all the photos

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,610
that they might have that they want to

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,740
add to their website and things like

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,020
that so it's kind of cool if you have a

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,600
client it's comfortable with that not

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,330
everybody is but if you do it's it's a

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,070
really cool way to work with those folks

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,450
and make sure that everybody is on the

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,070
same page especially if you're working

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,230
from a distance and you don't get to sit

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,790
down with them and work on things you

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,080
guys can see the same things at the same

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,080
time all right

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,950
the other thing is revision history and

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,510
I think I forgot to add that but let's

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:47,430
just talk about revision history for a

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:48,900
minute if we are in a document and I'm

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:53,430
mad at myself right now because I forgot

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,019
to pull this up no I can do it I can do

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:59,889
it hold on

00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:01,389
do you all use revision history huh no

00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:09,149
oh well then I definitely didn't do it

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:09,149
all right so we do this here find my guy

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:30,070
all I have to show you later here we go

00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:31,450
I don't think I'm gonna be able to pull

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,820
it up all right let me tell you about it

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,200
so the document that I wanted to show

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,639
you is this is a personal document but

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,149
kind of a fun way that kind of makes

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:45,849
sense to everybody we have a

00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:47,919
friendsgiving at my house every year so

00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:51,159
every year for friendsgiving I create a

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,469
Google document okay and I send it out

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,109
to everyone and it's on a public you

00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:58,029
know anybody can edit it within Google

00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,259
you don't have to have a login or

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,639
anything just as long as you have the

00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:05,019
link you can get to it

00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:07,299
so everybody goes in and they write oh

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:10,299
I'm Julie and I'm gonna bring mashed

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:12,729
potatoes I'm Sally and I'm gonna bring

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,619
green beans whatever it may be and they

00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:17,589
fill out the little Google document and

00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:21,909
put their information in there well I

00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:27,219
can go back and go under the file menu

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:29,649
and click on View revision history ok

00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:34,179
and when I do that it's going to break

00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:37,059
down that document by Tom by date and by

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:40,149
user and show me exactly who has edited

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,979
that document when they edited it what

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:44,739
they edited so if they took something

00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:47,859
out it'll cross through it and it'll put

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:50,979
a color code on that cross through to

00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:52,629
show oh that was Sally and we have

00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:55,719
determined we're going to make all of

00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:57,519
Sally's revisions pink okay so anything

00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:59,030
that I'm looking in that document over

00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,280
the course of time I can

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,410
else Ali made that change so here's

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,100
another really cool way that I used that

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,550
I worked with my attorney to create my

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,400
website contract and I already had one

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,650
thanks to a awesome wordpress friend

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,320
that I meant I had given me their

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,660
contract that they had been using and so

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,210
I worked with my attorney to kind of

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,920
look at his and make some changes and

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,000
adjustments and we use Google Documents

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,050
to do it

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,860
so my attorney would go in and take

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,170
things out

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,060
add things and then I would go in and

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,860
double-check and I'll be like okay yep

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,690
I'm cool with that and then I would say

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,120
okay I want to add this and I type in a

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,460
little blurb that I might want attorney

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,340
would go in he would look at it and he

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,940
would make those changes and approve it

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,770
or say yeah I don't like that so that

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,960
revision history was really cool because

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,230
we did that over the course of a couple

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,120
weeks and I could go back if I wanted to

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,100
look and see oh why did we take that out

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,900
I can go back and look at comments and

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,470
all that kind of stuff so the revision

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:09,550
history is super cool I'm sorry I didn't

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:14,060
get to demo it the other thing about

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:25,600
Google Drive that can be super cool too

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:36,850
is talk to text so if you are if you are

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:41,120
using here we go if you are using a

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:47,720
Google document I like to use top two

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:53,320
texts for brainstorming so if I open

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:58,010
this document and I go to tools and then

00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,039
voice typing you'll see it pops up here

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:04,330
I can click to speak

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:06,909
then as I am talking it should be typing

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,690
what I say and it's actually pretty

00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:14,679
fantastic at getting everything correct

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:18,039
and I can say things like period new

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,379
paragraph and it will go ahead and

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,479
continue typing I will pull this up

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:24,909
sometimes if I'm driving around and I

00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:29,159
have crazy ideas in my head and I want

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:33,519
to get them out I'll use this tool to

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,590
for that I'll also use this to alterna

00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,690
land bulletin and I'll be like blah blah

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,820
blah blah and I'll hit enter little

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,659
Bolin I'll just oh end up having this

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,369
whole really cool thing of a

00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:50,519
brainstorming document once I get done

00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:50,519
so I really like using that talk to text

00:23:51,239 --> 00:24:03,549
any questions so far yeah go ahead there

00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:05,769
are I don't think it's built in yet but

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:07,989
I have there are extensions that will do

00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:13,629
that for you if you add an extension to

00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:15,119
Chrome and I can't think of off the top

00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:19,299
of my head the one that I've used before

00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,129
anybody know it you know I can look at I

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,869
can look it up later and tell you what

00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:24,489
that is but yes that those options are

00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:29,460
out there with extensions I don't think

00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:29,460
it's built in yet though to drive okay

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:36,580
all right so the weird thing is this

00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:43,289
there we go

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:43,289
that's one way to fix it all right so

00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:48,119
the other thing that I want to mention

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,970
is add-ons if you go into Google

00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:54,759
Documents Google sheets Google slides

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,590
whatever it may be and within the Google

00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,359
Drive Suite there's a button to click

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,720
for add-ons and it's essentially a

00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:05,049
Google Chrome Web Store just for that

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,780
particular tool so for example one that

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,980
I liked

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:14,510
and Google sheets is one called autocrat

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,910
an autocrat will allow you to use the

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,750
magic of Google Forms and Google sheets

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:23,270
together and so when someone fills out a

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:25,760
Google form and the data goes into the

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,860
Google sheet it will email you a

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,950
beautiful Google document that's

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,110
editable of the data that the people

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,470
have filled out in that form so it's

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,290
it's really nice for gathering

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,210
information from a client if you wanted

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,100
to send them a Google Form they fill out

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:47,300
the information that you want from them

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,340
and then you use autocrat to send you a

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,950
beautiful document that then you can put

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,840
it in their client folder okay but it's

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,600
also saved in a spreadsheet so you can

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,280
organize it and filter out and things

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,470
like that of all your clients at one

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:04,250
time so that's kind of a cool woman this

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,380
as a side note all right so I encourage

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,630
you if you have not yet to look at the

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,100
add-ons inside of each one of those

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,840
things because there are a ton of them

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,590
and a lot of them are purchased things

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,670
that perhaps you already purchase and it

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:21,950
integrates somehow into slides or sheets

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:25,040
or dogs it could be another program that

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,250
you already own that will work well

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,250
