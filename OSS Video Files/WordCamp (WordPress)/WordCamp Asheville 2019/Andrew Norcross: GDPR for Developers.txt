	00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,340
this is about the level of interest for

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
this topic that I should expect yeah

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,730
this is one of the most boringest topics

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,820
I've ever given a talk on so I try to

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,810
make it as fun as possible let's see

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,289
this is my little slide thing door does

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:32,940
that stay open or I wasn't paying

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:36,930
attention I'll be honest why are those

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:46,800
two clocks different they're a minute

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:47,969
apart they should be synced hmm all

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,160
right spend more in a minute why is this

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,530
a mountain time the extra 10 minutes you

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,239
gotta have with elevation well it's like

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,350
when I got here Friday I'm like I'm

00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,800
hungry so like let me look at a

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,690
restaurant

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,510
Oh eight minute walk I forgot y'all have

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,610
elevation here it's not a thing that I'm

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,520
accustomed to yeah every one of the

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,049
highest points in our state's a landfill

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,240
not trash more it's above Miami but uh

00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,840
yeah we'll get started so let's see

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,330
there we go

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,189
hi everybody can everybody hear me okay

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,710
I probably don't even know anything I

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,630
turned that out good all right so we're

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,880
gonna talk about gdpr today and let's

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,790
just jump right in there's the button

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,020
there we go so that's me that's kind of

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,409
what I look like that's where I live so

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,880
our work as far as Twitter goes it still

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,990
technically exists but the whole they

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,310
can't seem to get their white supremacy

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,280
under control so I'm not really there

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,450
and what we're gonna do is actually I

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,149
want to jump back real quick

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,720
and point out two things one the title

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,939
and to the lack of letters after my last

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,240
name and I want to say that because in

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,939
no way shape or form is this legal

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,579
advice this is not anything that you

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,399
should go you all know the disclaimers

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,079
however I need to say them if you have

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,060
any questions or concerns about any of

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,649
the stuff talk to your counsel you know

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,189
whatever you may have and figure out how

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,459
it applies that said

00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:22,079
so what the hell is gdpr who here knows

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:25,269
anything about it other than its name

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:29,530
okay who here understands anything about

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,810
it other than its name that's actually

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,540
the most that I've seen in the year that

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,980
I've done this I figured I'd retire this

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,989
talk but everybody keeps needing to hear

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,799
cuz it's still relevant so let's just

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:44,189
jump in it's one of the most vague

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,549
titles I've ever heard that could mean

00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:48,810
anything

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:52,650
so that is technically what it means but

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,750
let's see that's the word we care about

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,819
that is really all we care about nothing

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,099
else about GDP are matters data is the

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,870
only thing that's concerned and in

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,889
particular the way the EU defines that

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,989
we're gonna get into the more that a

00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,790
little bit later is information relating

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:12,400
to an identified or identifiable natural

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,849
person again vague on purpose and

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,530
there's a reason for that and money

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,329
that's why this is what it's actually

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,329
all about and this is why data matters

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,049
sung as a little side note a little

00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:30,009
story here it's uh let's have a seat

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,629
so in I didn't go to a college I had

00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,889
Facebook so I didn't get on there early

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,400
by the time I could actually get on

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:40,000
there I wasn't really invested the first

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,759
privacy bug that Facebook had that's a

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,199
feature but I was like I don't care

00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,040
about this I deleted it like I got rid

00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,810
of faith and this is when you

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,280
theoretically could delete a Facebook

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,870
account like it said two weeks or

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,459
whatever so I did it and think twice

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,620
about it couple years later I had to

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,329
make a fake account for doing web work

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,549
and it was a fake name and all the other

00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,799
stuff and then at some point I reached

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,120
where like you needed a Facebook to log

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,889
in to certain stuff it was just you

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,079
couldn't not have one anymore so I made

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,209
one totally private again like I didn't

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,650
want to be on that it would not let me

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,030
use the email address that I've used on

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,069
the first account that I deleted ten

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:18,599
years prior even though it was deleted I

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:22,060
don't know how much Facebook has on me

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:24,940
because for some of you you were here

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,620
when the internet started a bunch of

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,790
white guys from Silicon Valley

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,460
basically wanted to connect the world

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,160
and all this other lofty

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,380
and and they may have even believed it

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,270
like it I'm not messing up I think at

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,010
the time they actually thought this was

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,250
going to happen the problem is is they

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,740
forgot everything about human nature and

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:49,120
basically they said trust us and we did

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,750
and that was a terrible idea like I

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,120
cannot emphasize how badly of an idea it

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,990
was said just give everybody everything

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,020
they know about us

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,389
and not ask why and not say another word

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,690
about it so let's get into some actual

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,370
numbers this first one and I have the

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,169
links for where all these came from but

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,840
uh that means nothing because I cannot

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,330
imagine the 8% that don't unless they're

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,539
maybe off the grid so like all right

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,880
then that means nothing okay this we're

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:21,039
getting better thirty frankly a number

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,690
seems high to me but all right we say

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,430
thirty you know they understand great

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,840
okay that one 74% of people have limited

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,610
their online activity because they're

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,229
scared of privacy that's 3/4 we build

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,970
websites because we want people to come

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,010
to them whether you're selling stuff

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,389
writing stuff talking about stuff show

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,710
whatever it is you're doing you want

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,080
people there otherwise you wouldn't be

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,550
building the site to begin with so we

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,560
have 74 percent of people that are not

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,150
doing the Internet in some capacity

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,680
because they're afraid of what might

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,599
happen that's kind of a big deal so

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,250
let's start in the beginning what have

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,570
we already done because rarely do you

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,520
reach a point where nothing has been

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,280
done all right quick what do all these

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,729
companies have in common

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,190
big data breaches big ones so we had

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,810
eBay one hundred and forty five million

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:14,110
users target one hundred and ten million

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,260
JPMorgan Chase 83 million uber 57

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,780
million along with 600,000 drivers which

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,120
has way more information anthem which is

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,539
a medical insurance management or

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,419
something like that

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,060
80 million Equifax we all remember have

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:34,000
143 million and that was all our stuff

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,360
and Yahoo with three billion nothing

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,150
happened to any of these companies

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,940
at all so EU comes in and this is a

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,500
problem and the EU and and above and

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,360
beyond everything else will get to again

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,800
a little bit the EU views privacy

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,050
wholesale different than the United

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,340
States says and in no way is this meant

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,310
to be political but the u.s. does not

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,780
believe in privacy period like they can

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,150
say it but everything they do is against

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,310
it the EU has a different fundamental

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,580
idea of what privacy means like they put

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,470
users we don't so again I'm not a lawyer

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,780
there was another law that was in place

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,750
but it was not good enough and the EU

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,950
felt something had to be done this is a

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:17,340
big thing users now have rights to their

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:19,080
data that they never had before it's a

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,220
big one there's three things and again

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,650
this is the biggest thing that people

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,780
have a problem with is the idea of some

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,880
someone having rights for him for

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,370
something intangible like data that he

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,620
never had before but so there's three

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,500
main rights first off is the right to be

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,020
informed that means a that everyone has

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,600
a right to know what information they

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,880
have about you you have to be able to

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,310
see it you have to know when it happens

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,750
if they have a breach or data thing you

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,700
have to be told by them very quickly the

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,100
second one is you have a right to all

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,820
the information that a site has on you

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,070
at will if you want it you have to ask

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,230
for it and I believe there might be like

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,790
a short like a couple of them and via

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,260
time because there's a 30-day limit to

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,230
delete stuff but it may be 30 days you

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,680
have to provide it and it has to be in

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,120
what they call a human readable format

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,440
which again is vague because depending

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,000
on the data is how it would be readable

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,610
but you can't just like give them a

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
sequel down and be like there you go

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,150
yeah you have to give them something

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,530
that a non developer someone who doesn't

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,100
understand that could read him be like

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,390
ok this is what you have and the third

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,710
ones a big one because this is the one

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,420
that we still don't really understand

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,860
how to deal with and it's the right to

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,000
be forgotten and like I said the

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,330
Facebook stuff I thought I had been

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,890
forgotten apparently I was not because I

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,990
could not use my email address which my

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,110
own name to open up and count 10 years

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,110
later

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,530
so that's the big deal the data isn't

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,420
yours it's just not yours anymore the

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,010
easiest idea is it does not belong to

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,620
you at the best-case-scenario you're

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,560
leasing it and most likely you're just

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,500
getting to look at it and that's fine

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,490
because it never really belonged to you

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,030
to begin with

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,530
like big data more or less we agree as a

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,480
joke kind of like cloud is just a server

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,490
in somebody else's building like big

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,920
data is just more data and we never

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,390
bothered to validate any of this data we

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,710
never looked to see if it was accurate

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:24,790
or correct or even usable we just kept

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,320
collecting more and more and more

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,670
speaking for myself when I would build

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
sites I would collect as much as I could

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,730
I didn't know what data they were gonna

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,350
need and when they were gonna need it

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,820
but that when they would need it would

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,160
have to be historical so I'm like yes

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,550
let me start collecting everything that

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,400
is no longer the case so who here thinks

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,520
this doesn't yet apply to them good

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,500
because it does some of you may not but

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,180
almost everybody here it does because

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,440
they remember that remember how we all

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,360
cared about that and then nobody cares

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,620
about that yeah a lot of people thought

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,800
this was the same thing it's not the

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,120
case so does anybody know who this guy

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,620
is nobody should

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,780
his name is James lang I don't know if I

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,270
pronounce his last name right he's an

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,890
engineer for Volkswagen duh everyone

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,110
remember how both swaggin got busted

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,450
cheating the emissions testing stuff

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,570
yeah he was one of the developers he's

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,150
currently serving time in federal prison

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:23,540
he was not the lead developer he was not

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:26,240
the CTO he was not according to the the

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,100
judge he was not the mastermind he

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,089
worked for Volkswagen and he's serving

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,970
time because he wrote code so this

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,830
applies to us like we can't just yeah

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,420
the whole I was just doing my job is not

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:44,060
a viable excuse so maybe I've got

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,010
somebody's attention and the question

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,360
becomes what do you do now it's like now

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,020
like great and now I'm worried what do I

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,250
do

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,260
well first off don't be worried but

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,150
let's start with the easiest questions

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,870
what is personal data because I don't

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,850
think we actually know anymore so this

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,259
is how the EU defines per

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,870
Dayna and notice how they get pretty

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,660
pretty big and the ue you again does it

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,819
differently the e says information

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,790
relating to the natural you know whereas

00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:13,160
the u.s. is personally identifiable

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,100
information they sound like the same

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,660
words difference being in the u.s. your

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,630
email address is your name

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,170
that's identifiable an IP address is not

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,449
your name

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,149
that's not identifiable the EU

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:28,250
understands aggregation they understand

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:30,589
that each of these individual pieces may

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,720
or may not be relevant but when they put

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,550
all together it makes a very big picture

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,470
of who you are as a person and what you

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,149
do online like if you want to get really

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,199
creeped out Google Facebook shadow

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:44,060
profiles so now little all right racial

00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:47,120
or ethnic I don't store any of that

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,529
information political opinions comments

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,420
maybe blog post but okay it's still

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,990
nothing really crazy same with religious

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,240
trade unions us hate unions to health

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,670
data sure orientations that you know

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,139
criminal stuff again most of this stuff

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,149
is things like I don't want to know

00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,079
about anybody like I'd be happy not

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,540
knowing this about most of my friends

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:10,310
but they get even deeper so we're like

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,500
are a genetic data again I'm not even

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,689
sure how I would store that information

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,970
same with biometrics okay baby keep you

00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:20,360
know key fobs or whatever but location

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,670
all right start to do that sooo demise

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,040
data you can't just change someone's

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,740
first name and the last one here this

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,050
online identifier z' there's again a

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,870
very vague term because they want it to

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,740
be because so many things can be

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:39,949
considered an online identifier so they

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,100
wrote this law to cover the technology

00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,300
that hasn't been invented yet for

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,209
example I know it's a little side note

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,490
voice search Alexa all that did not

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,040
exist when they write when they started

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,319
writing GD P are the law accounts for it

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,329
already they didn't make it so rigid

00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:59,300
that it basically created loopholes they

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:01,209
tried to cover everything and they're

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,339
still writing it did pretty good job so

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:08,389
this is what some identifiers would be

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,110
how many of these are in the WordPress

00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,210
user table right now

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:19,160
at least two depending on how you store

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:22,580
Mehta could be more exactly so like

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,440
we're already doing this so if you have

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,300
comments you sell stuff and in addition

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,120
to this you got emails you have avatars

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,940
you've got a whole slew of stuff that

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,380
again everything pieced together can

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,820
figure out the whole thing oh I was

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,800
talking to a friend of mine now I saw a

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,390
Facebook ad they're not listening to you

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,890
we're just that predictable and we give

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,630
them that much information that they can

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,920
actually make an accurate picture who we

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,550
are and what we like

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,800
it's creepy at times but so yeah so this

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,740
applies to everybody who does any sort

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,590
of business with the EU and yes this

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,630
literally applies to everybody in the EU

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,490
all businesses all sectors all

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,760
organisations regardless of size

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,970
scenario profit or not does not matter

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,350
if there's if you have data this applies

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:12,410
to you now I've gotten this question a

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,930
couple times where they're like oh well

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,230
I just won't sell the EU can anybody

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,350
here name every country in the EU

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,150
neither can i second of all I sort of

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,700
familiar with proxies VPNs

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,180
good luck identifying who is actually in

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,930
the EU

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,180
you can't period and you can't also what

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,270
you cannot do is have a button like

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,680
remember the whole like yes I'm 18 you

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,070
can't do that you cannot ask somebody to

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,330
opt out of a law

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,740
legally you cannot say no this law I

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,830
don't care about your gum you can't do

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,210
it so yeah good luck trying to get

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,270
around it like it's easier to just deal

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,040
with it and get around it so basically

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,470
everything involving gdpr falls under

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,900
two baskets you have your data

00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,440
controllers and those are the people

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,960
that they decide what to collect where

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,410
and how it is used and whom it is shared

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,480
with the other part is processor and

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,010
that's whatever they do with it and if

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,710
you're questioning which one am I

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,960
probably both google analytics is a

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,800
processor you're collecting data

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,000
you're also passing it on so Google is

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,880
responsible for the data they hold

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,889
that's not your problem but you have to

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,220
tell people you have a Google

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,989
that kind of stuff so the whole idea is

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,889
privacy by design which we've never

00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,869
really done

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,709
we have always kind of bolted that stuff

00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:34,029
on the end and we've heard enough

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,109
security talks in the last two years

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,600
really like you have to think about

00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:39,579
security first not last privacy is the

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,970
exact same way you cannot just bolt it

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,109
on at the end you will miss something

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,879
and this thing actually here is not just

00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,279
like a cool phrase like it's a literal

00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,019
design method seven-point development

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,069
methodology that's been written down and

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,689
established and you can follow and then

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:58,809
this is the thing you need to know

00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:01,419
everything about the site that you are

00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:04,239
managing you cannot pretend that you

00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,350
just don't know it's not a viable thing

00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,579
anymore you need to know what you're

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,679
collecting you know where you're putting

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:12,970
it you know who can see it because

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:15,129
that's a big thing is everything like

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,569
it's you can't just pretend that stuff

00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:20,919
isn't you know you don't know about it

00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:23,379
anymore so this is a now legal

00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,779
requirement in the EU this is a real

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:27,129
document that you have to create privacy

00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,069
impact statement again more cool vague

00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,689
Wars but basically anything they call

00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:33,999
data intensive which if you have a

00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,350
database your data intensive it's not a

00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,910
line from there like if there's data

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,589
it's probably intensive and frankly I

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,610
wouldn't want to choose that one wrong

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,410
if I'm in court so basically you have to

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,489
have everything documented what data

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,980
might be questionable what data could be

00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:52,629
a problem who can access it when can

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,999
they access it how can they access it

00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:57,699
all of this has to be literally written

00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:59,499
down available to everybody who is

00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,989
involved with a project including

00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:04,029
regulators who can ask at any moment and

00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,880
you have to provide it to them so again

00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:09,370
this isn't a do this before launch this

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,620
is a write this before you start and

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,870
again it's not that difficult you just

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,639
figure out okay what am i collecting and

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,779
that's where you have the conversations

00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:19,529
with people because all right who here

00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:23,740
is in marketing all right I'm gonna

00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:25,839
unintentionally make fun of you yeah

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,289
like I listen to a lot of Mikey listen

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,460
to Bill Hicks you know the jokes so the

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,879
big thing is this is still evolving this

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,960
is not a static or done thing like I

00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,900
said the voice search like they had

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
integrated that without actual

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,990
having to save voice search but I'm sure

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,670
that we're gonna invent something that

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,130
they didn't think about yet that's kind

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,180
of how progress works so they're still

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,830
writing this stuff down they're still

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,830
working through some of it

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,240
there's the privacy directive in 2002

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,309
they called it the cookie law which was

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,000
a terrible name but it was they're

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,220
building on top of that England has said

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,960
they already have the same GDP our law

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,730
in place if they actually go through

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,490
with brexit so that will still apply

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,990
even if Britain is no longer in the EU

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,530
so like again we're not getting away

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,360
with it so this is a good part like all

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,650
right what's enforced because again I've

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,270
never heard of anybody getting a VAT

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:19,980
penalty ever and yes absolutely yes it

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,780
is the law has been in place for about a

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,090
year now it was May was the one-year

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,090
anniversary so in January

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:30,800
France fine and the countries get to

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,120
find not the EU so I was like France

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,679
find Google fifty-seven million dollars

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,650
in January which again for Google's not

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,270
that much money and I think it's euro so

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,660
I guess that's my room my room what real

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,490
money is but so you think oh they're

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,980
okay Google got a penalty like great

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,230
cool but like I'm not Google they're not

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,120
gonna notice me yeah I know they're

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,290
actually gonna notice you to the first

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,260
fine they ever gave out was for an

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,429
obscure German social network that like

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,230
the fine was like thirty thousand euro

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,240
which seems I don't know if that was a

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,679
lot or not for that company but it was a

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,780
company I've never heard of like some

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,260
weird social network that was only in

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,990
Germany they did everything right they

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,610
did not have anything in plain text they

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,350
had everything written down they had a

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,480
breach they notified their users

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,230
immediately they cut everything off they

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,550
did everything right and they had a fine

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,620
because they still had the breach they

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,860
still didn't do everything they were

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,840
supposed to do that's the thing is like

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,210
yeah you can't stop everything but the

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,630
less that you collect so that's the

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,300
first part

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,010
ignorance is in no way an excuse they

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,330
don't care last time I checked courts do

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,640
not care if you knew what the law was in

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,790
any way shape or form regardless of the

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,020
law so yeah you can't pretend I didn't

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,309
know about this I didn't know about that

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,790
they're like well who's in charge you

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:49,059
are oh well then you should know and

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:53,100
yeah it's more work

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:55,120
and the second part is this it's privacy

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,799
again like I said earlier the US does

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,999
not actually believe in privacy like the

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,299
idea that we don't actually like the

00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:03,009
implementation you have to care about

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,049
privacy now you have to care about

00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:07,389
privacy of people you've never met you

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,679
likely will never meet and you very well

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,090
may not even care about or like

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,769
depending on the kind of site you're

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,889
running they could be a troll and you

00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:18,190
still have to care about their privacy

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,600
which is a weird feeling but it's

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,769
actually the right one because again

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,799
they go back to the idea of having

00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,119
rights and it's very very easy so

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,519
there's something else I'm gonna get to

00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:31,539
before that so hold on let me let me

00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:35,470
there's buttons wait anyway I will

00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:37,480
get that in a second but so in terms a

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,740
couple of easy quick things like number

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,090
one you cannot Auto check any boxes ever

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,220
anymore

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,899
period you cannot automatically say yes

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,409
I want to hear more about your products

00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:52,659
they have to opt-in you cannot opt-in

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:55,450
people to new things because they've

00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:57,490
opted in to old things if you have a new

00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,669
thing they need to opt-in to the new

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,860
thing they get to opt out at any point

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:04,360
for any reason and it cannot have

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,830
anything to do you can't be like oh you

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,730
don't want on my newsletter you can't be

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,409
on my side anymore

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,639
that's a weird issue they haven't

00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,080
decided whether or not that's actually

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:13,090
allowed like you can pull stuff away if

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,399
there or not but yeah it's like if you

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,200
don't want me they go away

00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:21,039
so yeah the biggest thing is stop

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,549
collecting data that sounds weird to us

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,580
I know it sounded incredibly weird to me

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,889
but think of how much data you've

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,559
collected on users and never looked at

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:34,119
again I'd say at least from my own

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,249
experience for months stuff that I have

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,830
built about at least 80% I have never

00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:40,450
looked at a first time I wrote the code

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,139
to collect it I tested that worked and I

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,330
never looked at it again I had a

00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:48,580
analytics thing on my own site years ago

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,840
is a called Pickwick I knew the name of

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,539
it recently it was like an open source

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,999
thing run it yourself whatever I forgot

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm touched my site in like five years

00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:58,299
but I forgot it was there I only knew

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,340
about it cuz I got an email when they

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,370
didn't change their name and I was like

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,840
I deleted the script

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,790
and I deleted the database of

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,320
information so now I'm not liable

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,200
anymore because the information no

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,160
longer exists that's the oh don't keep

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,080
what you don't need marketing will tell

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,560
you that they need all of it usually

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,930
they're not right in this case they are

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,790
not right

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,170
because that information is again we

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,760
never said if it was clean we never said

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,440
it was valid we never said it was useful

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,540
like the reason marketing makes up

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,370
metrics is because there's no way to do

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,570
it otherwise like I used to make fun of

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,660
them for doing it but then I realized

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:39,000
there's no other metric to give so

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,740
they'll just make a new metric but have

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,030
a conversation with everybody involved

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,550
because yeah marketing is gonna care

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:47,610
that's how they do their job so you'd be

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:50,850
like what do you need not what do you

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,740
want what would be nice to have but what

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,310
information do you need to do your job

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,050
marketing start there then find out what

00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,190
they might want and see if it's

00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,020
something that a you even want to

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,370
collect and be you feel comfortable

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,470
holding on to because that's the big

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,450
thing is that once you hold it

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,630
you have you're holding it like it's now

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,790
on you if you don't need it don't keep

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,110
it I wrote a plug-in actually a give a

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,040
sock in Atlanta and afterwards I wrote a

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,630
plug-in because I was having a

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,660
conversation with Dwayne at Pantheon

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,310
that will automatically scrub the IP

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,480
address from comment table every time

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,030
someone leaves comment and replace it

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,380
with one to seven point 0.01 because I'm

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,240
like I don't care about anybody's IP

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,350
address anymore that used to be valid

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,580
when people would like leave a bunch of

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,880
comments under different names but you

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,230
find the same IP now trolls know how the

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,510
PN's works so it's like that's not even

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,460
valid anymore so I don't want the data

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,200
anymore if you don't need it get rid of

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,440
it you don't have to hold on to this

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,610
stuff simply because it exists if the

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,370
thing I how many times you hear about

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,810
someone left a AWS server unencrypted

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,820
and they pulled all this data because it

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,940
was just sitting there and someone found

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,530
it yeah like that's the kind of stuff

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,730
that I'll do like I'm not gonna make

00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,530
something you know it's like I'll put

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,480
something on an s3 or server somewhere

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,160
and just forget about it I've forgotten

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,890
my own birthday more than once as an

00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,050
adult I'll forget about that and that's

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,240
the stuff there's like oh now I'm in

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,550
trouble and now it's like old yeah did I

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,380
secure it I don't know it was there I

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,650
get five dollar bills from a bunch of

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,140
hosts I just okay

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,550
I don't even know it's like sit down

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,650
ferret what you have because it's very

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,910
easy especially if you're freelancing or

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,980
working in an agency where it's like

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,200
what's the next project what do I need

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,630
to do next this is done cool I don't

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,550
think about it anymore what's next if

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,980
you do the privacy work in the beginning

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,750
it's part of the process so when you're

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,760
done you're still done you don't have to

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,870
go back and figure out how to now back

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,120
into proper user privacy it's very easy

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,700
to build privacy it's very hard to

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,950
implement after the fact just like

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,840
everything else we build you really wish

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,179
you knew about it sooner like that one

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,970
client look oh by the way we would like

00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,050
this it's like well that sounds great

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,690
unfortunately that's totally counter to

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,400
everything else we've built for you have

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,440
a conversation in the beginning now is

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,090
anybody else ever had to deal with this

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,809
with their clients customers whatever

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,460
and what is the biggest pushback and

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,750
this is for me as much as for you what

00:25:09,460 --> 00:26:06,130
is the biggest pushback you've had from

00:25:10,750 --> 00:26:07,390
people correct so here's the thing that

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,840
I think most people are confused about

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,030
you are still allowed to collect every

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,640
bit of information that you have always

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,340
been collecting you just can't do it

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,380
without telling them that's the

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,300
difference it's not that the data is

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,110
illegal it's not that you cannot legally

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,610
collect it

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,380
you just can't collect it not say

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,350
anything about it and you can't collect

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,030
it and sell it to other people without

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,919
but he's concerned you can't sell it and

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,630
you know you can't do any you just can't

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,350
do it without in a vacuum you can't do

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,360
in the shadows

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,130
that's the difference you just have to

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,520
tell people what you're doing that's it

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,809
they do that you're fine like you're

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,120
more or less gonna be okay again talk to

00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,830
your lawyers don't you know don't know I

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,669
was married to a lawyer once and that's

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,690
about it so so we're gonna you know some

00:26:50,669 --> 00:27:10,110
we're gonna actually gonna jump into

00:26:51,690 --> 00:27:13,860
questions either it's a terrible

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,840
algorithm or they're just wrong then

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,370
they're wrong then that may assume that

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,900
everybody else is intelligent enough to

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,419
know that these three pieces of data

00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,700
equals this which that answers is no

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,809
like you know it because it's your

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,659
client and they know it because they

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,190
wrote it nobody else does and in that

00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,510
case where it's like then they need to

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,059
figure that out because it's it doesn't

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,340
matter if it doesn't if it's not ideal

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,870
for what you're doing like that kind of

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,409
goes back the whole ignorance doesn't

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,950
count anymore

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:43,020
it doesn't matter if it's not good for

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,780
you or not what you want like again they

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,130
don't care about any of that so in the

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,870
event where someone and his question was

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,610
like and this is more question but also

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,690
push back because these are the these

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,480
are the things that people actually deal

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,380
with is they were afraid that by

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,940
disclosing what they're collecting

00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,309
they're telling people what they're

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,320
going to do with it which is the law

00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,520
they have to tell you what they're doing

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,990
with it now they don't have to say we're

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,700
gonna use the weight of this and a

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,530
weight of that to figure out that you

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,909
want to read this that's not the detail

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,230
they need but you have to say we're

00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:12,809
keeping this we're keeping this we're

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,480
keeping this and we're going to end and

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:17,280
then say we're going to use that to show

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,559
you things to read they don't have to

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,390
say we're going to show you during this

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,130
math to show you what to read like that

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,320
they don't tell that but you have to say

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,289
this information is going to be used to

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,000
do this and as a user I'm cool with that

00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,220
it's like tell me what you're gonna do

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,270
it's like google i weirdly trust because

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,190
i know they just want to show me the

00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,130
best the ad that i'm most likely to

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,870
click on amazon wants me to buy more

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,220
stuff i'd do that all the time so they

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,760
show me things they think i might want

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,380
to buy bay

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,340
someone I bought Facebook just wants to

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,190
connect the world now and trust that

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,210
robot dude anyway so it's like Facebook

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,470
doesn't really tell you what they want

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,450
to do with it and that's why I don't

00:28:49,470 --> 00:29:06,570
trust him

00:28:50,450 --> 00:29:08,730
and we're gonna go to her next there is

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,220
a stipulation in law that says you do

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,810
not have to modify backups so if by

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
chance someone asked to delete their

00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,780
stuff and then you have to restore from

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,390
a backup and the data is there again

00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,680
you're not automatically in trouble you

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,090
should go back and delete it again so

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,310
keep track of cuz you have to keep track

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,540
of the requests that you get and you

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,490
just go back and delete whatever but

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,410
yeah if if the data is still in a backup

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:32,450
that is not you're not liable for that

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,450
and if she was next

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,719
[Music]

00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,230
I mean the people that are making laws

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,480
about the Internet's some of them still

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,789
think that what goes through tubes so I

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,440
don't think that any law of the US

00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:11,470
rights will be in any way shape or form

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,789
good for this because they're coming

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,309
from the idea that the corporation's

00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,840
need data users shouldn't care so like

00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,730
it's it's a it'll take a fundamental

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,970
shift before any legislation in the u.s.

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:26,019
is in my own opinion will happen in the

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,730
you totally different so I doubt they're

00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:30,490
gonna legislate design in that capacity

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,899
other than because again certain stuff

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,399
they left vague on purpose because they

00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:34,990
know the implementation is going to be

00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,659
dependent on the technology like you

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,330
can't have a link on a voice search

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,350
there's no click so you know by doing so

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,380
it's like yeah you have your privacy

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,730
policy like there is stuff in core to

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,580
yeah you basically a link and people can

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,990
request so some of that stuff exists and

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,100
they're still building out again because

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,659
it's like depending on what you collect

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,090
and how you collect it is how you have

00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:57,190
to manage it so there isn't a one tool

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,279
for everybody because most likely to

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,480
people are not doing the same thing so

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,220
they will probably say something along

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,950
lyza that has to be you know either in

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,630
the sitemap or a link some like on an

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,190
account page like I don't think I have

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,210
to put it like right dead center but

00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,679
yeah your pride as well as it's

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,960
accessible like I don't think is long as

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,120
you don't bury and specifically hide it

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,850
and that's the other thing we don't know

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,470
yet if people will actually care we have

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,519
no idea it's only been about a year most

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:26,049
people in the US don't understand it

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,669
anyway so I don't know how many people

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,399
are gonna start caring but my guess

00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,840
would be as these things keep happening

00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,510
breaches and and more stuff like that

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,950
people aren't going to want to know like

00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,600
once they start is like once they

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,500
realize they can get it from one person

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,840
they're gonna want it from everybody

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,220
because like oh this is Dana about me I

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,429
want to know and they go get everything

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,019
so yeah you just have to be accessible

00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:50,220
both in the literal sense and the you

00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:50,220
know the accessibility sense

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,290
so they they have not been specific

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,420
about what you need to have on your site

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,280
in terms of like prompts or things like

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,930
that because again not knowing anything

00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,640
about it could be a single page app it

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,890
could be you know a full of old

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,290
WordPress CMS build it could be a thing

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,870
you know who knows what so ya privacy

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,220
policy absolute bare minimum like if you

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,980
don't have a privacy policy just turn

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,300
off your website until you do there's a

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,640
link now in court hit a button no be

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,110
there that's fine and then they get

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,430
explain what's going on and be like you

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,410
know you're you know because again you

00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:31,080
very well may not be collecting you may

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,070
not be holding much information like I

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,540
have clients had never turned on

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,980
comments to begin with because they

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,070
didn't want comments which I totally

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,960
agree with so they were not actually

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,310
collecting anybody's data it was going

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,100
analytics it was doing that stuff so

00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,970
they were they in that case they were a

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,930
processor because they were sorry they

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,490
were a controller because they were

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,960
taking the data and passing it on they

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,250
were not doing anything with it they

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,740
were not holding it they were not

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,940
storing it they pass it on so all you

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,100
had to say is basically like we use

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,990
Google Analytics that's more or less the

00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,990
equivalent what you have to say okay

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,520
yeah again like they've not said you

00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,170
have to have this link or this page

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,910
because most people writing those laws

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,280
don't understand that stuff anyway but

00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:13,110
unlike the u.s. the EU they knew that

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,060
they didn't understand it so they wrote

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,920
it to where it would cover things and

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,120
they actually brought in experts like

00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,320
they brought in a whole bunch of people

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,050
to make sure that this thing was

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:26,760
actually written for technology and not

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:27,630
for 30 years ago so it's a yeah they're

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,470
still again they're still working

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,430
through a lot of it because they're

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,380
figuring you know we're still figuring

00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,970
out what we have like I don't think we

00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,640
still know the landscape in terms of

00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,990
like how much data people have and what

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,930
they have because like when I went over

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:42,480
those breaches target may have

00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,370
information on me but it probably is my

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,850
name and email

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:49,620
Equifax has everything I've ever done

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:53,900
that's a bigger breach even if it was

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,740
less people it's a much bigger breach so

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,560
exactly so it's like depending on the

00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,780
data you're holding is what the problem

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,160
theoretically could be because it's like

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,240
I get you know if someone steals email

00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,240
addresses I don't think anybody's gonna

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,380
really care but yeah credit card like

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,750
you should never store credit card

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,090
inform them

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,649
but you know as soon as it gets I'd

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,840
stuff like that like I don't want

00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,639
anybody's social security number I want

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,500
the absolute minimum of anybody else

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,590
that is on my site as I possibly can

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,389
have period because that's the least

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:25,179
amount of liability it's that easy and

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,679
then one person I did talk to they got

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,570
on because they're basically you so they

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,510
did they got ready for this like two

00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,629
years ago he was actually saying they're

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,780
marketing data is better because it's so

00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:39,310
succinct and clean because they're like

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,560
we know where it's coming from we can

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:44,050
validate that it's real it's not just a

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,970
dummy sign up to get something like they

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,500
can actually it's real data they can

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,659
actually have been able to do actionable

00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,790
things with because they can look at it

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,379
and they know the source

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,389
they know that it's clean they know that

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,790
it's valid information that they

00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,540
collected the proper way it wasn't just

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,540
a dub of stuff

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,630
yeah so as I said like the US will

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,190
eventually adopt something similar and

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,050
California will be the one to lead the

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,270
way because they're the only ones that

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,530
really understand technology like they

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,060
have actual programmers who have become

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,930
senators in California so like they

00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,010
actually sort of understand it given

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,260
everything else going on in California I

00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,910
don't know when they'll get around to it

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,160
it's been in the news it very well could

00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,450
and again it's like one of those where

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,369
how do you apply a state law across the

00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,680
country where servers are located like

00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:41,109
their redundancy in seven states which

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,730
law do you apply so they'll do it on

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:44,560
much I think it'll probably only apply

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,569
to companies that are like in Silicon

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Valley or in San Francisco and and that

00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:50,349
sort of stuff because that's dealing

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,470
ones they can really enforce but we'll

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,670
see they may write it so it will get

00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,720
adopted federate you know at the

00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,760
national level which again would be

00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,040
great

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,260
I'd like this law I'll say that now I

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,480
actually like this law because I don't

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,119
like the idea that everybody knows way

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,710
more about me than I do like they have

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,180
so much information on me they probably

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:15,130
know what I'm gonna do before I'm gonna

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:17,140
do it well yeah so does my mom actually

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,790
know she got that wrong once - yeah

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,020
imagine waking up to your text message

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,290
from your mother seven days before your

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,240
birthday

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:25,180
no start no nine because it wasn't the

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,099
right calendar day but anyway yeah so

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,810
it's like just yeah don't store it and

00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,160
if you need it safe you know it's like

00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,589
it's very very Beit is like the things

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,660
we tell toddlers if you're gonna take

00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:37,119
something ask if you're gonna do

00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,349
something tell me if you're leaving tell

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,760
me when you're coming back yeah it's

00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:41,319
like all the things you say to kids and

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,829
toddlers is basically how you approach

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,230
gdpr

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,819
like don't do anything just because you

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,710
want to and you don't say anything about

00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:50,160
it like that's how you get in trouble

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,160
and

00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:05,420
in terms of accessibility I guess it

00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,430
would really come into which you know

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:12,200
how you're displaying it yeah like don't

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:13,640
don't hide it because you like it yeah

00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,310
like the thing we're like we use cookies

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,570
and hit okay like that's that's more or

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,410
less enough for a lot of things like

00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,300
again if you're not really doing

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:36,020
anything with anybody's data that's

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:38,150
probably enough again not a lawyer so

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,890
what I would say is for my conversations

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,810
with folks on the accessibility team and

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,240
once people are actually blind screen

00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:47,630
readers are incredibly varied from one

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,150
to the other they don't work the same so

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,500
I don't know how a notice would show

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,480
because I don't even know what screener

00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,340
it would be I would probably say don't

00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,650
get too fancy with your JavaScript and

00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,970
animations and just make it a button

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,260
like make it something dead simple

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,140
because people are just gonna click it

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,580
to make it go away and so wherever it

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,440
needs to be in terms of you know because

00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,920
accessibility again that's a whole you

00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,270
know team of people much less a topic so

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,860
it would be like yeah if anything test

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,750
it like most anything else test it

00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:24,530
because all that stuff is usually pretty

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:25,820
available question yes I thought about

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,970
if you want jump in that later that's

00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,970
cool

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,030
yeah it's just like one of they follow a

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,770
pet you know usually they'll outline and

00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,300
the screen readers will say don't do

00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,920
this or don't do that and there's one or

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,450
two that are very popular than a couple

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,190
obscure ones it's like yeah I don't

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,340
account for the Opera browser anymore

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,390
sorry I don't have time so it's like

00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,590
yeah there may be a screaming or

00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,270
somewhere that may not read it right but

00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,820
it's some obscure one that somebody

00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,830
built or whatever but the main ones tell

00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,380
you what to do like if you follow good

00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,600
markup you shouldn't have much of a

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,960
problem and I say that as someone who

00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,960
can see

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,390
yes so one of the first examples of this

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:22,910
I actually saw was I think hmm or one of

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,530
the retailers that's based predominantly

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,390
in Europe that also has some stores in

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,559
the US that's where you'll start to see

00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,140
this stuff first people that are based

00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:33,170
in the EU but do business in the US they

00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,760
implement it because I have to so they

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,859
had one works like I want to hear things

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,049
about category 1 I'm gonna hear things

00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,819
about category 2 so they would

00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:42,289
individually opt in so you can break

00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:45,380
that down as detailed as you want

00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:46,579
there's like like obviously more options

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,920
you get people less likely will do

00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:52,400
something balance that out but yeah you

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,990
can say this but not this and as long as

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,329
you've built whatever you're doing that

00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,280
you can work with this and not have this

00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:59,839
then you're fine yeah certain cookie

00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,670
stuff that doesn't work if other pieces

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,910
aren't there so just make sure you don't

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:29,390
let people opt into half because then it

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:33,410
will just work first person will get

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:35,270
fined seriously I mean how many things

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,010
do we not do anything about until

00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:39,349
there's a very large penalty in front of

00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,520
us that will probably be what it takes

00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:42,020
for certain people to implement it here

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,460
it does make em listen to they can

00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,299
listen to talks from everybody they can

00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,619
listen you know they can do everything

00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:52,700
yeah they have lawyers something to it

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:54,500
they're like find me they recently cos

00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,089
only been in place for a year they only

00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,609
started finding people like around

00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:01,400
beginning in 2019 there's a handful that

00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:02,750
were announced like two weeks ago and I

00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,240
didn't get a chance to dig up the detail

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,010
so I didn't put them in here but I don't

00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,930
they they find companies that probably

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,119
do business I don't think they find a US

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,619
company other than Google yet they're

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,650
gonna find Facebook they're probably

00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:17,059
gonna find Twitter and Amazon as well if

00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,589
I were betting I would say at least one

00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:22,359
of those and we got time for them like

00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:22,359
one more weren't you more

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:36,580
big ecosystem privacy policies as a

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:38,410
service experience or recommendations no

00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,480
only because the the people you know

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,640
since this I work for liquid web so like

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,870
I've not done detailed client stuff

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,090
since has been enacted

00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:48,310
however the clients that care like go

00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,710
talk to your lawyer like get a lawyer

00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:53,410
because if something goes wrong there

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,490
could be one defending you and then but

00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,020
yet go through with it because again

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,930
there's been so much now written on this

00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,790
that is probably a lot clearer for

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,770
attorneys because and also they now

00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,420
there have been fines they know where to

00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,830
go out well this is a line we don't want

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,750
to go at this line I work backwards

00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:12,310
that's what they that's what I do that's

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:17,230
what probably they do so there is in the

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:18,610
news like it'll keep seeing and it'll

00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,150
probably yeah it's hard to get most

00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,110
people don't care so it's like you hear

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,280
about it and then you don't hear about

00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,140
it because again most people don't even

00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,720
understand what happened much less why

00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,130
they should be caring about it so you'll

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,010
see it and then every now at you know is

00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,360
slowly but surely people just do it as

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,410
usually it's like incremental changes

00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,390
they don't notice and then all of a

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,600
sudden they have privacy again fingers

00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,600
crossed

00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,160
yeah and that's the thing it's like when

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:10,250
I say 57 million or 57 million euro to

00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,230
Google is a rounding error that's not

00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,450
even in a good line item it's a rounding

00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,800
error but that 30 grand for that weird

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,090
social network that could have been half

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:26,720
their cash flow mmm

00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:27,860
we don't know it's like this was a

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,450
question that came up previous is like

00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,670
how do I know if a sites deleted my data

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,430
and the answer is you don't there's no

00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,320
way to verify it there's no one has

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,750
figured out a way to like you I can't

00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,840
look in your database that would be a

00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:43,250
security problem so it's like yeah with

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,600
Facebook like yet they didn't delete it

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:50,450
clearly and so yeah they've not gone

00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,700
anything after font follow-up to finds

00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,410
in part because like Google is like well

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,170
what'd they find them on being Google

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,930
what do you do your Google you can't

00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,920
just not be Google anymore

00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,600
so a lot of companies have been

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,800
implanting stuff behind the scenes cuz

00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,500
again a lot of this is back-end work

00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,460
that nobody cares about you may have

00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,320
gotten a bunch of emails in the last

00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,670
year asking you to Reese I nut for

00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
mailing lists that you're already on a

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,800
lot of people did that they're like look

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,000
I was gonna say like I was glad they did

00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,520
it because there were some that I kept

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,470
like the Lego VIP when I get that and

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,290
I'd probably buy some 80% of the time in

00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,670
Italy but I got rid of a whole slew of

00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,560
others that I'd forgot that even had

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,270
again cuz it's like I was reminded of

00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,590
what I signed up for 15 years ago when I

00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,140
got an email saying do you still want

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,320
this that was like I've gone ten years

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,400
for that I probably good so yeah it says

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,590
there's gonna be a lot of backfill

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,030
there's still I mean once they find

00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:46,550
somebody where it impacts not just the

00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,410
company and I don't know what that would

00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,490
be like I don't know how that in peg

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,290
words like they have to shut something

00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,790
down at the turnoff a feature that

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,460
people care about like that may

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,560
influence things but at this point I'm

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,130
straight up speculating how how they'll

00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,140
do it because they

00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,460
they don't know yet but the different

00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,589
again the difference is the EU knows

00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,109
that they don't know that yet so they're

00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:07,220
not trying to go around it they're like

00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:08,480
yeah we'll figure that out but like

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,069
right now we're making sure we can cover

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,329
everything that can go wrong before we

00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:13,730
figure out how to deal with someone

00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:15,559
after we find them so and I imagine that

00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,990
the pie just keep finding them because

00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,069
that's really the only thing they can do

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,630
maybe if it's really bad they can shut

00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:21,769
down their server but then you just move

00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,019
it to a country that wasn't there and

00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,250
it's all problems so like yeah I don't

00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:26,420
know like some of the enforcement

00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,160
stuff's gonna be really weird it's gonna

00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,099
be scattered because the country itself

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,809
does it not the EU as a whole so like

00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:34,279
France decided to do this Germany can

00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:35,599
turn around do the same thing every

00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,880
single country in the EU could find

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,109
Google a percentage of money all right

00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,549
and the number

00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:41,750
I think the limit is ten percent of

00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,180
revenue is what you're allowed to find a

00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,680
company oh yeah they could find way more

00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,029
than they do

00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,190
giant numbers like they made the number

00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,420
big enough to matter and but I think

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,339
they're just not starting at that number

00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,269
but I would not be surprised that they

00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:56,029
went to one of those companies and

00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:58,640
implemented like that level of fine

00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:59,779
just to get the point across because

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,250
after a while when you have that many

00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:02,690
zeros in your account you don't notice

00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:06,710
until there's that many zeros and a fine

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:08,119
so like they're gonna do it like they're

00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,769
waiting like they're chomping at the bit

00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,589
like the EU doesn't like Google and

00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:15,589
Facebook anyway so they're going they're

00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:17,690
encouraged to do this so especially with

00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:19,670
all the election stuff that's happened

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,160
weird misinformation and then again

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,630
nothing political at this point that

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,859
kind of stuff falls into it cuz like now

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,680
who they didn't know who was putting

00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:29,900
these ads up like you go on Facebook and

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,819
say I want to look at men in their 40s

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,170
who are live in areas that are

00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:34,579
predominantly white and seem to like

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,619
white supremacy that was a button you

00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:38,089
could click at one point like what

00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,769
groups they were involved in you could

00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:41,809
target that kind of stuff like that's

00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:43,460
creepy because I don't know the data

00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:45,259
they have on me I don't know how

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,720
Facebook can target me and Google can

00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:49,339
target me I just know that they do but

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,630
now at least in the EU you can legally

00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:55,400
say what are you using to target me and

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,720
it's like if I know I feel better about

00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,920
it like that's the weird thing it's like

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,980
I don't even have a problem with them

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,779
tracking me to a degree it's I just

00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,250
don't know what's being tracked it's

00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:06,559
like I'm in the dark about it and that's

00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,519
what I don't like and most people like

00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,690
they don't they don't know what they

00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,009
don't know so they don't think about it

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,620
they're like oh cool face book a look at

00:47:10,009 --> 00:47:13,820
pictures of dogs and kids

00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,200
but regular people start caring when

00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,610
like yeah the bank account gets hit so

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,380
it's gonna be money in some way shape or

00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,480
form of what make people change so I

00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,340
think that's good so we're gonna go

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,530
ahead and just get out of here and I

00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:29,090
believe lunch is happening so he was the

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,980
smarter of the two that's the worst

00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:33,700
thing he was might he was the governor

00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,700
