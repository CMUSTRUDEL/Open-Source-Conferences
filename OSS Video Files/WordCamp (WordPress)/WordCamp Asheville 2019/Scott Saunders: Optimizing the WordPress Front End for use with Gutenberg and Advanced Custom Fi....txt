thank you

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,870
how's everyone doing that's nice um I

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,359
want to say that we're at a Star Trek

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
theme word press conference in my first

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,380
name is Scott and not one person has

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,320
come up to me and said beam me up Scotty

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,609
now what I like to just people do that I

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,199
go what are you talking about and they

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,449
go Star Trek and I'm talking about what

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,640
you mean like with the light swords and

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,760
stuff and they go know that Star Wars

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,320
and I said what's the difference and

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,790
they know Scotty beam me up that what

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,940
did that show with the ball guy and they

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,620
don't know and I can't really do it so

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,280
long without cracking a smile but yeah I

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:53,100
like doing that so hmm okay so uh all

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,360
the funny stuff aside hi my name's Scott

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,760
we'll Percy co-branding my topic we just

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,989
talked about optimizing WordPress the

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,030
WordPress running for use for the biddin

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,299
bergen advanced custom fields um

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,830
I submitted this when I did my talk in

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,210
Raleigh and I don't know if you can see

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,250
the fine print it's fine print for a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,310
reason this is actually more than did

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,180
anybody see the you know most of you

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,090
weren't here in Raleigh so probably

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,830
didn't see that oh one other thing I

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,570
want to say two years ago when I spoke

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,890
here last time I almost passed out and

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,479
had to leave the stage and want y'all to

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,310
know I had a muffin

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,560
and to me Oh Gert so I should be okay

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,770
all right so now I'm done with the fun

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,630
stuff

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,700
all right so I learned a lot from when I

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,380
did this in Raleigh so I'm gonna cover

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,869
actually more than what the title says

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,850
so if you were hoping for less I'm sorry

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,200
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,600
through all the somebody's gonna punch

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,159
you in the face with a bunch of data and

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,390
then I'm gonna go into WordPress we're

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,149
gonna look at an example and then we'll

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,520
go through the code again to cover all

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,590
the stuff I'm talking about here so this

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,689
is me is my website Scott's under start

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,670
design I'm a senior front-end developer

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,530
for CCO branding in winston-salem

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,299
I've been doing WordPress development

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,649
for 12 years before that I was an

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,939
illustrator and before that I was an

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,110
apple Harriott systems engineer from

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,030
melon DC in Virginia I've been a without

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,460
instructional technologist

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,720
bounced my way in college and that

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,390
doesn't matter though not pertinent to

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,810
this here's some more of my stuff my

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,340
website code pad stuff dribble Facebook

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,180
other two websites that I do for fun

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,790
dieselpunk industries and pop library

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,400
which I just started that's my website

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,990
here's some stuff I build with WordPress

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,350
corporate sites digital signage so I

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,880
configure the mini PCs people can enter

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,500
the content with WordPress and it

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,040
updates all the machines after they do

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,480
it so will using rest archiving tools

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,800
which is pop library and dieselpunk

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,600
industries that's what those are

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,540
interactive sales presentations this

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,790
slideshow is in WordPress and Brooklyn

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,690
Amazon channels presentation tools which

00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,770
I don't know why I put that in there

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,920
twice because technically that's what

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,690
this is web-based iPad apps which is

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,120
part of the polar bear I'll talk about

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,150
that again and this stuff dreams are

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,260
made of okay this is some of the stuff

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,700
yeah that's cool okay next okay so I'm

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,290
gonna start we're gonna do the basic

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,989
stuff and that's free and that's using

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,780
is anyone here advant how many people

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:27,450
are familiar with advanced custom fields

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:29,010
sweet okay so that's key to this let me

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,510
see then I go to an advanced custom

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,100
fields Pro so I'm gonna start with this

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,260
is a goodness freezing station it's

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,940
gonna actually go from the basic to the

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,640
intermediate and if we have time we'll

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,720
go to the complex where I'm replacing

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,220
Gutenberg entirely but they probably

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,390
don't be doing that so no fun time for

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,370
that okay let's keep going okay so the

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,340
example I'm gonna be using is the pope

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,060
library the latin at the bottom roughly

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,900
translates means books with science and

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,160
adventure if you run it through google

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,290
translate you'll get another translation

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,280
couplet alright so what this consists of

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,260
this consists of a dot PHP file and

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,959
amusing hearings I don't know if you can

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,959
read that uses PHP glob I'm sorry

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,380
yep okay the uses PHP glob to read a

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,500
directory of images and then I pass it a

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,010
variable in the URL and I'm get a little

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,010
bit of feedback

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:40,030
but is that better

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,850
okay a pitch to make back that semen is

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,310
taking care of it it seems to us okay so

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,600
it's a static PHP file that reads a

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,110
director and then spits out all the

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,970
images for that then in WordPress

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,190
there's WordPress part where I've to

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,540
custom post types

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,790
there's the pulp which is a single

00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,990
magazine and then the collection and

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,390
then I'll that spit out on the home page

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,190
I'll go into more of that and prevent

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,680
using feat advanced custom fields I'm

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,940
going to be using a single fields for

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,350
the Pope's or Peter for the Pope

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,420
collection and a repeater for the home

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,030
page you guys from a CFP not repeaters

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,410
all right okay cool

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,870
all right and this is what it looks like

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,330
and here's a quick video this is what

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,920
the Pope reader looks like now it works

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,420
really cool you save this as an iPad app

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,150
and you can read it and it does all this

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,790
cool stuff here so and again this is

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,920
using design mode of slides essentially

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,700
gutted it and had spitting out the PHP

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,010
spitting on all the images so you can do

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,920
that yeah that's cool because man has

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,450
lived too long beneath the yoke of poor

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,550
comic book and others works really good

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,590
with comic books too comic book and pop

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,820
readers and I'm using an ACF the

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,250
relationship field I'm not going to go

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,810
into too much detail about this but if

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,540
you've ever used the plug-in post to

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,400
post and many-to-many this is a really

00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,770
good replacement for that so you can

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,500
actually eliminate an entire plugin I'm

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,730
using the relationship stuff but that's

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,870
part of this okay yeah and and because

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,950
it's my stuff I have to do it for

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,050
clients so have to answer for anybody

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,140
I'm not entirely sure that what I'm

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:21,130
showing you is a good idea so just have

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:22,630
fun I guess okay so let me I'm not sure

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,010
the best way to do this I want to go

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,390
through all of it and I'm gonna go we're

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,590
gonna go look at the WordPress theme you

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,330
think that's gonna work or how do you

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,740
guys anyway I'm gonna go throw it and

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,090
then it was a pretty quick and then

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,230
we'll go and look at it on WordPress all

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,680
right so the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:41,389
modify the functions that PHP file and

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,759
you can see I'm doing an in QM got a

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,520
edmond jeaious and that's only going to

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,490
do two things I've got a incue style

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,430
which that's I'm gonna style the backend

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,990
of it's not really the back in the front

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,190
back in the WordPress and stuff where

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,259
you edit all the crap that's what I'm

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,259
I've found with that and for fun I'm

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,440
including some fonts and if you look the

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,389
material icon from Google because why

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,960
not okay so you'll see what I did that

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:13,190
too all right and this is what it looks

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,509
like by default so this is just your

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,990
standard this is Guttenberg and if we

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,930
look here our ACF stuff is here at the

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,770
bottom so we've got Gutenberg because it

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,050
takes up all the space

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:29,599
and then the ACF stuff at the bottom

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,669
okay so what I did was to alleviate some

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,050
of this stuff I did using krama moment

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,120
too right clicked on all the elements

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,690
that issues with and inspected the

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,259
elements and these are some of the ones

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,550
that had trouble with all right so start

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,780
one it's not really a problem but we're

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,759
going to hide it because we're going to

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,960
hide number essay number three it's

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,900
actually number four it's the middle

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,430
part number two the admin link is too

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,050
close to the update button so with

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,240
Guttenberg whenever I'm hitting the

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,680
Update button I keep hitting dudes

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,029
anybody else do this you actually hit

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,060
the top and it takes you to the admin

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:07,210
section okay so I'm not alone in that

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,979
all right cool solidarity all right and

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,719
that's the oh yeah Gutenberg stood tall

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,599
enforces all the ACF stuff at the bottom

00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,759
and the ACF stuff in my opinion is not

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,289
that obvious

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,419
so it's sort of hidden and one other

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,029
thing I'm assist is we don't use in this

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,639
particular application if you want to

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,259
call it that we don't use the text

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,389
editor all that much the focus is going

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:33,709
to be on the magazine Lister and all the

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:36,229
ACF stuff okay all right and this is my

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,510
WP admin yes file and I'll go over what

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,250
this does exactly but you what and

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,500
clicking on all this stuff the editor

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,079
and all this stuff the editor post

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,540
editor the post wrap area the WPE expand

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,949
all that stuff I'm going to toggle that

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,570
and hide that so what that's going to do

00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:53,149
is I just toggle the main content area

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,329
now I have the classes in there for the

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,389
default

00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:59,429
press editor I'm also going to cover how

00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,439
to add Guttenberg to custom post types

00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:02,579
which it doesn't do by default so some

00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,980
of that you don't need but if you put in

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:07,410
there it's not going to matter and the

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,209
post header toolbar that is this thing

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,009
when we had Guttenberg that's number one

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,049
we're going to hide that when we had the

00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:18,779
Gooden Brooke stuff we're not disabling

00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:21,119
it we're just hiding it okay and this is

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,439
oh yeah this is some of the CSS

00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,970
questions I'm using to hide this stuff

00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:26,069
so the editor that's the display:none

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,779
that's we just saw on that post our

00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:29,549
toolbar that's that little thing over on

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,899
the left the number one that's what that

00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:34,739
is the oh yeah and then when we toggle

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,089
that when we add we're going to add a

00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:38,610
show class so it's going to give it a

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,839
pasty one so we can see it editor and

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,279
it's probably better ways to do this

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,929
some people somebody said you've done

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,610
this with the plug-in yeah but I was on

00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,759
a roll so just kept going with the CSS

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,470
stuff and I setting the post arrow high

00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,569
to maximum height of 50 VH which we

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,069
really don't need to use them that's

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:56,699
that's I'm sure not to do that we

00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:58,709
actually don't do any of this and to do

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:00,179
these to toggle this stuff

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,189
these are my stuff's for the toggle

00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,860
buttons so and then again these are

00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:08,069
built in ACF and this is still the free

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,660
stuff you can do with ACF okay and this

00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:12,389
is what it looks like so I'm using the

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,639
message thing in ACF so here's my toggle

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,230
button you see I did that class admin

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,769
toggle and that's also going to be with

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:25,110
the JavaScript columns and to logout I

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:29,759
I'm doing that class and it's a href to

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,429
the location of the logout button and

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:36,559
that was part of the the top of the part

00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,559
where howdy Scott not that's a hide that

00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:46,459
okay okay so by default and I'm gonna

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,459
minimize this little bit well go whoa

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:57,749
okay so by default somebody correct me

00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,309
if I'm wrong Gutenberg does not it's not

00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:02,100
added to custom post types is that

00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,509
correct okay so what you're going to

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,249
need is this part that's highlighted in

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,990
yellow and that show and rest equals

00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,040
true and then you put your support in

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,300
your Ray so you don't have

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,620
but everything in there that's to show

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,389
everything if you're not going to use

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,389
comments don't put that in if you're not

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,790
using the thumbnail don't put that in

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:19,410
okay and let's see and if you're going

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,759
to add categories which i think is kind

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,430
of weird you have to do the same thing

00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,519
so for my pulp collection I have to do

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,199
show and rest is true so that means I

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,870
can see my categories in many a custom

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,100
post type and you can see that the

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,139
bottom I did not know that at the time

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,649
of work camper Ollie so I didn't talk

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,170
about that then and I think the last

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,810
thing these are the admin CSS classes so

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,279
I'm also going to with that toggle or

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,430
not with the toggle but in the style

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,199
sheet I'm going to hide the left admin

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,420
stuff that you might not want the client

00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:55,110
to see so that your plugins your theme

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,279
editor your themes all that stuff again

00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,199
you can do this with a plug-in but I'm

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,389
doing it in CSS because again I was on a

00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:02,579
roll and the admin bar these are other

00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,810
classes so creating a new post we're not

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,759
going to be using that we're not going

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,889
to be new media nope nope nope nope new

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,319
user no comments nope and all that stuff

00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:12,810
we're not going to be doing any of that

00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:15,240
and this is again this is for like in my

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,010
job I try to build the website so that

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,079
the client does not shoot themselves in

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,880
the foot and yet somehow they keep

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,889
finding the guns and extra ammo and that

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,230
ammo with foot seeking bullets oh ok so

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,579
one other thing about this a release

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,110
that didn't realize that we're can't

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:34,199
probably either is that when you're

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,230
using Guttenberg you can you have a

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,449
block manager which is right here and

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,790
that will remove blocks I don't know if

00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:45,750
you guys knew this but you can whoops

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:47,250
you can remove extra blocks by disabling

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,720
them here so we're going to do that too

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,350
we're going to limit the number of

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,510
blocks because they're not going to oh

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,339
and then I'm also going to hide the

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,490
block manager so they can't go back in

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,430
and add blocks after I've hidden them I

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,250
know it makes me seem like a control

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,600
freak but you know what they do people

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,480
actually call me at 7 o'clock at night

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,130
long cooking dinner so this is all to

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,649
not do that alright so again this is the

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:18,449
default look and the first thing I want

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:20,720
to do is like if we click this what time

00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:20,720
is this

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,740
twelve-thirty okay cool I got plenty of

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:32,530
time any are there any questions so far

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,370
before I do this am I making sense okay

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:43,100
if not you're not gonna hurt my feelings

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:43,460
a lot maybe I don't know sorry about

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,700
that

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:51,170
and let it and the reason I'm doing this

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,990
now because I'm gonna switch teams and

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,660
it's going to cut everything off so I'm

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,160
going to click this going to go into

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,220
mine now once you learn like remember

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,050
this block manager right alright so I'm

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,610
going to it also has other things but I

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,290
think it's worth it to hide it if you're

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,660
trying to protect your clients so I'm

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,190
just going to cut off everything and

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,440
then I'm going to select only this stuff

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,700
I want them to be able to see because

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,140
we're not gonna be using shortcode in

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,140
this we're not gonna be using in beds

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,180
okay cool

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,230
all right oh whoops I need to add

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,530
something there because they're not me

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,110
but I did anything alright so

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:44,390
manager so we're going to use paragraphs

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:45,830
and header and I guess maybe code they

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,390
can't too much damage with that yeah

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,250
they can actually but why not all right

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,660
and cut just so you can see it alright

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,890
so I'm just gonna leave those six things

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,390
and you're gonna have a seventh and

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,400
that's the reusable blocks but we want

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,780
to keep that all right so now if we look

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:04,340
at this when the add stuff they only see

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:06,400
these things nope

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,360
they will not they will not be able to

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,950
nope it only should matter of fact if I

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,110
look for what's another name that's

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:17,150
missing here embed or invite not gonna

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:25,220
find that either so embed they just see

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:27,380
custom so no that's gone too behold all

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,790
right so we're good with that I'm gonna

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,500
click update although I didn't change

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,360
anything all right one other thing I

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,730
want to say this like this is

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,879
is the font they're using for this am i

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:41,989
the client side whatever the front end

00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,220
the website it's - right and I hope I'm

00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:47,119
pronouncing that right the fine all

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,790
right so now and I've said a couple of

00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:51,850
different themes this is a default one

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:59,420
so now it's switched not theme editor

00:15:51,850 --> 00:16:01,369
excuse me I'm going to switch to three

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,589
now watch what happens boom

00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:07,879
so we lost like 50% of the sidebar they

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,129
can only clear the cache if they're

00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,819
going to add something new they can only

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:16,299
do this now if I'm in there and I need

00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:18,829
to get to like so if we go WP dash admin

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:23,350
so all that CSS stuff that I had in the

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:26,209
earlier that's what this was okay

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:31,160
so if we go to our pages we see this

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:33,350
there's our and we edit this and back to

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,989
your question what happens when they do

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,749
that they go to the block editor it's

00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:42,350
gone yeah because in the CSS that I did

00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:46,369
back in my presentation I used the the

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:50,029
last so if you look at this components

00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:51,829
in child 2 to being in child 2 is next

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,879
to last that one so if they go and

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:55,959
change things I might have to change

00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,959
this but for right now

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,329
I did you mean the WordPress editor no I

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:13,470
did it but I did it on when I was

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,209
building the thing you can but uh yeah I

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,820
don't I don't typically like that it

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,040
stuff from WordPress on the backend I

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,079
did here because nothing else works what

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,220
did it want was not the cabin I was

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,260
staying after okay so here we see that

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,480
we don't see the Guttenberg stuff um now

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,700
I've hidden alright notice we can't

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,590
accidentally take ourselves to the back

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,420
end and over here we have our toggle

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,380
content and our logout buttons now if

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,630
you don't want to show that you can do

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,890
that and again that is all in advance

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,150
custom pills probably need to switch

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,760
back so you can see how it did that well

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:49,260
Eddie she ate it but so there now we see

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,000
our Gutenberg stuff there's LR and we

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,530
notice that the stars show up because we

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,020
included the Montserrat and the

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:02,960
materials icon so manning custom font

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,400
styles to the backing editor of this so

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,340
alright so we toggle the content if I

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,630
want log out click that so they can

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,790
still log out you can still log out from

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,160
if you're if you do view page

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,530
I also eliminated some stuff from the

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,060
from the what is the front-end this is

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,240
technically is this the front edge the

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,550
back end this is the but you're I'm a

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,940
front-end developer but I'm editing the

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,320
backend and you would think like I've

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
been doing this for 12 years you think I

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,640
would know the difference alright so we

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,990
see new we eliminated page would you see

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,190
Popham or not because we're not using

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:41,600
post or anything like that yeah I did

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:44,700
that CSS I forgot to add that too yeah

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,850
so yeah if it had like 15 it's got an

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,950
opacity of zero so when you roll over it

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,960
gives it a full opacity and it gives it

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,700
had a negative value up so then it

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,180
slides down and you and you set your

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,650
body to position absolute top left zero

00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,370
and that because sometimes you'll get

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,050
that gap

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,190
unless I'm generating this I don't want

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,170
to see it because it throws it off by

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,500
putting that you know 30 pixel 40 pixel

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:10,640
gap in between there so yeah and now if

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,640
I go back edit page

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,310
all right so let's go look at the pulp

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,080
section so like I was saying this

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:24,550
consists of oh yeah so let's all right

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,130
so let's add a pulp so we're going to

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,460
you actually use this alright so I'm

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,630
going to add an issue of captain future

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,110
all right and there's our categories

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,600
right there

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,840
all right so in have a text document

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,450
open I'm going to talk about captain

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,240
future alright so I'm gonna add a

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,470
nineteen so the way this is you know

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,300
I've uploaded I've got a directory

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,330
called pulps and all I need to do this

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,760
is use okay so this is this is again

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,010
advanced custom fields I'm not bringing

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,510
over the Gutenberg sod over to this

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,920
because we don't need it so there's no

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,610
toggle we're not going to be adding any

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:04,000
text with this we just need these three

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,950
fields here so and I'm not counting the

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,410
title because that's a default so I'm

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,520
using that I'm putting in the link and

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:14,560
this is going to spit out the URL for

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,130
the Pope and I'm gonna put in the

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,540
publication date is whoops man I hate it

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:27,550
with this because if we get is in back

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:29,050
out command zero thank you okay and

00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,850
there it is that's no it's not the

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,850
publication date that would be July 1943

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,620
and my thumbnail which already did oh

00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,360
and one thing you see this little arrow

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,400
beside the Select you don't see that

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,390
because if you if I were to go in here

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,970
and hit edit and I were to go to I'm

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:57,940
gonna make this 399 and then scale and

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,250
then click back well nevermind because

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,510
usually it would see there was a little

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,700
square with nothing in it so out of the

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,600
little arrow but that was because the

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,150
client complained about it alright and

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,950
I'm gonna sign this to a category and

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:17,410
that is going to be kept in the future

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,790
and then publish okay now that we've

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:24,380
created our single pop we're going to

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:27,789
add this to a pulp collection

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:36,400
and so these are all my poke collections

00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:41,630
and I'm gonna do by give a title ABCD

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,039
see you kept in future okay now again we

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,360
do have it's going to show up like the

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,910
home page did alright so right now we

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,049
don't see Gutenberg yet but also added

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:52,549
some CSS to my ACF stuff so then helps

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:54,350
differentiate between so we've got it

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,450
colored sort of like the Brazilian money

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,720
palette I guess you'd call it the

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,710
pastels so it's 43 so we know it's 1943

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,090
so I'm gonna do put in my category so

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,890
it's going in that category that added

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,350
in the pulps it's only going to show

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,730
kept in future issues and I sort change

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,929
the nomenclature because I was building

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,870
this one try to do it but another it's

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:18,860
40 307 alright now I'm gonna click

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,600
update now I want to add content to this

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,950
because like typically you're not gonna

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,860
add a lot of content so that's why

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,929
Gutenberg is not first and foremost in

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,429
this most 90% the time we're going to

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,640
just be adding pulps to this you're

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:35,000
going to rarely use the text editor so

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,960
I've got my copy for that over here so

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,070
let me just take this here and paste

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,650
this in and there we go so there it is

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,419
automatically adding my blocks to that

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,429
and not have to do anything so ya know

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,530
this was taken from Wikipedia some

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:59,150
totally ripping them off just for this

00:22:51,530 --> 00:23:00,830
example alright and update oh and now

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,270
when I was doing that the example I was

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,460
using when it's talking about the object

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,340
ID that's when I go through and I'm

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,809
finding the magazine issue that's using

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,169
an object ID or no that's used in

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,250
relationship so if you I'll go back and

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,020
we'll look at ACF and I'll show you how

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,270
that works but this is my copy on

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,650
Captain Future these are the issues and

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:25,130
if we go to 1943 this is the one I added

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,960
here and if we want to look at this it

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,669
will launch the static alright so this

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,740
is the URL I'm talking about where it

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,059
says question mark issue equals kept in

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,220
future that's what's telling it which

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:36,920
directory to go to and pull all the

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:44,450
issues out so you get this really cool

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:46,600
pop reader thingy you got the and so I

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,780
sorta took some design cues from the

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,880
Nook can I know it's not popular as the

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,110
other one what the Kendall but or what

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,470
was it the Kendall I remember one or the

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,520
other

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,750
all right so we go back okay so that's

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,010
that works now that we've created our

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,809
pop collection we want to add this is

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:11,299
the home page so let me go to my pages

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:13,700
edits and our magazine Lister again

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,780
we're not adding any content oh no we

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,500
don't have to do that because it's

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,160
already been done once we update that we

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,840
go to the home page

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,299
oh the meet yeah then I should have gone

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,750
back and done that again alright so if

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm adding a collection here I would go

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,150
let me delete kept in the future here

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,150
and add it again

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:44,110
let me delete this and again this is

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,680
just a repeater and it's going in

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:50,430
between captain Satan and captain hazard

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:54,040
which where else would you put him

00:24:50,430 --> 00:25:02,170
wait is that right ABCDEF g oh no sorry

00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:06,180
goes before captain hazard oh I keep at

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:14,130
sorry sorry sorry until it added remove

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:14,130
and kept in future

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:30,320
and we go down here and we'll see

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,970
captain future and we are still getting

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,770
the copy that we put in on the page so

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,600
it's pulling in the the now I'm only

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,240
specifying that pulls in that pick the

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,460
content field and this stuff in our 1943

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,830
issue is right there the one with the

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:47,750
lady in the bird dude whatever not the

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,050
most plausible of scenarios all right uh

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:58,040
any questions anything you let me to go

00:25:51,050 --> 00:26:01,010
into more detail about on this oh yeah

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,140
absolutely let me go back into my so we

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,960
can get to that so if you need to go

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,720
back to if we go to theme if you using

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,490
CSS because the theme still exists I can

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,990
do this and go back and activate the

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:17,510
original one that will yeah but not that

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,680
not what the client sees so I mean not

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,180
with the constants the client will still

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:27,920
see this not what the people looking at

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:29,750
the website see except for all the the

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,580
the dumb crap I did a few minutes ago

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:38,210
yeah yeah okay so custom fields let's

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:41,270
look at this so if we're going to look

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,730
at the collection builder I believe it's

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,410
what it's called again I used when I

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,060
when I first bought hopefully I was

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,340
surprised that poplar library was

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,340
available so I had to buy it because

00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:02,180
okay so let's see issues all right so if

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,490
we look here a relationship issues all

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,170
right and we're filtering by so it's

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,390
it's an advanced custom field so you're

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:11,270
going to go in you add your field and it

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,790
is issue is what I called it it's a

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,160
relationship and we're going to select a

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,780
post type which is just Paul that's the

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,260
only one we're going to and we're not

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,520
going to be the used sex on amis because

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,970
that will let you look at other stuff

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,470
we're not really using them and search

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,300
and insects I mean that's the categories

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,680
we added so there we go and we're not

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,490
using a featured image and we're doing

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,220
the post object alright so that's what

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:42,650
that does so if we go to our scene

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:45,710
Oh parents just so we can look at what

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,330
that looks like and part of this one I

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,490
did it's like I built a one of the

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,960
websites I built the ad builder using

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,850
the same methodology so you create your

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,360
ad and then you can go in and add a

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:59,210
group of ads and things like that when

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,420
you're putting ACF stuff within ACF

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,100
stuff good lord it's you get lost

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,270
because you're drilling down down and

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,830
you're keeping it like the same name

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,290
you're using the sub field although it's

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:13,370
inside something it is inside the sub

00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:22,280
field so that but let me sit where I

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:24,260
confirm this I think it's a test builder

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:30,610
because either way they're gonna

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:30,610
essentially do the same thing okay so oh

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,400
it's a builder dot PHP

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,830
yes I pulled it up because there's a

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,770
separate thing yeah I know I should be

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,190
using git template part but yeah all

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:49,790
right so I set this up make this a

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,350
little bit bigger so we're going to

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,850
query post in this case it's pop

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,910
collection and negative one so we're

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:59,840
going to include as many so not going

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:06,410
over that part the head and then the ACC

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,180
body and then weight this one oh yeah no

00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,770
no that's no that's parts correct it's

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,330
the collection builder part so that's

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,060
our so filled as the collection builder

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,330
that's that's the repeater and then the

00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:19,420
covers and then the year and then okay

00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,790
so right here get so field issues if

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,550
outpost and then so you're doing this so

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,190
this the the issues thing this is where

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,900
it's doing the relationship stuff and by

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,330
default when you see other above it the

00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,980
ones being pulled in so you can pull in

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,810
like for 1943 they're multiple ones you

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,790
can click those and it puts it inside

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,790
this loop so you're only seeing the ones

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:43,610
that you click for that particular year

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,580
when you add them and that's what this

00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:49,010
is doing inside the pulp item instead

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,550
actually it's inside this part right

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,810
here from here to where the 4hn

00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,670
so it's inside a loop and that's why

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,700
you're able to show each issue that you

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,500
click shows up in that thing but this is

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,700
like refusing post to post in mini to me

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,830
in relationships you're doing that

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:10,280
that's what this does so you can

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:13,340
essentially replace that plugin um any

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:25,210
questions so if this seems a bit

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:25,210
disjointed okay okay so one last thing

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm sort of hesitant all right so a

00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,740
little hesitant to show you this because

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,300
it's sort of some I'm working on but I

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,560
don't know if it's not show you anyway

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:46,480
because we had how much time do we have

00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:46,480
left okay

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,930
and this I'm not going to go into a lie

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,300
to tell how I did this I just think it's

00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,920
pretty freaking cool alright so if we go

00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,720
back to my presentation and I said if we

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,320
have time so I rented by here familiar

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,100
with ready Mac nobody has anybody here

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,260
familiar with Adobe spark okay so yeah

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:14,630
so essentially Elementor does what adobe

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:16,580
spark does what about let me see so ACF

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,400
we've talked about Elementor here's

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,970
familiar with Elementor how do y'all

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,970
feel about it

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:29,180
better than visual composer all right in

00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,820
the dough I don't know how much should

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,920
we badmouth the other I've had to use a

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,620
lot of stuff I've used a V and this is

00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,180
when we have clients like our some of

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,620
them want stuff fast and they're cheap

00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,440
and so you have to pick the best

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,450
solution for them and you know usually

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,460
like lift my own devices I'll build it

00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:50,420
myself but Elementor is the only one

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,980
that I think gives the client the that

00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,800
gives them a quality product and it's

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,240
quick for us to build so what I did was

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,590
this kind of expensive solution is like

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,620
four and fifty dollars to do this I

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:07,370
think but using a CF Pro elemental Pro

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:09,050
and slides I built this so when Adobe

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,210
came out with the magazine stuff when

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,710
the iPad first came out that's cool

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,710
because it's not one to build like an

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,240
online magazine like you can meif used

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,590
to do with the I forget what it was

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,710
called you'd build it with Adobe

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,700
InDesign

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:26,810
why aren't stuff like that was but with

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,800
that okay so this is slides and this is

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,930
the same thing I built then it's a

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,360
little bit sluggish on this but you go

00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,760
through you go the cool stuff here and

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,460
then you see the cool animations these

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,600
are slides animations this is not

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:43,580
Elementor and add some slides of

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,430
framework it's design made by company

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,170
called design moto and I think they just

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,540
like some weird licensing thing I think

00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,810
it's like $140 but essentially I get the

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:56,870
HTML CSS and I take it up Oh a little

00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,640
bit about me so I do stuff like this

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,050
Ivan I've worked for CCO Brennan have

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,460
another office in Greensboro where I do

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,630
freelance stuff and a lot of times I go

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,450
on the weekend I

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,160
see what I can cram in WordPress this is

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:13,070
something I crammed in WordPress just

00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:14,809
for fun so if we click this we get the

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:22,390
there's a modal window so we can watch

00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:25,780
the trailer for that damn it

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:28,070
sorry for the potty mouth all right and

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,809
so you get these cool transitions like

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,360
this I got this background then this is

00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:34,850
just stupid you know placement cut but

00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,669
you got the cool scaling effect so you

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:41,320
look at this it scales up I'm using

00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:43,610
custom fonts that is using the Gutenberg

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,520
when you do the typography settings and

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:51,190
things like that so if we pop this out a

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,190
full screen so the way this works is

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,720
and it

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,010
there we go

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,090
is with you for me with Guttenberg you

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,310
can build templates now this was good in

00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,470
Brooke Pro so what I did was I went and

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:40,460
I built a series of templates in

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,790
elementary yeah what did I say oh I'm

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,060
sorry

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,940
Elementor and over here we get these ID

00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,070
numbers the four nine six four six seven

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,720
right so if we look at one of these I'm

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,130
gonna look at the one for Matt Baker a

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,110
comic book artist an african-american

00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:01,220
comic book artist from North Carolina by

00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:03,350
the way was born here so we get a sample

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,000
of so this I created like one simple

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,700
slide from slides and this is what it

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:14,420
looks like but if we do let me go back

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:18,910
and I do edit and what was my Baker out

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,910
here we go edit with Elementor

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:34,390
sorry it's taking a while there we go so

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,090
we get a full drop and drag editor so I

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,800
can go in here and click on my blocks

00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,370
like if I want to change the width on

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,820
this column width that should be you

00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:48,690
know I can do that I can go in and

00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,690
delete stuff

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,330
add new stuff drag stuff around whoops

00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,430
so to me this is sort of some of the way

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,440
we do things and well I say it's a

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,820
colleague illustrator but not really and

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,800
I think if I grab it right here in the

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,460
middle I can pull it out and change the

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,080
width like that and then add new images

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,550
stuff like that and add these individual

00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,890
blocks go in and change the typography

00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,210
just go nuts doing this and I'm not

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,850
going to save this all right so that's

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:25,330
one thing I built in Elementor I'm not

00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:28,870
going to save that then if I go to the

00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,280
home page what I'm doing is I'm taking

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:37,260
each one of these and putting it within

00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,260
slides the loop so if I go here edit

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,900
all right and so here's our page builder

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,540
and so I'm doing this into the same

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,250
thing I did on the other one let's see

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,540
where that bakers next-to-last so I can

00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,340
go here and I click it's gonna go

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:03,290
through all my templates that I created

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,150
and I'm gonna select Matt Baker and then

00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,830
I can do like template settings whoops

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,040
it's Carolyn bar that is not met baker

00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:11,480
looked too vastly different people not

00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,120
using a background image with this one

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,520
and I can have set the slide fade saying

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,870
that's the slide thing now I have

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,750
effects over here so I'm gonna switch

00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:25,330
this over to Zen and this is how the

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,330
slides transition when I go between them

00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:36,460
so where they were sliding before now

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,660
we're getting a different transit I

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,680
don't know if you guys will notice that

00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,940
but anyway yeah and it's the now this

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
was done the same way this is using the

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,750
same object ID we're using the other

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,250
ones if we go to our custom fields we

00:37:49,750 --> 00:38:03,090
get by passing Guttenberg all together

00:37:51,250 --> 00:38:07,950
because we're not really using it and I

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:12,130
don't build templates in elements the

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:14,710
you mean like it for this particular

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,230
case yeah I am an element or does a cool

00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,850
thing where it lets you save like chunks

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,380
of template so use it over again so the

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,390
titles and things like that I'm going

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,700
and put those individual parts in and

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,990
use them over again I can change the

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,460
text it won't you know it'll it'll

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,260
retype but it will keep the same textile

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:33,430
and there's this other thing where you

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,810
can copy a a template element you can do

00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,130
copy and then you go to another one and

00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,140
you can do copy style and it will copy

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,610
over the other CSS changes you created

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,610
from element right that's really cool so

00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,030
yeah so that this is the again this is

00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,500
what I'm saying this is what sort of

00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,240
cost me my job because they didn't need

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,860
me to do development really and they

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,030
didn't need me to do design anymore and

00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,410
then it feel bad about that because I

00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,820
was kind of tired over there anyway and

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:03,010
they really didn't need me I'd been

00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,750
there for 12 years so it was time yes so

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,760
no there was actually no animosity I was

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,160
family they said you know we're cutting

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,280
ties I'm okay I got a job interview on

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,530
Tuesday so but I also got like severance

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,810
too so I'm glad you know I hate it that

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:20,910
was I like two months severance for that

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:23,650
oh and then one thing up or is it the

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,630
the slide ID okay that's not the slide

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,950
ID it is the I'm trying to find oh there

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,380
it is that's where again it's the

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,310
template name that's the post object so

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,290
we're looking at that and I'm specifying

00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,540
that we're using template is that is

00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:37,360
what we're using so that's the Elementor

00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,520
template and and that in that particular

00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,930
case I'm using the part of a post ID

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,650
versus the post object if you're using

00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,930
relationships using the post object

00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,150
and and they essentially do the same

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,010
thing this one doesn't isn't gonna do a

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,270
repeater like the other one did you're

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,400
not going to get I don't want to select

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:57,480
one from july-august like we did in the

00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,550
pulp thing so I hope you know were able

00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,440
to take something from this I don't it I

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,700
don't know I've been doing this for 12

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,650
years so I do this stuff announce

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,520
anybody it and I don't mean this to brag

00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,720
like I don't see anybody else doing this

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,190
so I don't know if this is a

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,650
particularly good idea if any of the

00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,550
stuff I'm doing is particularly smart I

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:20,010
don't have anything to compare it

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:21,450
against so but again that's not I'm

00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:26,010
trying to say it so I don't look like an

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:28,830
arrogant pompous ass is I do this all I

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:31,800
do this for fine and so again it's a

00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,730
good idea I don't know I think it's kind

00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,160
of cool whatever

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm sorry I didn't mean to ramble any

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:48,830
other questions about this yeah cool I'm

00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,780
glad you liked it another thing we do

00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:56,630
this is I did built this the exact same

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,630
way so my presentation is a series of

00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,940
because this was all built with drop and

00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,360
drag too so if it ever gets to the back

00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,610
end so there it is there's me there's

00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,920
all my slides so I'm multi slide and

00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:14,130
that was I got this from I think Cody

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,300
house it's you know took some everything

00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,560
we do in WordPress is a wordpress

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,990
developer we're standing on the

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,840
shoulders of giants meaning other people

00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,860
have done the hard work and it's sort of

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,290
like the same thing they said in

00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:31,440
Jurassic Park except if my stuff breaks

00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:32,850
breaks dinosaurs don't eat everybody but

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,230
so I went when I color coded this it

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,610
made easier to see I've got you know the

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,440
multi slide and then seamless slide

00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,800
stuff so it took somebody else's work

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,300
and then crammed it into WordPress with

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,100
the help of somebody else's stuff so I'm

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,870
using like every stuff everybody else

00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:52,350
has built and then doing very little

00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:53,820
work on my part so it was yeah it's and

00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,200
I think I don't know where I got it from

00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,539
it seemed like it's in my github

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,249
repository so that's a

00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:00,749
oh you oh by the way if you want to look

00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:05,099
at this again if you want to relive the

00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:07,079
magic its presentations that Scott

00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,799
Saunders design that's where I put it

00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:15,419
and I should give it a name but so but

00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:16,589
that's where this is so and that may

00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:17,969
change if I do another work because

00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:20,699
that's a subdomain I set up and all that

00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:23,429
stuff so well cool thanks for coming and

00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:33,869
hope you hope it was something you were

00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:35,880
able to take from it yeah I'll let

00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:38,069
WordCamp Asheville to that so Abby's got

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,919
son of such WordCamp ash well I think it

00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:42,149
