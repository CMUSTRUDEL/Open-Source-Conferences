so this is fun I'm a little nervous

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,860
actually

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,039
but hi I'm Joanna I'm gonna say it again

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,779
anyway Joanna how you say it my last

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,970
name was originally Smith so my parents

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,210
were like let's be clever we'll throw Y

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,970
in Joanna so anyways that's how my name

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,800
is pronounced and I'm gonna tell you a

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,760
little bit about my background okay

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,260
also I'm gonna figure out how to talk

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:38,160
into a microphone alright let's see if

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,840
this thing works how do I make the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,770
clicker work this is great ah perfect we

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,789
got stuff all right fine I did it okay

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,180
so um I've been doing a lot of different

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,309
things in the past ten years at like 19

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,010
or something I started doing screen

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:13,049
printing I'm also nervous I'm like

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:15,630
shaking anyways yeah alright cool so

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,820
yeah I made t-shirts yeah

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,280
lots of t-shirts like I did you know

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,909
screen printing doing graphic design so

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,619
that's all related I swear so I've done

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,240
that and then after I did that for a bit

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,770
I was like you know what I really like

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,630
graphic design this is great I'm gonna

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,970
go to school for that so then I started

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,920
working at a digital marketing firm that

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,329
makes websites they weren't using

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,799
WordPress but then the next one I worked

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,380
at they were using WordPress so I

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,119
started using WordPress then yeah so

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,799
then from there after a really long time

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,259
I was like you know what I really like

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,520
code I want to get into code so there

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,049
are a couple things that have shaped my

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,460
outlook on typography and one of them is

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,960
printmaking because you're able to look

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,299
at the actual letter forms you're able

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,299
to see it actually printed so moving

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,280
from that into working with like a as a

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,439
graphic designer making websites and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,570
having these different responsive states

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,849
where you you have a break point at you

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,240
know however many places I think at the

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,100
time we were doing like six

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,990
different break points which was really

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,670
weird especially coming from a design

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,590
background because you're like oh man I

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,390
took all this time to lay out this

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,370
beautiful type and put it in the right

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,980
space and make sure it's beautiful and

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,080
now it's gonna get weird and then

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,090
sometimes if it's a pixel or two bigger

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,130
than the breakpoint all of that type is

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,080
gonna look incredibly different so

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,600
that's a little bit of what shaped my

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,840
understanding of using the web and using

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,750
typography so from there as a developer

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,190
I'm really really interested in fluid

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:48,810
typography so that's the basic summary

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:52,870
yeah oh wow this is great

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,940
hmm how do we make any of this work all

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,770
right I'm just gonna we're going with it

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,510
all right so what we have in the middle

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,940
is a printing press and like I was

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,320
saying I've worked with print before

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,380
I've actually worked with something

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,230
similar to this and this over here is a

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,220
glyph and it has a letter on top of it

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,260
and so what we used to do what we used

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,850
to do is we used to line up type we

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,980
would line it up and then we've put

00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,720
spacers between and we would have all

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,220
this ready to go and then we would print

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,740
on top of it so this is kind of like

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,090
where typography started to become what

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,290
it is today because we started looking

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,630
at these letter forms and really

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,490
thinking about what are we making like

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,660
why is this readable what are the

00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,930
different things we can do with it

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,280
how can we be really creative and so a

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,290
lot of the fundamentals come from the

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,880
very beginning whenever we were doing

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,770
this and we were laying out letters so

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm gonna geek out for a second I don't

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,010
know if you've heard of the hot metal

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,010
typesetting but it's ridiculous you

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,620
basically have a keyboard and you it's

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,260
like a basically like an old typewriter

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,820
and you hit these keys and the blocks of

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,090
letters come out into the Machine and

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,320
line up on this slug and then hot metal

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,510
is poured in the background of this

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,360
machine and then afterwards you have

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,530
your lineup type and it's crazy for the

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,330
time period that they were able to do

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,040
this there's totally a documentary on it

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,420
I watched it in design school when it

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,220
was really fun so yeah

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,410
all right so this is type so what we're

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,900
looking at are all these letters and

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,330
they had different ways of lining up and

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,340
we've learned a ton about the way we

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,210
read and how we're able to take in

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,860
information from this process okay

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,080
so we're really excited about type

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,060
whereas lining up things we're thinking

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,820
about stuff like grids and how these

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,230
things fit together and as we're doing

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,330
it we start to come up with all these

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,280
different rules and that's where you get

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,310
design fundamentals that's where you're

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,140
pulling in like letting kerning tracking

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,110
all of that all those concepts come from

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,240
this so this is a baseline grid it's one

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,640
of the best things one of the design

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,680
firms I have worked at I actually had to

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,050
lay out like a hundred page book and it

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,730
was a lot of work but one of the things

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,470
that really saved me was the baseline

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,300
grid because when you have a two column

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,770
layout having everything on the same

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,660
baseline makes it easier for the reader

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,919
your eye just tracks right over to the

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,620
next line without there being as much

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,100
trouble so we're thinking about all of

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,370
this and there's a huge difference

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,890
between legibility and readability so

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,300
the ability to distinguish letterforms

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,210
so like the difference between like a

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,800
lowercase J or a lowercase P or a

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,060
lowercase Q and like all of the things

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,830
that you're looking at your eye is

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,800
picking up on all of that

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,560
that's why certain typefaces are

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,090
definitely more readable than others but

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,160
there's a difference between that and

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,990
then there's an actually having type or

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,120
design that affects the ability to make

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,700
it understood so there's a huge

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,930
difference and your priority might

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,630
really change the way you design

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,940
something okay

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,380
so let's start talking about type all

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,419
right so I've talked to you about

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,370
baseline that's what that makes a lot of

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,979
sense and then there's also letting and

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,680
kerning so letting is the distance

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,940
between the type and then kerning is the

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,410
distance between each letter so the

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,360
reason why that's important is because

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,860
certain things will be much harder to

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,919
read than others based off of that

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,229
letting and it's really important

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,229
especially at the time for newspapers

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,110
and different books making things

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,210
accessible for everyone all right so

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,130
here's tracking tracking is the dis

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,830
it's between letters and kerning is

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,289
where you can precisely put two letters

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,759
closer together based off of like the V

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,009
and the a that space is a little bit

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,470
different so going back to typography

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,190
going back to the different blocks that

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,669
were using and letterpress in general

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:51,780
what they had to do was put tiny pieces

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:53,789
of lead in between everything so because

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,940
of that we have a really strong

00:06:53,789 --> 00:07:02,340
understanding of what works and what

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:05,460
doesn't work so this is where we start

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,280
to think about what we should do and

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,289
what we shouldn't do as designers for

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,669
people to be able to take away the

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,590
information that you're wanting them to

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,470
take away and one of the things we talk

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,180
about is line length like if you've ever

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,340
been on a web site where you literally

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,099
had to turn your head to finish reading

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,810
it I'm not gonna read that web site for

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,389
very long I mean maybe some people will

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,250
but that's just not a thing it's the

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,380
same for why they we have double column

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,750
layouts in print or why whenever you're

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,180
working on a book you don't make your

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,729
text span the entire page if it's a very

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,479
large book so these are all things we're

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:44,599
learning and okay so this down here is

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,430
what we call a display font and

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,590
basically it's a font that's really

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,930
interesting has a lot to it but it would

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,270
be very taxing on your eyes to read lots

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,099
of that display font for a long period

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,110
of time because your brain has to take

00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,550
all of that information in has to take

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,949
in all of those different letter forms

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,780
similar to what I just talked about

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:08,250
legibility readability different things

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,440
so another problem is that if text is

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,550
too small it's hard to read because you

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,110
can't see the shape of the letters

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,639
you're not able to distinguish your a

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,259
senders and B centers that's just the

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,110
part that goes above and below the

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,969
letter so that's really frustrating and

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,530
if it's too big it's hard to read

00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,180
because the horizontal flow isn't there

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,150
your brain is just breaking up in tiny

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,490
little pieces so all of these concepts

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:33,180
have been in print for a very long time

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:37,229
so as a designer when you come into web

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,640
and you're writing breakpoints you know

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,620
you're asking your developer to write

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,080
breakpoints where your font goes down a

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,959
couple

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,570
here and there like four four devices

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,490
it's very frustrating because you feel

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,640
like you have to let go of a lot of what

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,700
makes design good design like you have

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,700
to really be okay with sometimes your

00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,610
font looks like this and it's what you

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,640
know so yeah because basically it'd be

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,190
like if you had a book and every single

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,860
page in the book was at different size

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:17,230
and you never change the font so it all

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:19,990
just gets really weird in and out so we

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,019
have taken a few things from design and

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,290
regular typography standards into web

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:29,620
and they are letting which is now called

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:34,240
line height and tracking which is letter

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,510
spacing so these work pretty well it's

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,829
kind of nice to be able to set these but

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,560
especially if you're working with letter

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:43,720
spacing and you set like a unit that's

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,940
standard it's gonna be that throughout

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,430
the entire site no matter the font size

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:55,089
like it's gonna be always so many pixels

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:56,980
which is a little bit weird okay so the

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,120
purpose of design I'm just gonna read

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,029
the green text because I don't like

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,640
reading large Thanks

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,160
thought needs to be given to how a user

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,079
reader viewer will approach the task of

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,720
obtaining the information from the

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:16,390
design so a huge concept in design is

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,149
user flow and not user flow as in UX

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,579
like your actual eyes going down the

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,260
page where the hierarchy is what you're

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,470
supposed to be looking at and how you're

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,779
delivering that information and using

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,120
typography and using hierarchy like

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,980
headings headings and things like that

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,870
that's how you get them moving through

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,850
the page it's how we know what to read

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:41,440
and when to read it alright so I'm gonna

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,269
show you some really great examples of

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,250
typography on the web where it's done

00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,199
really well because I think that we are

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,690
doing typography beautifully throughout

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:52,270
the web and I'm not really talking about

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,370
that exactly but anyways I love these

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,100
because they look like print it really

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,509
looks like

00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,579
someone has a poster and this is a em

00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,250
okay so this is beautiful web type from

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,050
hello happy and it's using all google

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,089
fonts so they're all free and I love

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,190
seeing that because you know you did

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,660
really inspired by things that you know

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,889
you can use and that if you just have a

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,540
little bit of design background a little

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,040
bit of ability you can really make it

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,519
look nice like it looks like a very

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,800
expensive typeface that somebody bought

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:25,550
so yeah so here's another example of

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,550
that and I love this one in particular

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,829
because it really looks like a book like

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,199
wow that's that's on the web that's so

00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:36,889
easy to read like how does that respond

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:38,990
you know so um yeah it's really an

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,699
interesting thing and of course I have

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,240
to end on Jean son and Jen Simmons

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,860
because her website is beautiful the

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:52,569
typography is gorgeous and it really

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:54,680
does look like a poster yeah so alright

00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:57,310
another thing that we've taken from

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,370
print that we've put into web is ends

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:05,240
right so when you see it in web it's en

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,160
but when we used it in print we were

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,110
taking the letter N and we were looking

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,550
at the size of that letter and that's a

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,910
unit why would we want to do that

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:17,060
because it's responsive whenever we had

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,769
big blocks of type the glyph with the

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,230
letter on top of it we wanted something

00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,699
that was relative to that typeface we

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,990
didn't want something that was a

00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,519
different typeface that might be a lot

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,750
bigger and use that unit we wanted

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,329
something that would stay within that

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,269
typeface that we could reuse and so we

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:38,180
came up with ends ends are pretty great

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:40,220
so on the left is also an M but the

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,959
difference is that sometimes ends are

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,370
full width and sometimes they aren't and

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,620
so that's one of the distinctions

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,949
between ends and print and ends and on

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,210
the web because not every typeface has

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,700
an M

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:55,550
didn't matter before the internet but if

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,899
we're taking ends into web then yeah we

00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,790
definitely need something that's not

00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,960
going to work if we need something

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,190
better this is obviously not going to

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,890
work for you know Arabic and Chinese so

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,250
what we came up with was using a point

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,899
size and so the point size of the font

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,910
whatever that is that is now what we

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,770
call a mess

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,800
okay so I'm putting all this together

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,560
there's a lot going on here but I'm

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,300
coming from print I'm looking at web

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,520
where we're using it now like typography

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,700
on the web and I'm thinking well that's

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,560
great we actually have a relative unit

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:35,420
like we can actually use that for things

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,860
that's really interesting so yeah in CSS

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,140
we use em so this is just explaining it

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,779
further all right but we also have REMS

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,440
so REMS versus MS they're very different

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:48,050
right so quran' is basing off off of the

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,330
root element which is always going to be

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,700
the same size and M is basing it off of

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,620
the element that it's inside right okay

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,620
so let's walk this back for a second

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,810
let's go back to our book all right

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,540
because basically we're designing four

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,570
different books right so what we're

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,690
saying is that type size can change it

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,220
can grow and shrink based off of the

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,910
book based off of the page of that book

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:17,209
so that's what that's why fluid type is

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,220
so dynamic because you can set up a

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,830
typographic scale so that way whenever

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,770
you have like the smallest phone your

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,180
font is roughly the same size so that

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,279
really helps whenever we're sitting here

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,290
you know as designers like we're sitting

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,730
at our desks we're setting up hierarchy

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,680
we're putting it all together we're

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,089
trying our best to show like a user flow

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,760
and get people moving through the page

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,940
and it'd be really great if all of that

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,190
work was sustainable or it just

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,029
sustained at all right so this is from

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:49,070
CSS tricks and basically I'll post all

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,600
of these but this is there's a lot of

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,250
different ways to do fluid typography

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,680
this is one of the methods that I really

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,709
liked so I know this is the funny thing

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,720
about it is it's just so obvious like of

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,990
course it should be doing that we've not

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,260
been doing this

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:07,230
so anyway it's great if the whole thing

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,940
resizes and so what's nice is the

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,730
headline and the type they're staying

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,860
and proportion to one another I've

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,160
experimented with this with this a

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:24,890
little bit as well this is on my code

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:29,730
pen and basically it just responds so

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:32,340
this is justified type which is

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,600
incredible to respond because the way

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,670
that should work is it should just be

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,930
reflowing and you get these huge gaps in

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,790
the paragraphs that's what you should

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:45,870
expect to see but you don't see that at

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:48,000
all so if the whole thing is responding

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,980
like this right if we've we've gotten to

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,070
this place finally where we're able to

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,890
control this medium that's so fluid it's

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,400
so hard to handle as a designer well why

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,500
not let's do it with images - that's a

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,900
background image and it's just

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,520
responding I'm not even like it's the

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,410
same size as the box so the background

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,410
size is just responding

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,940
so yeah I think we've spent a lot of

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,560
time talking about design it is probably

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,120
a little bit confusing but this is

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,190
basically all I have I'm really excited

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,930
about this I'm excited about using fluid

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,550
design and being able to just get things

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,190
to do what they should have sort of

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:34,530
already been doing in the first place so

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,530
yeah that's basically it

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:55,060
so yeah I'll take questions well it's

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,860
all my code pen and then I also I have a

00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,280
portfolio on behance still I think but

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,640
most of my stuff is in code now so yeah

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,510
thanks yeah

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,510
what

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,360
okay gotcha

00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:28,540
interesting okay so so his question was

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,860
how when I'm referencing break points

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,340
like what's the difference between that

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,410
and fluid design okay so the difference

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,590
is you have a lot of different devices

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,810
right and you can't really code for

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,520
every single device and when your font

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,280
size is something that's static it's

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,050
always 24 pixels it's gonna be 24 pixels

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,700
on something this big and it's just

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,140
gonna wrap right that text is just gonna

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,110
wrap around and you're gonna have this

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,390
giant font on this tiny device like it's

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,370
not going to change so what you do is

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,350
you go oh yeah so for tiny devices from

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,120
this break this point to this point I

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,420
want all of these to be roughly this

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,620
size

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,830
and that's kind of how we've walked

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,660
around it which sort of works sort of

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,540
works unless you have a slightly outside

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,010
of that looking font and or well it's

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,750
slightly outside of that device that's

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,670
going to not be at those breakpoints and

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:20,070
one of the biggest things that's kind of

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:23,560
hard to explain is that the actual

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:26,530
proportion between the heading and the

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,840
rest of it you want that to stay fluid

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,820
you want that to stay the same like when

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,800
when you're doing it you you put it at

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,840
that point size on purpose for a reason

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,250
it's very much a specified thing so yeah

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,750
maybe it'll change a little bit but if

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,430
it gets a lot smaller then it's harder

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,630
for you to see like is this what I'm

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,370
supposed to be looking at it's that what

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm supposed to be looking at and it's

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,810
not even just typography you can do the

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,420
entire thing like you can do the entire

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,550
module you can have it just move up and

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,720
down like the entire box can move and so

00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,180
when you're basing it off of something

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,240
that's relative it's way easier to get

00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:03,490
it to be fluid I think that maybe

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,650
answers it I don't know max woods like

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,910
using a max width yeah so that's an

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,350
interesting way to do it because like I

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:16,450
said before like we're just gonna go

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:18,820
back we should not be doing this we

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,760
should not be having line links that go

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,220
all the way on a website we should not

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,370
be doing that so max widths are great

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,290
but that is awful it's awful for reading

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,690
it's awful for people with glaucoma it's

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,879
awful

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,190
a lot of people it's just making it

00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,840
harder for them to get to your content

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,789
anyways yeah you can just do a max width

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:45,460
it can stop it can grow and stop at a

00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:45,460
certain place and continue its yeah yep

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,730
yeah yeah yeah she's great yeah it's

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,730
gorgeous

00:19:56,139 --> 00:20:09,919
yes no way really that's so cool yeah I

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:11,779
know I have to go check that out I'm I

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,570
love it so much I'm such a geek about it

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:19,519
like her stuff is just so beautiful yeah

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:26,899
yeah for sure we need really good web

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:29,000
typography we do call yeah yeah

00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,830
very smart it's a really good way to do

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,529
things yeah once we start being able to

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,090
utilize grid more widely I think it'll

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:39,220
help a lot of things a lot more things

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,220
can be more fluid with with that yeah

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:51,049
yes yeah yeah I'll tweet it out I do my

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,820
citations at the end so I'll just tweet

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,080
them out so you guys um yeah I'll put

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,080
that in there yeah yeah

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:20,800
yeah my question though is where is the

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:23,470
relationship definitely answer to higher

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,090
contrast not sure that it would be a

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,590
screen reader thing I think that really

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,360
falls on the front end of to make sure

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,170
that they've put things in the right

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,940
spots but yeah I know for sure we have I

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,980
think it's a DEA compliant you have to

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,610
make sure that it's 88 compliant so that

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,440
everything is in a great way like one of

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,110
the things I think that people don't

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,460
realize he said really good type

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,650
designers and really good type

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,890
boundaries spend a year working on a

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:53,620
typeface one year and so when you're

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,450
going to like the font or whatever what

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,100
have you someone has just put that

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,810
together and maybe they did a really

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,520
good job you never know but they might

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,460
not up so a lot of this stuff where

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,380
we're looking at like really bad

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,940
versions of this right where you get a

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,350
typeface and because we don't have

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,760
kerning we don't have the ability to

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,840
just get different letters and put them

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,450
together on the web I mean that would be

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,670
insane because we don't have that you

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,900
get typefaces that just look awful like

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,550
they'll just have too much space here

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,620
it's hard to read so I think some of

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,210
that's really related to accessibility

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,780
because you want to make it as readable

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:28,030
as possible yeah yeah for sure it's

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,130
always a balance between making it like

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,660
beautiful and making it accessible and I

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,760
think that when you hit that sweet spot

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,160
you have a really gorgeous website and a

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,800
lot of people do really great work but

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,800
yeah yeah

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:53,330
so I had thought about using percentages

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,950
like so I have looked at that before I'm

00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,650
a really a big fan of this method

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,500
because you can set the like the tiny

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,600
like the you can set 320 and set your

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,250
pixel size and you can set your largest

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,710
screen and set that pixel size and it

00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:18,470
basically makes a scale using calc and

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:20,180
it's so nice yeah yeah right I'm not

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,500
sure on that one either cuz I did look

00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,670
into it for like a half second and

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,710
that's just like I don't know I really

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,510
like the being able to set it exactly

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,870
and knowing what it'll actually be

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,820
because also my designers are coming in

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,380
and giving me pixel sizes so it's kind

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,510
of nice to just be able to use what

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,210
they've designed and have it set and

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:41,180
then set it so what we've been doing a

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,470
lot of is having calc on every header so

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,450
like every header might have a different

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,280
size at different screen sizes and then

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,680
on body so really we're setting it a few

00:23:46,280 --> 00:24:02,420
places but it's still going to have the

00:23:48,680 --> 00:24:04,910
same proportionate response yes yes I

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,560
think I think it definitely does and

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,910
there I just listened to a podcast about

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,710
that I forgot which one it was oh yeah

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,390
absolutely he was asking if there's a

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,790
disadvantage coming from print and

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,990
looking at web as if it's print I really

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,960
think that there is I think we've done a

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,480
lot of things like it took us a long

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,820
time to get to where web is now because

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,740
we looked at it as if it was print like

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,390
we we really and I stressed this all the

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,840
time to my designers that I work with

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm like you have to stop making it a

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,330
width that stays the same all the time

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,340
whatever element you're doing you have

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,940
to stop that stop making margins on

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,400
websites

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,810
nobody wants margins on websites you

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,490
know like you know like you take the

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,740
page you move it out and then it's just

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,860
big white bar down the page like what is

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,600
that no you know it's like we have in

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,610
print we have gutter that's the middle

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,330
part portion of the book like you don't

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,840
want a gutter on a website

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,830
come on like anyways but yeah so I think

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
that there there are things that have

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,130
been done that are like detrimental and

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,340
then there are things that are really

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,810
great like bringing ins into web I think

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,130
it's really smart and making it

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,420
something standardized because not all

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,490
languages have ends you know like that's

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,380
great but I did just listen to a podcast

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,940
about that and I don't quite remember

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:26,180
the one but if I firm I relish you go

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:26,180
yeah yep yes

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,820
yeah one of the things I like to tell

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,160
them a lot is think about it as multiple

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,220
grids right because if you're a designer

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,210
like 101 use a grid right like and there

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,860
are lots of grids there are lots of

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,300
beautiful grids that you can use and I

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,920
like to tell them like don't think about

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,420
it just being like 1/2 column half

00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,400
column like think about it being 4

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,990
columns so what if it's 5 columns you

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,420
know like it's the web you can literally

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:03,030
do five columns and have it just flow

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,560
like it's it can just have you know four

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,110
columns here and wherever else like it

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,730
can just scale and stack basically the

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,170
biggest thing is scaling stack I feel

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,820
because it's it's hard for them to

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,390
understand I think the designer who I

00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,800
work with who understands it the best is

00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,950
the one who worked at the Apple Store

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,110
first and would just watch every year

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,450
they slightly changed the device like a

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,250
few pixels or whatever and so he's like

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,200
yeah no I I can't really just design

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,580
something at a pixel size like it's

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,050
gonna be something else tomorrow you

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,280
know so and they're all these different

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,690
devices everywhere so I think he

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,900
understands it the best and trying to

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,450
think about it be like try to think

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,630
about it being a movable thing that can

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,830
just completely grow like instead of

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,390
thinking about it always staying where

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,860
it's at think about it growing and then

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,900
starting with mobile I think the biggest

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,880
thing is starting with like mobile sizes

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:55,490
so anything that's movable that you can
