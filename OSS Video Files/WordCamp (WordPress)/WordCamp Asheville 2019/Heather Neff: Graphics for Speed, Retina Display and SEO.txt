I'm going to introduce myself my name is

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,540
Heather Neff I own and operate a company

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,109
named Neff creative here in Asheville

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,660
I'm a graphic designer and a score space

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,740
web developer I've been in business for

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,510
19 years working on e-commerce so my

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,160
background is especially in user

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,720
experience design and user interface

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,189
design so we're going to start off with

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,239
the basics of graphics a lot of you guys

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,000
are gonna roll your eyes at this but

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,399
this is a kind of a graphic of how to

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,829
show vector versus pixels vector

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,660
graphics are usually designed in Adobe

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,090
Illustrator which is a mathematical

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,670
based program that will create lines and

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,230
shapes based on calculations that can be

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,969
scaled indefinitely and have no

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,170
resolution whereas pixels you guys are

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,410
probably all familiar with our

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,609
resolution based and are called raster

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,710
vector rest or graphics so jumping into

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,850
the image file types all of you are

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,640
going to be very familiar with what a

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,320
JPEG is they are universally accepted

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,830
across every platform just our gifts are

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,220
great for animation and very small

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,409
colored images that you're creating

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,759
TNG's are great for transparencies

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,540
they're actually pretty much the only

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,310
thing you can use when you have a

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,880
transparent background note that

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,170
transparent images and pngs can actually

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,329
be very large because there are lossless

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,540
images so when you export them they stay

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,060
very good in quality pds stands for a

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,710
portable document format which as you

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,229
guys know you can upload to the internet

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,310
and download and print as a graphic

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,960
designer one of the things a lot of

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,490
people don't know about PDFs is that

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,259
they can be an actual editable

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,790
illustrator file from adobe illustrator

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,020
so if you're working with a graphic

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,640
designer it's good to know that if you

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,290
get a PDF from them it's probably

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,350
containing editable vector graphics

00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:01,020
Tiff's are usually in the Cy 4k format

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,790
for prints they're the best quality for

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,210
when you're sending the images to print

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,380
that you want to use I

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,600
don't get into too much about the

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,660
differences between RGB and CMYK but

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,040
real quick RGB stands for green red

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,330
green blue which is the screen

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,580
resolution color schemes see my cans

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,319
CMYK stands for cyan yellow magenta and

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,480
black which are the the cartridges that

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,810
you'd get on a printer of any you know

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,480
at your home printer and that's how big

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,270
the images are converted for print is to

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,319
put into that that image load now

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,480
there's something that you guys probably

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,280
don't know about which is called WebP II

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,900
images which is new from Google they're

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,400
working on their own image format right

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,870
now the way that web PE images are

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,910
program is they actually take your JPEGs

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,850
and your PNG s and they convert them

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,550
into limpy images by compressing them by

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,900
about 30% for speed so Google is

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,610
actually working on their own system

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,590
right now and there is a wordpress

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,450
plugin that you can put into your sites

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,180
that will then convert all of your JPEGs

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,680
and pngs into web key images but you

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,239
have to know that web p images are not

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,739
supported by every browser of course

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,870
chrome but not everyone so then you have

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,040
to program and fallback images so keep

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,959
your own in that particular type of

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,450
format it's coming as they want to speed

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,030
up the web and of course scalable vector

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,780
graphics so I talked a lot about SVG's

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,730
as I'm kind of a fan of them as vector

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,950
graphics can be much much smaller and

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,989
file size and anything pixels pixels are

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,570
always photographs so you can't actually

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,220
make an SVG out of a photograph or

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,700
pixel-based image you have to have

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,730
vector artwork to create a true SVG

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,190
these can be perfect for logos or icons

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,590
within the website so as you're working

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,030
with web developers and one to worry

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,549
about site speed you definitely want to

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:52,820
consider changing anything that's a logo

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:57,200
or an icon into an SVG file so let me go

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,790
back real quick so SVG code can be

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,040
exported from illustrator and I want to

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,230
show you this this animation that's

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,079
happening is something that when you

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:10,760
export SVG's from illustrator you can

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,500
actually go ahead and animate it because

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,959
it's actually XML code as well and so

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,079
this is actually a Jif of

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,130
some SVG code being animated but it kind

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,829
of gives you the idea that there's

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,970
program called SVG a der comm that will

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,919
allow you to animate all your SVG files

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,210
so I want to explain retina graphics as

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,410
well because it's kind of tricky and

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,729
this has been something as a graphic

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,889
designer has it driven me a little nuts

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,440
over the last few years basically what

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,030
it means is that the web does not care

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,710
what resolution images are it cares how

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,440
big they are so when you're exporting an

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,590
image from Photoshop and you have a

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,210
standard size and it's 72 Reds and it's

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,949
programmed at a certain size it's going

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,509
to be what's considered low res if you

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,430
double that image and then program it to

00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,900
be 50% then you're restraining the

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,180
height and the width of it to be smaller

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,250
then it becomes higher resolutions if

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,900
you have an image that is then basically

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,630
in a 100% table that can flow back and

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,280
forth that can depend on what you know

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,720
what screen that's being looked at it

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,889
easy they're gonna be high resolution or

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,330
it's going to be lows or resolution

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,130
depending on which screen and that's

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:15,039
called a fluid resolution so working a

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,680
lot with facebook ads and Instagram ads

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,789
and Instagram and so forth people should

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,139
know that when you're uploading the

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,659
images into these social media platforms

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,720
the images are then highly compressed

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,550
and optimized by those programs also

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,380
when you're dealing with images you

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,720
really don't want to put text on top of

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,479
images when you put the text on top of

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,310
image they're first not search engine

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,990
friendly and they're not screenreader

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,490
reader friendly so anybody who's are

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,990
blind or deaf when they're using a

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,169
screen reader if you have text embedded

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,820
into an image that will not be a DA

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,800
compliant for that when you're also

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,699
dealing with images on a mobile device

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,280
you want to make sure that you're using

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,780
really clear and simple fonts that are

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,070
easy to read because a lot of times

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,470
people will take a graphic and they'll

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,210
put a bunch of the text on it and then

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,310
they don't realize that when they shrink

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,259
it down into the mobile device the text

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,139
becomes almost powerful impossible to

00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,849
read so I highly advise checking where

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,099
you're putting text on images and if you

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,180
can avoid it avoid it if you can't

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,070
because you're doing something like an

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,720
Instagram ad and make it really really

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,610
plain and simple and definitely

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,580
second on the mobile device before you

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,470
you know make sure it goes out into the

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,670
world so because this talk is about SEO

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,290
as well so we're gonna talk a little bit

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,120
about user experience design tomorrow

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm giving a talk on user experience

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,350
design as well and one of the things

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,960
that's really important is load time

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,550
because the number one thing that Google

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,990
is actually doing right now is indexing

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,940
your mobile site and how fast that

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,440
mobile site loads is partly the most

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,300
important factor and how you're being

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,540
categorized and ranked in Google these

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,840
days so load time affects everything

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,310
about that and Google will also notice

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,410
if your load time is too high we'll

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,450
start penalizing you and you'll start

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,220
stop coming up so high and this in the

00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,990
rankings you also want to make sure that

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,330
when you're doing basic SEO work that

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,860
you're doing keyword research you guys

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,810
should be familiar with doing some of

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,430
that if you don't basically use a Google

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,530
Keyword research tool there's plenty

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,120
about there tools out there to find what

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,720
your keywords are what you want to do is

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,430
take that list and create a document

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
that would have all of the top keywords

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,180
for your website so if you're a web

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,540
WordPress designer and you are trying to

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,340
rank for WordPress designer I use this

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,140
example as what you would want to name

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,790
your JPEGs but you also want to realize

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,229
that when you're designing a website

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,390
page that has a bunch of different

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,940
graphics in it and you just basically

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,070
keyword stuff with you know WordPress

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,440
designer JPEG for every single image

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,240
Google actually understands that what

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,590
you're trying to do is kind of SEO for

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,300
that one particular word and not

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,640
actually you're not probably serving up

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,130
the exact same image so what you want to

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,610
do is carefully select your keywords and

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:54,370
rename every single JPEG or PNG

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,050
differently but with SEO in mind so that

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,550
Google understands that you are taking

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,900
the time to SEO your JPEGs and your pngs

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,010
with the intention of making sure that

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,690
they are different images so that's the

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,240
next step is to take that same SEO

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,580
keywords when you want to da-da

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,020
compliant you have to give alt text to

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,460
all of your images this is a crucial

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,970
point here that Google is actually

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,900
starting to really worry about how ad a

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,630
compliant your site

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,430
and they'll give you a negative score a

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,110
positive score on if you're a t8

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,940
compliant with your images so every

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,370
single image in your website has to have

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,830
an alt tag an alt tag is in the back end

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,839
which you can hide and not display on

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,089
your website or it's something that you

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,950
can actually have as a caption

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,110
underneath the image and it has to be

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,789
coded correctly as the alt tag and in

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,490
the alt tag you have an opportunity to

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,470
then use those keywords again to you

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,050
know basically help your SEO but at the

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,460
same time he also want to make sure that

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,990
you're being ADA compliant which means

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,730
you're describing what actually is

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,680
inside that image so if it's a picture

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,300
of a dog but you want to su about

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,180
whatever your company is you have to

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,070
gently massage your SEO and the ad a

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,570
compliance e together so you want to

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,430
make sure that that's a really important

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,260
factor that you do for every single

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,510
image in your website there's actually

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,740
software out there for 88 compliancy

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,910
that you can run and we'll tell you if

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,860
you're missing your alt text because a

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,110
lot of us get busy we start designing

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,790
stuff and all of sudden we forgot the

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,560
old tag you know it's this little thing

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,820
or you go back and oh yeah I put that

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
image five years ago and it's called

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,700
untitled jpg and you're like oh I should

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,620
probably go back and change all these

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,880
things so put it on your to do is to go

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,620
check the image names of every single

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,570
graphic in your website check and see if

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,770
you have alt text and see if there SEO

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,630
because I can really help your site

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,140
improve a lot for both eighty-eight

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:41,650
compliancy for SEO so once you've

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,600
exported images through Photoshop you

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,050
can also run through compressor IO or

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,050
tiny

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,850
PNG com there's also a wordpress plugin

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,279
for compressing images that you can add

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,950
to your website and content management

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,300
some content manages systems when you

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,000
upload your image will then create

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,890
various sizes for images as well so I

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,690
work on Squarespace what they do is I

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,010
upload one image and they create seven

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,320
and they have programs that will then

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:10,000
deliver which one is appropriate for

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,100
which device at that time so the average

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,070
time it takes to load a mobile site is

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,690
22 seconds yet the 53% of visits are

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,670
abandoned if a mobile site takes longer

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,850
than three seconds to load and that's a

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,209
big problem so we're going to talk about

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,550
how to test your air speed this is a

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,760
list of URLs where you can basically

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,690
just go there and punch in your URL what

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,540
will happen is

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,670
sites will basically analyze your

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,160
website it will come back with house how

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,730
fast your site is it will give you a

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,140
whole list of things that are wrong with

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,240
it and how to fix it so they'll give you

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,130
a cascading thing about your JavaScript

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,300
and your images and how you can press

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,800
them and there's all kinds of tips and

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,660
helps to do this my favorite is the

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,000
j-team metrics com that seems to be the

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,010
most accurate I want you guys to know

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,750
that every single speedtest is different

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,730
and you can also change the location so

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,640
you can say I want to know how fast my

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,740
sites speed is from where I am from New

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,030
York City or Canada or France because

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,430
that load time is going to be different

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,050
you can also touch the top link for

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,510
think with Google is actually a mobile

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,240
site test just to let you know two

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,100
mobile sites with with Google always

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,630
tell you that you're crazy slow they

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,070
always it's a matter what site it is

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,660
they seem to always make you sound like

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,870
you're the worst developer ever and that

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,120
it's horrible so just take it out with a

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,270
grain of salt Google tends to make you

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,310
feel bad about your site speed and then

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,530
also one really important thing too is

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,520
because you're trying to you know speed

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,690
up your site because it's the most

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,370
crucial thing you can do for your

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,900
website right now is that you want to

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,000
benchmark your your test by taking

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,260
screenshots of any of these speed tests

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,490
that you happen to be doing so that when

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,390
you change something on the web you can

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,640
go back and see how you did so you can

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,810
also lazy load images you've probably

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,040
seen this before especially in

00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,770
e-commerce sites where there's a ton of

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,150
images that are being loaded when you go

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,920
to a web page and you see these gray

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,720
boxes that basically say like image

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,460
coming soon and as soon as you start

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,350
scrolling down the images flip over into

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,890
images and that's basically a way for

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,570
code code for you to code images that

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,430
are not needed yet so as a person

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,230
Scrolls down they are then loaded as

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,370
needed but if they don't scroll down

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,839
this page loads a lot faster so this is

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,810
just going to be really quick exporting

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,520
as from Photoshop CC if anyone wants

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,450
really good detailed information you can

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,860
come see me and talk to me about

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,320
graphics because I love talked about

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,900
Photoshop 11 doing it since basically

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,089
1999 but the safe as it has a function

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,310
at the on the top the left you can see a

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,740
little teeny tiny plus button and you

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,540
can add 2 X 3 X images

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,000
as you're exporting right it's straight

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,860
from from Photoshop one of the key

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
things you want to do to make a smaller

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,270
file size is actually crop it and make

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,070
it pretty much the size that you know it

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,140
wants to be but eliminate extra

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,089
information off an image if you can

00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,620
because I can actually literally cut off

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,279
all the pixels you're not exporting it

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,110
helps you save kilobytes at the top

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,130
right side you can see where the quality

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,750
is for an image

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,070
note that the preview is actually

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,060
showing the image of how it looks you

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,440
have a really good idea of how the

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,270
quality's actually gonna look so you can

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,920
determine if it needs to be at a hundred

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,240
percent because you just really need to

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,130
look its best or if you can drop the

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,790
quality down for speed I highly

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,620
recommend working on trying different

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,540
image sizes for what you need and then

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,800
playing with the quality to get what you

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,470
know you want but you actually don't

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,970
need too much of quality thirty to forty

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,650
percent actually works quite well for a

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,029
lot of things at different things you

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,110
can also just scale an image in

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,960
Photoshop and that will do the same

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,310
thing or it can actually type in the

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,260
width and Heights and it will be

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,850
automatically connected now note this

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,790
original image that I'm working with was

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,620
a high-res image if you just do say that

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,240
in Photoshop and you're in the screen

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,209
the original image is not actually

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,770
changed in size or manipulated in any

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,010
way you're doing all of this in the

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,270
exportation of a new graphic also

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,100
there's a choice here on the bottom

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,500
right to include the copyright and

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,410
contact information which I highly

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,720
suggest you this check that off and also

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,270
I highly suggest converting it to srgb

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,290
which is now the universal screen format

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,000
for color to make it most accurate this

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,920
is exporting an SVG code from

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,680
Illustrator and as you're walking

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,020
through the the last screen and it pops

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,220
up to save the graphic you can see here

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,950
at the bottom there's an actual little

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,320
button that says SVG code if you click

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:32,290
on that it pops up in a text box which

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,050
has some XML code this XML code also has

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,510
CSS in it and as you take this code and

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,860
you can put a code block into your enter

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,560
your website it will actually display

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,430
the graphic so this is actually a logo

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,779
being displayed on the right here now

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,900
kind of just note that when you do the

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,059
SVG's it's not good for something as

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,099
complicated as an imp

00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,359
graphic so if you have designed when you

00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:55,709
work with a graphic designer and they're

00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,639
in illustrator and they design something

00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,279
that has a bunch of different elements

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,629
like an infographic you try to export

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,879
and you're like I'm going to do SVG

00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:04,169
codes they're so super cool and you take

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,449
this SVG code and you put it in the

00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:09,509
website it could actually be ten times

00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:11,279
higher and file size than a PNG because

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,859
of the fact that this XML code is

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,679
actually trying to render the SVG and

00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:18,569
tell the browser what it looks like so

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,719
you really want to keep your SVG codes

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:23,699
to really basic simple logos or icons

00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:25,289
and that's the only thing I would kind

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,819
of tell you to do if you did want to try

00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,049
this code stuff out it is pretty cool

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:30,029
what do you see that you're not actually

00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,679
using an image file you're using code to

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,629
display a logo at first I was like

00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,299
that's some miracle it's magic I don't

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,739
know how that happens but as a graphics

00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,809
person it was kind of cool but I also

00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:42,179
noticed that when I put two or three of

00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:44,669
these little XML codes into the website

00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,169
all of a sudden the CSS started clashing

00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:47,789
and they started looking bad and I was

00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,379
like what is going on here so you have

00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:51,839
to go back in and start giving them

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,939
individual ID tags and then they're just

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,949
finicky so be careful in this here I

00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,959
don't actually recommend if you're you

00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:59,909
know gonna do something quick to throw

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,739
these on the internet play with them see

00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:03,479
what you think I'm really looking

00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:05,189
forward to the SVG talk here later today

00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:07,529
in this room to find out more about what

00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:11,939
he has to say but one of the things you

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:15,139
can do is simple logos and icons in SVG

00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:21,919
code which is kind of really cool and

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:21,919
that's my time so at 1:45

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:32,670
a lightning talk it is I know I was

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,959
gonna say can I take five minutes of

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,430
questions or not I don't know because

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,790
lightning talks you're really lightning

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,790
so

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,760
yeah I'm actually a huge family export

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,649
for a web legacy because it just I'm a

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,630
huge fan of the export for web legacy I

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,730
used to use it all the time but when I

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,709
discovered that you can not actually

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,390
have to go to image a massage first and

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,790
then do export for web because you can't

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:03,149
change the image size in the export for

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,980
legacy check this the the export ads out

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,660
because you can actually not even resize

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,579
your you haven't skipped that step of

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,630
resizing your images completely and it

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,939
doesn't actually affect the original

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,860
image so they advanced it quite some up

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,579
any yes yes and actually one of the

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,280
screen-used

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,670
yeah so there's also I think back to

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,870
that screen but the on the top left here

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,579
you can see where I've got it down to

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,870
under 50 kilobytes here that shows you

00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,890
where the kilobytes are and that's a

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,890
really important thing to achieve

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,190
yeah so this is in Photoshop CC this is

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,510
the export as the screen and again you

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,800
want to keep working on your kilobytes

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,290
the number one thing that will kill your

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,970
site speed is image sizes so make sure

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,190
that you get them as close as you can to

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,840
50 kilobytes and under and SVG files by

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,980
the way can be as low as 5 kilobytes

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,980
they're actually tiny tiny

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,049
that's a very good question a lot of

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,789
people come to me and ask that kind of

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,140
question like I use canva how do I do

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,690
that I thought I don't know I use

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,399
Photoshop CC because I'm a professional

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,630
designer I don't know how to do that so

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,039
there is I know that there's a lot of

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,600
screen resolutions where I'm sure if you

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,340
upload it if you're not worried about it

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,690
you can look up little stuff into

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,460
Facebook and now we'll optimize some

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,630
stuff but it used to be that you had a

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,100
low-res screen that you could just

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,960
screenshot something and it would be

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,669
kind of a low res version of it then I

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,380
got this Retina screen and I started

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,880
screen shot things and I was like cut

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,289
screen shots three megabytes like how

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:41,639
did that happen so you have to be really

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:45,029
careful about that Photoshop to infinity

00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:46,440
you know anything about because I was

00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,330
thinking about buying it so like 40

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,130
bucks and this must be comfortable that

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,500
Photoshop do you know it has a lot of

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:56,250
these features I don't I haven't

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,049
actually instance it does if you think

00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,880
about a fit affinity designer there's a

00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,409
finicky photo that kind of replaces to

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,059
other stuff they need a designer which

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,970
is kind of like fireworks used to be

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:09,950
which does some raster and some vector

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:16,110
together and yeah if you want to dump

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:18,240
Adobe yeah when I was yet it does

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:24,570
everything and it opens also to shop

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:26,070
class and say this Photoshop yeah I've

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,990
never tried it before because I just

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,120
couldn't with Photoshop for 20 years but

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,250
I do know that you can you get Photoshop

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,100
now just as a single program for $9.99 a

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,480
month so that's a nice alternative they

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,980
don't have to they used to make it the

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,830
package that you had to get it from I

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,539
believe $20 20 99 or something now it's

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,549
only $9.99 a month so they're really

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,860
making a friendly enough that people can

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,779
at least export your images for web and

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,070
really control that kilobytes I can't

00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,360
emphasize that enough that's probably

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,210
the number one thing that people don't

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,620
do is export their images in a proper

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,620
way to get the kilobytes down yes

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,580
[Music]

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,320
yeah so the scale function actually he

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,629
just leaved like the normal image Sona

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,519
you open the high-res images like 6000

00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:13,889
pixels wide if you hit the scale you can

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,479
basically use that as a way to drop it

00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:18,299
to ten percent of what it was and

00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,679
automatically bring it down so it will

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:26,129
change all the settings if you try to

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:28,950
take a sense scale and kiss the canvas

00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:33,269
size and image size are the same it's

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,590
kind of like they're kind of linked it's

00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,649
kind of hard to explain the canvas size

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,940
is actually older yeah Photoshop treats

00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:42,409
them in a different way but the same

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,409
