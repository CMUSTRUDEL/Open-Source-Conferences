	00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:14,849
it was a dinnertime and the family had

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,710
already finished dinner we were having a

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:22,289
little bit of dessert and the phone rang

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,740
it was the office for my dad now the

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,439
number of times that the office called

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,420
my dad in the evening at our house was

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,000
exactly zero up until that point in time

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,380
so it was just not normal right he

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,780
picked up the phone he listened for a

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,149
few minutes hung up and said I gotta go

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,860
and again the number of times my dad

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,070
left our house to go back to work after

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,719
dinner never before so it was a very

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,750
strange evening one that I'll remember

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,449
for years on end and he took off and we

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,699
didn't see him for a couple days he

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,410
drove to work work was only about 45

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,079
minutes away but he stayed at a hotel

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,910
right next to the office and just kept

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,530
sitting at the office working for

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:07,110
several days and what happens I can now

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,720
tell you only because he doesn't work

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,310
there anymore and because hopefully none

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,860
of them or the government is gonna watch

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:19,200
this video we'll see so it turns out

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,330
right that they he worked for a

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,479
satellite company they shoot low Earth

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,070
orbiting or Leo satellites just outside

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
of our atmosphere they're the kind of

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,770
satellites you use for satellite TV or

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
for satellite phones all that kind of

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,579
technology stuff so you shoot a

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,490
satellite up you shoot out several they

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,430
create this space where they can reflect

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,130
back and that's how you get cable and

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,100
phone and other service and so the

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,110
company that they did the work for was a

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,280
telecommunications company that was very

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,689
excited to launch you service in Brazil

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,759
or actually let's just say a country

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,390
like Brazil could be any country right

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,530
we don't need to get into details but

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,329
they do think like when you're gonna

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,280
launch new service in a place like

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,099
Brazil what do you do you buy billboards

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,020
and you establish retail shops and you

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,700
staff it you train people and you have

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,560
guys with weird signs who are shaking

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,080
the signs right outside the door come in

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,870
by you know cell service and they were

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,950
doing all that in the months before they

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:27,959
got ready to launch service and the day

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,390
of the launch there was no service none

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,920
now at the same exact time in another

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,459
country that sounds remarkably like

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,870
Mexico an executive right an executive

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,290
for the telecommunications company had

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:45,840
the Sat phone with him and his phone

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:48,330
beeped on and he was like punches the

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,510
call you know to the home office and

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,160
says hey when did we get service in

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,250
Mexico and they said we don't have

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,170
service in Mexico and he said well I'm

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:04,110
calling you on my Sat phone right now

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:05,459
and they were so curious how did it so

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,750
they had he was on vacation with his

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,370
family but he got in the car rental car

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,099
they started driving all around Mexico

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,530
and he was like ya know I keep can you

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,489
hear me now right like we got signal

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,140
everywhere so in a mad rush they bought

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,370
billboards in Mexico they set up retail

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,370
shops in Mexico they hired guys the

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,380
signs in Mexico now if you've never

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,769
built a satellite I just want to be a

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:35,069
tip okay turns out if you take those

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:38,130
super big panels and mix up left and

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,709
right it turns out you might give total

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:44,489
coverage to Mexico instead of Brazil

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,469
all right and that's what dad works my

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,150
dad was actually helping the engineering

00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,230
team to build the satellite I don't want

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,849
to say it's all his fault

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,930
right but Mexico loves him I think they

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:56,250
wrote a song about him and and again

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,540
we're not really allowed to talk about

00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,549
this right

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,280
but this morning what I want to do is

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,980
spend a little bit of time talking to

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,170
you about some of the big mistakes I've

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,629
made in life that I remember now

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,849
satellite one not my mistake right but

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:14,099
there are a few that are mine so can I

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,450
tell you some of those stories awesome

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,949
by the way if you're still standing

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,509
there are some seats back over there

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,769
that you can just come on if you want to

00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,300
relax because I'm gonna be a little bit

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,400
I mean I've made a lot of mistakes right

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:30,360
all right so there's a time that I hired

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,229
mr. green all right mr. green was

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,550
awesome in the old days and and many of

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,860
you are too young to know this but

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,800
before Google there was another big

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,280
technology company called Microsoft and

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,440
and everybody who was anybody who is

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,699
serious about computing right especially

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,740
if you weren't living in the bay area of

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,530
California where I was at the time they

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,300
were working for Microsoft and if you

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,310
could hire or steal someone from

00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,330
Microsoft and get them to join your

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,400
startup that was a big deal and I was an

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,169
executive running one of over the course

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,960
of about ten years I started and sold

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,699
four or five software companies and in

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,419
that time one of our startups

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:17,699
I recruited a former tech evangelist

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,550
from Microsoft that was a huge deal I

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,949
mean I I told our president CEO I said

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,090
look if I get this guy I'm retiring like

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,009
that's the best thing I've ever done

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,620
this is so difficult you don't

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,349
understand I'm getting him to leave the

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,400
big company with the stock options and

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,690
the money and everything else that I'm

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,020
getting him to join a San Francisco

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,060
starting and so mr. green came in and we

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,250
chatted we hung out interviewed him

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,180
checked on a couple references had him

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,520
talked to some of the rest of my

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,530
engineers and we hired if you know

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,690
anything about a Technical Evangelist

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,500
job a Technical Evangelist is someone

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,810
who is deeply technical but also can

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,240
talk to people

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,340
and they could talk to other developers

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
and invite them to check out the

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,070
technology that Microsoft was building

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,100
so it's a huge win and on the first day

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,040
I gave him an assignment and the wheels

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,830
started falling off something wasn't

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,990
right second day gave him a different

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,060
assignment one that was super remedial

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,960
like super easy let's just let's go for

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,550
a couple quick wins and when I asked to

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,870
look at hey let me take a look at the

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,490
stuff that you wrote

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,700
he was like yeah that's not optimized

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,260
yet let me show it to you tomorrow and

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,290
then the next day he didn't show

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,510
and then he wrote us a note saying sorry

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,680
my wife's in the hospital and we were

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,960
like oh my goodness so I said well I I

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,220
asked my admin can you send flowers to

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,650
the hospital for her mrs. green likely

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,470
at this hospital and she comes back says

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,729
there's no mrs. green at the hospital I

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,110
said ok we'll try the other hospitals I

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,400
mean call couple hospitals I mean maybe

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,690
they went to maybe they look further I

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,380
mean here's the address that he lives at

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:03,050
and no no mrs. green so I sent him a

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,160
note saying hey super sorry about your

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,260
wife we try to send flowers do you want

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,810
to send it to your house instead and he

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,280
said I know what you're doing when

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,570
someone tells you I know what you're

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,550
doing when you aren't really doing

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,930
anything you should totally be like

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,630
what's going on here right

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:25,310
some-something sounds fishy so my boss

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,680
president/ceo says how deep did you do

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,050
your background search on him and how am

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,200
I not deep enough so let's start calling

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,570
people so he went to University of

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,580
California at San Diego and I contacted

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,260
them and I said I need mr. green from

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,200
the computer science department roughly

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,789
this years and they're like no no mr.

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,680
green and then I was like ok well

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:53,690
broaden the years maybe I'm missing on

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,610
his age no ok we'll go outside of

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,490
computer science right anyone we've

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,120
never had a mr. green here and you're

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,680
like ok ok that's strange so then we

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,080
start looking up more data and we're

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,999
just trying to ask him I sent him a note

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,289
like hey

00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,459
I need your transcript when you come in

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,099
because I didn't put that into the file

00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,809
and his email response had a whole bunch

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,589
of four-letter words none of which were

00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:21,159
the kind of words I'd show to my mom and

00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:26,369
we said okay you're done right three

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:30,639
days so what's the lesson higher slowly

00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:32,709
higher slowly fired quickly it turns out

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,289
over the course of years I've had two or

00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:38,949
three of these situations where I have

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,990
been so excited so rushed to get the

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:42,310
perfect person that I was doing most of

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,050
the mental gymnastics in my head

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,389
about what they were going to be rather

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,129
than actually who they were turns out he

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,129
was a Technical Evangelist for Microsoft

00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,350
Microsoft in those days did not actually

00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,939
give you references but they had just

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,399
the previous year spun up something

00:08:54,939 --> 00:09:00,040
where you could pay a small amount and

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,529
get the basic data name start date end

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,819
date his resume had said he'd spent 16

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:09,009
years at Microsoft turns out he spent

00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:11,019
six months and myself right so the only

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,430
good news is it took me a lot less than

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:17,470
it took Microsoft and figure out the guy

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,790
was total fraud right but go slowly when

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,350
you're hiring people right now the

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,209
WordPress community is awesome it's

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,189
amazing there's incredible people but it

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,480
still doesn't mean someone can't because

00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,860
we're so good willed and we're so

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,170
excited to connect with other people in

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,300
committee it doesn't mean someone can't

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,480
come in and suggest they're someone

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:38,829
they're not right so hire slowly fire

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,750
quickly fast all right

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:45,059
then there was a time I was sitting in a

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:47,670
cafe and talking to a prospect right and

00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,410
you know how there's those projects that

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,000
they stretch you they feel like they're

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,980
just bigger than something you've done

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,420
before and you're like yeah I think I

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,350
can pull this together well you don't

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,790
realize is that maybe the reason that

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,050
it's been too far out there for you

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,480
right is because you don't fully know

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,100
all of what's included and so in this

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,899
particular scenario I was quoting a

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,379
project but I didn't know all the

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:14,319
details right and yet that didn't matter

00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:16,300
right so I was like okay we got this so

00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:18,309
I'm talking I'm talking he's talking

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,329
we're going back and forth and he says

00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,820
finally all right give me your number

00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,940
like

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,830
what's it gonna cost to build this if

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,900
you've ever been in that place where

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,870
you're like okay I normally charge a

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,420
thousand dollars and now I'm going to go

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,070
for five or you normally charge five

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,020
thousand dollars and now you're gonna go

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,100
for twenty or maybe you charge a hundred

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,250
dollars and then I'm gonna go for a

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,480
thousand it doesn't matter but if you 5x

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:49,900
or 10x or 20x to the number and you're

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:54,200
super excited you put the number out and

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,190
it's almost like you go right afterward

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,840
right but you're trying to hold that in

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,880
that's the inside face because you're

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,620
like are they gonna say okay I put out

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,960
my number and he was like sure done no

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:13,310
problem I was like that didn't go like I

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:18,440
thought I would that went so much faster

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,740
than I would I wonder is there a chance

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,270
that I am the one that's messing up here

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,520
right I mean we want to think you know

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,570
what I'm just a keen negotiator but when

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,760
you're like here's the number he's like

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,960
great oh my god he's almost laughing and

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,270
smiling while he's signing and you're

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:39,320
like I think something's wrong I just

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:41,510
don't know what it is right so I worked

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,950
on the project right we did the project

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,540
of course halfway through the project

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,360
discovered a whole bunch of details that

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,420
I didn't know and suffice to say I

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:56,360
wouldn't really say I had profit on that

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:59,570
project right and it took a long time to

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,790
figure out you know there's more going

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,770
on here than I'm including into so I

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,820
went back to that guy right we're two

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,740
thirds away through the project and I

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,840
just said hey tell me when I gave you

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,940
that initial quote here's I'll tell you

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,090
I'll tell you right now man every quote

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:19,040
I gotten before yours was three times

00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:22,550
the price I'm like oh man he was yeah so

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,380
I figured even if you screw this up I

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,920
can still go higher once someone else

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,920
and be okay

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:34,070
Wow alright I believe that so the more

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,540
of the story right is that I develop

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,450
this phrasing I don't know how many of

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,670
you like barbecue I mean we're in one I

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,330
mean like we're in the home of barbecue

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,680
right

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,080
like you guys barbecue all the time you

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,520
love barbecue so here's what you don't

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,779
do if you want to marinade food right if

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,990
you're marinating chicken marinating

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,550
steak

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,720
here's what you don't do I come from

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,310
California so we do this all the time

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,630
someone comes over it brings over

00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,830
chicken and they're like oh you didn't

00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,779
marinate you're like no prom you open up

00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,190
a ziploc bag you throw the chicken in

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,540
then you throw a bunch of softened zip

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,250
it throw it in the fridge wait about an

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:09,190
hour come back out throw it on the grill

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:12,230
and you're ready to go right no no never

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:17,300
because that won't have done anything to

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:20,900
the chicken right in California there's

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,380
many things we do barbecuing isn't

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:29,470
really one of them we grill there's a

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:31,550
difference right marinating takes time

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,380
marinating is about putting the stuff in

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,050
the day before and letting it wait right

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,709
marinating is letting time do its work

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,900
and when you work with clients one of

00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:46,400
the things we have to do is when they

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:48,529
start talking not prepare to respond not

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,750
prepare what we're gonna say you know

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,279
any of you do that right where someone's

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,600
talking you're like oh yeah I know how

00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,950
to do that it'd be a post type and then

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,570
I could use this plug in I can do this

00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,279
theme and you're thinking of the

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:03,290
solution space almost immediately

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:06,470
instead of marinating in the problem

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,120
space just sitting and listening if I'd

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,740
done that with that customer and asked

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,750
more questions and dug in more one of my

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,279
favorite questions now is just tell me

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,360
how you've already tried to solve this

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,440
and they start explaining and even as

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,330
they're explaining they're telling me

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,440
nuances of the problem that I'd never

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:27,670
heard of before right marinate in the

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,370
problem space you won't lose your shirt

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,550
all right I worked as I mentioned before

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,459
five different startups we built them up

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,470
four out of the five we sold off a lot

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,320
of

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,300
young energy to hit certain milestones

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,220
and one of the big milestones for me was

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,150
selling my first company by the time I

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,880
was thirty right I that was a goal I had

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,010
sold a company when I was 27 but I was

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,050
not an owner of that business I had been

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,150
a hire an employee of that company and

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,330
we had started it up built it up sold it

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,520
off and I remember thinking okay I want

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,310
to sell my own right where I get the

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,650
benefit of it and so we built up a team

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,730
we started a software company we started

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,500
doing everything we had to do to build

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,110
it up and get it successful we got it

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,090
successful we had customers we had

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,020
revenue and then we went to selling and

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:24,570
I sold it two months before my 30th

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:28,480
birthday I did everything I wanted to do

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:31,120
mind you during that time I never saw

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,940
any friends didn't see a movie for two

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,820
years right barely slept I slept on

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,060
average four hours a night six days a

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:44,550
week I mean I made every sacrifice I

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:48,250
could to sell this company and we did

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,020
and on the day we sold the day we did

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,450
papers everything else I don't know what

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,970
I imagined but there was no confetti

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,010
from the sky there was no parade there's

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,120
no cameraman going hey you just sold the

00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,530
company about time you're 30 what are

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,520
you gonna do now and I'd say I'm going

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:07,150
to Disneyland none of that happened at

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,120
all I just got up the next day and it

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,670
was another normal day and the only

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,430
friends I had at that time were the

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,260
other guys in our company that also had

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,970
given up everything to do this you know

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,830
to get on this mission and it took I'm

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,860
super glad I had this experience at 30

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:31,270
right and not at 45 or 55 like I'm glad

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,710
it happened early to realize there

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,410
wasn't anything special about it in fact

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,089
my part my stake in that right if we're

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:42,580
gonna brag a little about how much money

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:43,720
I made I had millions but none of it was

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,750
cash

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,910
it was all tied in to the equity and

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,740
value of the next company I also had a

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,820
three year lockout which means you can't

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,380
do anything with the money

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,090
for three years and in the course that

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,190
three years I was invited as part of

00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,050
that next executive team to raise more

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,020
money and as I raised more money my

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,460
valuation kept shrinking my three and a

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,380
half million became thirty thousand

00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,100
dollars I gave up two years of my life

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,240
for thirty thousand bucks I'm not

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:15,689
probably sure to start with this one but

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:19,290
I didn't wanted to press you all okay

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,610
not every investment pays off the same

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm really glad to have learned this

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,569
lesson at thirty I don't know how many

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,220
of you are like I'm starting a new

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,540
company or I'm starting a new plug-in or

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,820
I'm starting a new theme or I'm starting

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,680
a new anything but it's easy to get

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,020
super excited about the thing that

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,940
you're doing and you focus in on it and

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,180
that's the only thing you focus in on to

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,950
the detriment of everything else only to

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,460
wake up and discover that the payoff

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,830
whatever you thought it was gonna be

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,910
wasn't really there

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,440
I'm glad I learned that at thirty

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,140
because the rest of my life changed

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,780
dramatically I today I work at a company

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,150
called liquid web and it's a great job

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,750
but I had offers from all the big names

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:04,570
you've heard of but in almost every case

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,170
those offers came with having to move

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,700
and my wife didn't love the idea like

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,620
she would start crying the moment you

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,650
start mentioning a city name and I chose

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,510
my life and I chose my kids over career

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,210
I haven't I have a fine career you know

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,460
it's nothing wrong with it

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:30,210
but at 30 I realized I need to optimize

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,650
for other things and not just the job I

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,690
know most of you are smarter than me but

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,710
there's a chance that one of you right

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,540
is focusing everything every minute of

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,410
every day of every hour you have friends

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,670
who worry about you and so even if

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,020
you're not here and your friend is here

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,720
right I'm telling them to go back and

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,880
tell you

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,530
right there is more than just work not

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,700
every investment pays the same dividend

00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:01,770
so choose wisely that makes sense

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,700
okay then there was the time that I

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,240
stayed at the job way longer than I

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,270
should have

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,300
and I knew it you know how you have let

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,110
me let me ask you two different way how

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:19,050
many men in the room have dated a woman

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:25,110
that they knew early on was not right

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:26,910
for them no don't show your hands the

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:30,420
same for women right how many women you

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,470
know they're the wrong guy or women with

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,180
the wrong women or guy with the wrong

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,520
guy it doesn't matter you know that

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,860
you're the person that you're hanging

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,710
with right now is not the right one and

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,030
yet you stay and I don't mean the wrong

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,530
one isn't like they're beating you I'm

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,470
not trying to get into something really

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:50,580
dark I'm just saying you're like yeah

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,260
they're okay like for now I have a 13

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,480
year old daughter my 13 year old

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,610
daughter is actually in high school she

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,870
just finished her freshman year and so

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,350
she in freshman year she wanted a

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,610
boyfriend right and and her mother and I

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,380
decided it was okay to have a boyfriend

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,790
we rather her date in the context of us

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,270
still being there than when she goes off

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,460
to college

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,170
that's our personal choice that may make

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,980
a talk later and mistakes I've made in

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:17,460
life but not in this one so so I we said

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,690
okay right and then casually right on

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,160
spring break we're talking and I said

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,810
well when you're when you break up and

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,220
you go through and she's like you don't

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:30,010
think me and my boyfriend are gonna last

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,030
you don't you don't have faith in my

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:38,110
relationship and I said oh I have 100%

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,380
100% faith that you will break up like

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,640
that in the history of all relationships

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,900
nobody at 13 and their freshman year

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
high school has ever said I found my

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,460
soulmate and she's like but I think I

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,450
have Mike stop talking

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,040
just stop talking because I'm gonna

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,200
start shooting video and this is gonna

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,790
be hilarious when you get married and

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,919
it's on the screen and I'm like look at

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:01,960
13 she thought she found her guy I was

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,960
in a job like that I was in a job where

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,380
I knew oh yeah it's not something you

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,540
know most amazing job that's okay

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:15,040
and what I was really doing was just

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:18,730
hiding I was just hiding I wasn't ready

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,169
to step out and take a risk for all the

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,110
years that I dub startups and I had a

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:24,250
high risk tolerance now is married and I

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,929
had kids and suddenly your risk

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,820
tolerance shrinks and you're thinking

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,470
about a house payment or a car payment

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,850
and for whatever reason I just started

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,559
getting anxious and nervous

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,179
that little imposter syndrome voice

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,230
going now you know what you don't know

00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,120
as much as you think you know and

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,080
there's no one that wants to hire you

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,299
and so I sat in a job way too long

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,770
the moment I took another job and like

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,880
ten people going I didn't realize you

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,020
were gonna take it it was just like why

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,360
don't you talk to me I would hired you

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,650
and you're like wow i okay next time I'm

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,650
just gonna raise my hand say I think I'm

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:58,809
leaving right and just see what offers

00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:01,390
him in but I was nervous right here's

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,950
the thing you've been to the grocery

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,900
store you've found food that says best

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,100
used by we tend to think of that as a

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,350
food thing because the food will

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,520
eventually go bad you will eventually go

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,340
back your skill set in a specific area

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,220
is going to dry up it's going to become

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,600
useless it doesn't matter what part of

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,910
technology you do doesn't matter whether

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
you're you know graphic design or

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,600
software development whether you're

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,830
building websites or mobile apps at some

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,570
point someone's going to build

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,669
technology that automates the stuff that

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,160
you spend a lot of time doing and when

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:36,190
that happens you're gonna realize oh

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,130
crap all this investment in the how is

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,690
not all that helpful

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,280
investment in the Y is always gonna be

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,170
helpful being able to explain to a

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,190
customer why we do what we do when we do

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:52,340
it fantastic but the how keeps changing

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,750
and if you're still doing the same stuff

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,370
you were doing last year or the stuff

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,230
you were doing the year before that if

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,630
you're just on autopilot doing the same

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,570
stuff over and over you've likely

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,980
reached yourself my date and the

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,270
important thing is to just realize it

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,520
and say okay it's time to learn some new

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,970
things it's time to put myself back into

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,770
a seat where I'm learning most you've

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,170
already doing that right because you had

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,100
an option this morning to go I don't

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,620
know if you saw there's some crazy

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,540
people that are running this morning

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,790
right as you can tell from my physique I

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,640
don't do that I stay far away from all

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,110
those running exercises but you decided

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,200
on a Saturday morning to come to a

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,730
technology conference and hang out

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,290
you've already taken the first step

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,820
towards getting yourself into a position

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,120
where you say I want to learn something

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,530
new for the rest of today and tomorrow

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,970
right if you feel like you're someone

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,790
who's reached their sell-by date your

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,010
job is to go grab as much new stuff and

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,350
just jam it in it doesn't mean that

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,700
you're gonna know it all by the end the

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,790
weekend but you will have had some

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,400
exposure and the exposure will help you

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,220
learn it later so instead of going to

00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,230
that session that you already know go to

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,880
the one you don't know instead of

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,680
talking to the friends the four or five

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,960
10 people that you know talk to people

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:11,180
you don't know

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:15,930
right and learn something new there was

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:18,340
that time we've all had it

00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,570
you write a blog you have a blog you

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,950
have a website people start writing

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,590
comments the first comments are like

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,570
awesome good job right then you get that

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,400
I disagree with you and how should I

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,810
write back and then you start getting

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:34,530
the comments that are just mean

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:41,100
but you think well I don't want to be

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:45,220
censoring the free speech on my website

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm a generous guy any of you come to my

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,690
house

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,950
you're welcome in any of you just show

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,660
up ring the doorbell

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,920
my wife will go answer the door or I'll

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,630
answer the door and you're like hey I

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,230
was at WordCamp Asheville your husband

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:02,710
said I could come in alright we'll let

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:05,380
you in right just a smallest sign and

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,210
and even if you don't have a church

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,890
background it's totally fun you will

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,560
catch this illustration to understand

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,300
how crazy I am at one point I was

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,400
preaching at a church and as an

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,800
illustration I had taken my house key

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,290
and I had gone to five hardware stores

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,960
and I'd made hundreds of copies of my

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,210
house key and that Sunday morning right

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,040
I had put a key every third seat

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,840
throughout the whole can I I invited the

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,220
audience to take the the congregation to

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,240
take the key and put on their tea ring

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,340
and they didn't know what it was for and

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,450
later I explained as part of the

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,600
Australian that it was key to my house

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,600
my wife was gonna kill me

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:45,160
SiC are you serious and I'm like it's an

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,780
illustration of these feeling they're

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,550
coming if they come it's fine right so

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,900
if you come right just come and just

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,900
ring the doorbell right we'll let you in

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,480
if you walk into my house you can walk

00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,770
straight to my fridge open it up take

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
anything in it I give you permission

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,380
right now you can totally do that I

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,420
won't have a problem what's mine is

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,100
yours if you want to have a soda you

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,840
want to have a water if you want to grab

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,460
some leftovers and sit down the table to

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:19,000
eat no problem here's what you can't do

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,040
you can't bring a spray-paint can into

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,320
my house and with spray paint write

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:31,840
something on the walls about my wife no

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:35,140
one will ever see you again you can't do

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,870
that my house my walls you don't get to

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,600
paint stuff about my wife on my walls

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:44,410
you can come into my house you can eat

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:49,930
my food and it turns out there's a

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:52,930
little button in my website that says

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,580
delete and when someone starts

00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:59,080
spray-painting on the inside of my walls

00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:01,590
of my blog I just hit delete and it

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,030
turns out it's also helpful in life

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,560
there's people that are - I don't know

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,530
maybe you know them from high school or

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,360
something maybe they're in the same

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,430
Meetup maybe they go to a work camp and

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,870
who knows how you meet them but you meet

00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,600
them and you feel some level of

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:20,470
obligation to be nice and there is a

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,570
fine I give you permission out to just

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:25,390
say hey thanks for sharing and then draw

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,770
a line and move on in life you do not

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,500
have to carry everyone that you've ever

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:34,750
known for life right okay learn to use a

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,640
delete button it will save you a lot of

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,660
heartache for years I had different

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,430
people writing on the blog that was if

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,110
you don't know I used to write a blog at

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,700
Chris summer comm where I wrote about

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:47,320
WordPress every single day for three

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,000
years every single day and the and the

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,179
comments would come in and most of them

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,889
would be fine but you get

00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:53,059
and 20% that were horrible and then over

00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,769
the years it got worse and I just

00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,999
started deleting more and more the new

00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:56,690
launched which is coming up with

00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:00,049
Christopher calm

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,600
there'll be no comments I just I just

00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,649
decided I was like no I'll put a link at

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,909
the bottom says hey if you want to chat

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,769
with me about this right go to Twitter

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,330
and tweet something at me and then I can

00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,600
decide if I want to see it or respond to

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:15,889
it or not but you just have to learn

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,190
boundaries alright I told you a bunch of

00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:20,450
mistakes and lessons I learned but maybe

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,460
the most important lessons I've learned

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,869
in life haven't come from mistakes

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,889
they've come from the game right how

00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:33,950
many of you have ever played chess

00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:36,169
before okay so you get it these are

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:40,070
super important lessons for me I hope

00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:43,879
they're helpful to you look at the big

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:46,129
picture every single time someone writes

00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:47,929
me something every single time I see

00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,539
something on social media and I want to

00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:53,149
react I have to stop slow down counts 10

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:58,970
and look at the big picture is it even

00:28:53,149 --> 00:29:01,249
worth responding right hey know that

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,869
you're gonna win and lose it's just the

00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:04,850
nature of the beast you're gonna play a

00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,669
game sometimes you win sometimes you

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,590
lose it's not that big a deal I mean I

00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,879
suppose if you're competing and you're

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,860
like a national champion and you got

00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:14,690
spotlights on and TV show then yeah it's

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,619
a big deal but most of us if we're

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,720
playing chess we're playing with a

00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,860
friend or playing with a stranger but it

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,840
doesn't matter the stakes aren't that

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,429
high we tend to think that the stakes

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,470
are super high when it comes to life

00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:26,269
whether it's our job our product

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,830
whatever we're doing and the stakes just

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:32,320
aren't that high you're gonna win some

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,320
you're gonna lose some just relax

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,409
also just know that the more time you

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,220
invest the more work you put into it

00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:46,249
eventually you'll get better over time

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:48,169
you can't keep playing and not get a

00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:50,269
little better you can't keep blogging

00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,100
and not get better you can't keep

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,850
working with clients and not get better

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,980
it's just a rule of effort you have to

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,730
put in the time and energy to see a

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:06,170
result I hired a

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:09,080
I I don't want to characterize this

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,429
person by the age that they are or the

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,870
generation that they are because that

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:20,960
would be wrong okay so I am hi I hired

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:22,610
an entitled young lady I wanted an admin

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
to work for me in my house

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,750
granted my wife stays at home all the

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,070
time so it was a very safe environment

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,540
my kids are there all the time I just

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,809
want someone to do some admin work for

00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:38,470
me at the house and my house was too

00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:42,950
cold for her and I was like buy a jacket

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,390
it's my house and then I said hey I need

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,470
you to learn this stuff and I sent her a

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,400
video course and she's like I don't

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,030
learn by video courses so I sent her

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,100
text

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:56,720
you know tutorials and and she said I

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,070
don't I don't learn by reading so then I

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,940
gave it some mouse it you know just try

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,230
it out I don't learn by doing I think

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,500
she could have shortened out the whole

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:10,490
process by just saying I don't learn

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:13,850
right I was like this is insane but you

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,240
know what if if you're the kind of

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,860
person who just doesn't want to learn

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,929
then you own it you call it you say hey

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,570
I'm not interested in anything this fine

00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,740
start with that open with that and the

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,000
rest of us would be like okay cool

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,630
thanks I know where to put like you're

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,330
great at parties

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,100
but I don't want you to work with me

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,470
right but for the rest of us of course

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,559
you're gonna learn it's just that most

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,590
of us don't have time so of course my

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,380
challenge to you is make time take time

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,750
you give time to your clients write

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,100
yourself up as a client put in the books

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,170
I have a new client it's me and

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,520
therefore I have assignments for me and

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,080
I have to go do them just like I would

00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,100
for a client treat yourself like a

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,350
client and invest time in yourself if

00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,290
you put in the time you'll get the

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,090
results and then of course tell the

00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,190
people better than you right if you know

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,360
this about chess you know that you've

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,470
gonna you're gonna play people that are

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,940
better and the more you play people

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,050
better the better you're gonna get

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,820
you're gonna see things that you've just

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,809
never seen before and that's worthwhile

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:16,820
does that make sense

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:18,320
all right ultimately when I'm talking

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,399
about learning and putting in time and

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,980
all that I just want you to know

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,169
persistence is a superpower and it's a

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,880
superpower that's available to all of

00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:28,820
you you don't need to bring any

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,010
particular skills to the table to get

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,909
better at things by putting in the time

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:40,220
and the work does that make sense

00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:42,140
this is the interactive part all right

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,200
so I want to wrap up by talking about

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,340
our theme this morning right elevate we

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,870
think about elevate we're like ooh I

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,940
want it I want to elevate myself I want

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,770
to lift up my brand I want to be I want

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,740
to be more known how do I get myself and

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,179
my name out there more right and I'm

00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:01,520
gonna tell you instead of that kind of

00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:04,730
elevate shine a light I make it a habit

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,320
if I'm meeting someone new and it's

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,850
someone that I'm going to be doing work

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,510
with I ask them enough questions so that

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:18,559
the next person that walks up to us I

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:19,820
can brag on my new friend but I can't

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,880
brag on them if I don't know anything

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,620
about them right I can't I can't say

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,279
okay hey I want to introduce you my

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,600
friend Zack and Zack remind me what

00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,000
coming do you work for right that's not

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,380
a great introduction but if I said I

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,110
want to introduce you to my friend Zack

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,720
and he just recently finished his agile

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,940
CRM sort of a j'l consulting in

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,470
notifications he said he's an agile guy

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,330
he's a guru he's a project manager who

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,950
knows how to pay attention so if I start

00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,779
talking about scrum and agile and

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,000
everything he's just recently done right

00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,559
then the other person goes oh well

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,539
that's actually I need to talk to you

00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:55,309
about project manager but also Zack goes

00:33:53,539 --> 00:34:00,020
oh he actually was listening he knows me

00:33:55,309 --> 00:34:03,350
that's that's important right shine the

00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,149
light on other people and to do that you

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,960
have to know who they are and to do that

00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:11,540
you have to ask some questions so I want

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,950
to let all of you know that today while

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,659
you're walking through this camp in that

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,760
hallway track where people come up to

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,200
you you should be prepared to answer a

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,550
lot of questions about yourself because

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,540
all these people are going to come up to

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,540
you and they're not just gonna say so

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,929
what do you do instead they're going to

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,159
ask you better questions

00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:30,859
like what have you learned in the last

00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,270
six months

00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:37,159
what are you super excited about right

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:39,839
now where do you see these things going

00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,480
and collect the information so that when

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,779
you can say I want to introduce this

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,639
person to this person I want to shine a

00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:49,049
spotlight on what they're doing I have a

00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,599
lot of friends that do a lot of work in

00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:53,190
the WordPress space and I love putting a

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,660
light on them and saying look at what

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,460
they're doing they're doing great I bet

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,000
every one of you has a competitor in

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,220
this room I work for a hosting company

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,720
right liquid web there's a lot of

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,339
hosting companies that show up to these

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,779
events and what I can tell you is

00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:15,180
they're all awesome

00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:16,230
they're great every one of these hosting

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,309
companies does something slightly

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,109
different for a different kind of

00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:20,910
audience and there's no reason that we

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:22,500
have to all be like oh well I I'm the

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,829
best I'm the only one and you should not

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,930
look at anyone else with me it's a lot

00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:31,200
better if I'm talking to someone and I

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,849
hear oh I have you know I have a small

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,109
budget I'm trying to test something out

00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:35,490
but the real thing I need is I need a

00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,470
lot of phone calling I knew whatever and

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,609
I go okay well hey let me show you my

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,589
buddy Adam over here who works at

00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:42,359
GoDaddy and let me see if you know they

00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:46,369
have a phone line you can call anytime

00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:49,020
to ask questions putting that light on

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,760
Adam and GoDaddy is gonna be much more

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,140
effective than just elevating my name in

00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:00,539
my game that make sense all right

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,039
empower I know we think of empowering as

00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:03,660
coming alongside someone else and

00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,279
teaching them something I want to

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,500
suggest to you that empowerment can also

00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:10,190
be coming alongside someone and asking

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,190
for help

00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:15,150
you know what it's like when you ask

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,260
someone else for help they go I can't

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,559
believe you think I could help you with

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,240
that they also go I don't know if I know

00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,150
the answer

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,360
and then they try it and discover that

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,070
they do know the answer and what you've

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,090
just given them is the gift of

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,619
self-confidence because they now know

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,100
how to do something and they just taught

00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,080
it to you one of my favorite things at a

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,420
work camp right is to open up my laptop

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,920
if we're out there hanging around and I

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,170
get stuck on something and instead of me

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,580
just pounding out 15 20 30 minutes

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,690
trying to figure out I just call people

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,160
over hey does anyone know how to fix

00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,420
this and you'll discover some people

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,750
like I am the same problem and other

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,230
people like it's just click here go to

00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,490
this thing check that box I don't know

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,380
if you've used Gutenberg but if you go

00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,430
to publish a post you hit publish and

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,480
then it pops up and says do you want to

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,830
publish and then right after that says

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,910
hey are you sure you are publishing like

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,360
did I have to push the publish button

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:12,510
three times now like who came up with

00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,800
that idea and then someone else is like

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,210
no there's a setting you can go in and

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:21,480
tweak this in changes and it shows it on

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:24,330
macbayne you're like thank you right ask

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,490
people for help give them the

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,320
opportunity to help you and give them

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,910
the opportunity to develop the

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,690
confidence this is actually I do know

00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,920
something about this most the time we're

00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,090
looking forward we're looking at all the

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,619
people that know more than us we don't

00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,990
look behind us at all the people to know

00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:44,640
less than us and the truth is we know if

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,790
you've been working with WordPress for

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,530
ten minutes you could get on the

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,660
wordpress.org forum and support and

00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,920
answer questions I swear to god you're

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,330
like ten minutes I don't know anything

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,530
I'm like do you know how to log into

00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:59,930
your site and I yes guess what

00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,590
there's an entire forum of people who

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,790
don't know how to log in to their site

00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,640
they don't even know where to go to log

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:12,740
in and you're like well I know that

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:16,630
great you can now teach and lastly

00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:18,740
engage and I hide of this already right

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,420
most time we talk about engagement like

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,450
join the community get involved find a

00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,400
group yet connected help out I want to

00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:29,270
tell you just start connecting part of

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,800
the rest of your community start

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,800
introducing one person to another person

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,170
people that don't know each other and

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,140
just take them and say I think you

00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:43,880
should know this person and connect the

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:46,070
dots if you are a dot connector you will

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,490
engage more of the community and more of

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,390
the community will gauge itself and

00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,210
you'll turn yourself into like a

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,980
superstar networker just by doing

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,610
something relatively simple introducing

00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,440
one person to another yesterday I was

00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,660
talking to someone and I just spent like

00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,970
2 or 3 days ago I just talked to Brad at

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,120
cookie and then yesterday I'm talking to

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,770
someone and I was and I just went I need

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,200
to introduce you to my friend Brad

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:16,460
because your company could use what his

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:19,910
company does and I will this next week

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,230
right and when I do that that company is

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,850
gonna go oh man I thank you so much for

00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:26,540
introducing Brett that's it oh thank you

00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:29,780
so much for you I went two times and I

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:35,810
don't have to do any work I love that

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:38,240
kind of winning right so this morning as

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:42,830
we talk about these three things right

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,750
oh whoops as we talk about elevating as

00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:48,470
we talk about empowering as we talk

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,600
about engaging my challenge to you is to

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,550
do the things that you don't normally do

00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,410
to be different than you normally are to

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,480
get out of the comfort zone

00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,740
and to try some new things interacting

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,690
with new people putting a spotlight on

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,390
people when instead you've normally been

00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:06,980
ready to tell your story connect some

00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:08,990
dots ask for help and watch as your

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,810
