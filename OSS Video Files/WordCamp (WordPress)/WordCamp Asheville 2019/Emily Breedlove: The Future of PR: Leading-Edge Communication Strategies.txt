Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	Nothing is what it used to be. The worlds of marketing, communications, and public relations are in a constant state of evolution. Those who work within these spaces need to be highly aware of how the convergence of story & technology is dramatically changing the ways in which humanity fosters connection. Communication strategies are no longer linear or sequential, they are three-dimensional, and that has a massive effective on PR tactics.

all right so good morning my name is

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,190
Emily Breedlove and I am so excited to

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,850
be back at WordCamp this is my fourth

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,699
year I think speaking here and so I

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,619
already prefaced the camera guy so there

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:29,699
were two years that my video didn't make

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:31,529
it because I I swear a lot this year I'm

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,340
bound and determined to get my video

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,020
back on word camp so I'm gonna slow down

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,540
and not try not to cuss

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,050
I may have to catch myself a couple

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,210
times so just bear with me but so my

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,010
name is Emily Breedlove and I am a

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:58,379
serial entrepreneur here in Asheville

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:59,820
and we actually got one thank you so

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,670
I've been a serial entrepreneur for long

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,170
longer than I knew what that was started

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,420
as an entrepreneur when I was in high

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,840
school but then I had a brief stint

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,210
where I worked for the government I

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,810
almost killed myself entrepreneurs can't

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,810
handle that but what it did give me was

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,229
insight into how a lot of things work

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,210
one of those things is PR of how

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,939
nonprofits work how government agencies

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,350
work how the media works and how as

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,450
entrepreneurs were typically left out of

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,390
those conversations that we don't always

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,000
get the playbook and so when I left my

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,409
government job and came back to being an

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,710
entrepreneur came back to who I really

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,520
am I vowed to bring that insight and

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,659
those tools and resources to my people

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,290
and so what I'm going to be talking

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,860
about today is not about the history of

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,979
PR not about what PR is the more about

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,469
how you navigate it now and what are the

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,990
things that people don't always tell us

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,030
as entrepreneurs that we tend to be left

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,610
out of those conversations so I'm trying

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,200
to pull back the curtain of what is the

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,360
current state and what is the future

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,770
state of public relations to give you

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,050
guys some insight on how to better

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,600
navigate it as entrepreneurs is

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,680
developers as marketers because we're in

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,570
this space whether we know it or not so

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,980
Who am I like I said I am a serial

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,690
entrepreneur I do way too many things

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,470
but there are a handful of things that

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,650
are going to help frame this

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,530
conversation so I'm the director of

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,240
scale-up WNC which is a growth

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,940
accelerator here in Asheville it's run

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,580
by Mountain biz works and we take a

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,830
cohort of 15 existing locally

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,190
headquarter companies that have the

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,710
potential to scale 10x within three

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,840
years and so we send them through an

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,940
intensive seven week program where we

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,190
help them build their growth plan look

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,410
at their capital needs and part of that

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,670
is also looking at their communication

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,790
strategy to scale is a really intense

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,640
process and it challenges your

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,990
communication verbage methodology

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,760
toolkit strategy all those things and so

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,370
we actually just finished our last

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,770
cohorts our spring cohort we're about to

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,480
start our summer cohort on Friday so

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,650
we've got 15 new businesses that are

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,700
coming in and those are companies that

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,709
range between 250,000 annual revenue to

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,160
two and a half million but they can

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,770
demonstrate the capacity to 10x and

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,110
three years what's exciting about this

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:38,160
summer cohort is it's the first time

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,860
that we have had infopreneur x' we've

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,720
had idea based product we've had

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,490
companies that sell digital products

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,180
going through the cohort and that's

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:50,220
really challenged our curriculum where

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,260
you have entrepreneurs that can very

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,630
realistically scale through a digital

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,580
product and what that then looks like

00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:02,480
the vast majority of the businesses that

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:06,240
we have have tangible product beer food

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,400
outdoor gear that sort of thing but so

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,230
this is the first year and this is when

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,300
I push really hard because in in

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,690
Asheville we have a lot of idea preneur

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,430
so we have a lot of freelancers

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,799
entrepreneurs that do specialize in in

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,960
passive revenue and online product and

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,590
really looking at how we teach more

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,530
around scaling within that space so

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,240
another

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,740
roll that I play in this community is

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm the founder and director of camp

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,810
girl boss you guys got postcards we have

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,330
some if you want more

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,670
and so camp robust is a week-long summer

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,430
camp that supports middle school girls

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,740
in focusing on leadership and

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,840
entrepreneurship and so over the course

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,000
of the week we work with the girls not

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,860
only to build a business but instead of

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,710
writing a business plan they build a

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,180
single page WordPress website so thanks

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,510
to boomer sassman over there are pre

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,690
camp trainer so we offer a mini pre camp

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,880
for these middle school girls Thursday

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,160
afternoon of the week we've spent all

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,440
week compiling the pieces that would go

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,970
into a single page site so their bio

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,860
their mission statements they get a

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,450
headshot they create a logo they create

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,570
three products so it is an e-commerce

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,380
site and then we we send them through a

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,380
five-hour

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,060
web site boot camp basically a miniature

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,669
version of what boomer taught for pre

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,690
camp and that was something that I

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,280
really prioritized because nowadays if

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,490
you're an entrepreneur you need to learn

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,200
about how you convey that online the

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,490
standard business plan and standard

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,590
communication strategy is no longer

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,050
relevant and so even if we're supporting

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,090
eleven year old girls that won't start a

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,790
business for at least a decade at least

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,070
we're giving them the foundation of to

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,150
be relevant you need to look at digital

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,210
marketing you need to look at online PR

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,560
so there is information if you guys want

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,940
to check it out we're hosting ten camps

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,210
this summer all across Western North

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,830
Carolina and hopefully next year we can

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,040
create a stronger alliance with word

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,229
camp so then the last piece is I also

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,010
run a program called W NC Press Pass and

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,630
this is an ongoing event program where

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,880
we bring together the media

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,640
we also offer training and resources

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,979
around how to work with the media so the

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,330
more that I got into PR especially

00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,070
working with entrepreneurs in PR the

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,260
more that I realized that this is a

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,710
topic that's underutilized and

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,050
underserved there's very little classes

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,370
sarah jb media institute they do a lot

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,940
of training on this and they're one of

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:40,120
the few that do and that PR is a

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,250
target it is in a state of evolution and

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,440
so making sure that that we're

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,470
presenting classes that are not working

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,380
off of the standard narrative of what PR

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,180
used to be and instead looking at how to

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,310
be relevant and competitive right now

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,100
how to work with regional media outlets

00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,280
how to work with statewide how to get on

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,170
the larger blogs and articles how to

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,470
look at multimedia and all of these

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,770
things so WNC Press Pass

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,380
we now host an annual event in March so

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,940
stay tuned for that you can get on WNC

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,200
Press Pass comm or about to actually

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,210
start releasing some ongoing workshops

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,560
for people that are wanting to get more

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,120
aggressive at looking at writing press

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,850
releases and building relationships with

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,010
the media so those are three helpful

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:30,670
resources that kind of frame who I am

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:34,870
and how I see this world taking shape so

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:38,080
little backgrounds PR stands for public

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,510
relations is the act of managing your

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,800
public image or your reputation so my

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,520
background is actually in branding and

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,470
marketing and their branding and PR like

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,600
two sides of the same coin branding is

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,540
you managing your reputation from being

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,770
able to actually own your narrative own

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:03,520
your imaging own the way that people

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,710
experience your brand's PR is when you

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,380
hand it over to someone else and let

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,380
them tell your story and having to

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,990
actively manage how the press talk about

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,120
what you do how partners share that

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,919
information how press releases convey it

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,620
you're officially handing it off to

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,230
someone else and trying to work with

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,780
them on how to maintain the brand

00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,210
experience that you've invested a lot of

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,120
time and energy around how to maintain

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:35,770
the integrity of your story and so they

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,270
do work closely together but PR the few

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:41,659
things that you want you to focus on is

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,839
the management aspect this is very

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:47,120
if managing your PR is you need to

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,990
engage and manage it on a daily basis

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,759
and the public image and the reputation

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,250
so that is how the world sees you

00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,629
that is how other people talk about your

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,519
business or talk about the work that

00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:03,620
you're doing or your clients work so for

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,199
the history of PR typically there were

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,769
some major players that held all the

00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:14,779
power the media outlets journalists

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:17,449
newspapers news celebrities that got

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,509
most of the attention and then

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:22,519
advertising the paid PR what's

00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:25,610
interesting is that these dynamics have

00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,920
changed everything in PR has changed

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,970
thanks to some very big pivot points

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,269
that have happened over the past few

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:37,910
years the biggest new player right

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:41,149
the average show any person now can be

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,149
part of that that process the power

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:48,319
dynamics have shifted in that people

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:51,709
normal people can now be in this network

00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:54,170
that we can actually have more influence

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,480
over our PR and that we are actually

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,509
emerging more as peers to the

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,339
celebrities to the media to the

00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:06,139
advertisers individuals now have the

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,449
ability to become influencers and

00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,980
thought leaders within this space thanks

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:13,430
to all the shifts that have happened

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,009
it's given us as people more power to

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,529
craft and manage our public relations to

00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:20,720
own our reputation and our public image

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,120
out in the world and so what I'm going

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,399
to talk about is how we now navigate

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,059
that space how we embrace the fact that

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,550
we have more power in owning our PR and

00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:34,910
in growing our presence growing our

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,290
reputation growing our base so the

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,209
reality is is that thanks to the global

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,889
and the digital communication revolution

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,339
that we've looked at is it's given

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:45,889
access to the world that we're able to

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,910
get online and and share our story in

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,149
ways that we never have before

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,870
obviously we all know this how do we do

00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,250
that no we're looking at how this sea of

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,250
people out there

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,260
this noisy world of everyone trying to

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,050
be heard how do you cut through that

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,660
noise and how do you successfully build

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:10,550
your tribe or grow your space grow your

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:12,590
footprint grow your network so everyday

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,600
people now have access in a way that we

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,750
never really did but it also challenges

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,500
the strategy that we use in navigating

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,380
that it's not just sending something

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,420
sending a press release to a journalist

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,710
yes that's so part of the process but

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,020
you are having to actively engage in

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,820
what that strategy looks like there's a

00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,940
lot of work that goes into this there's

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,800
a lot of clarity that is required on

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,690
behalf of managing your own PR and

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,890
really stepping into the space from a

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:47,990
place where you are successful so how do

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:50,780
you do this all of these things have

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,940
helped build your base the tools that

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,120
you're going to use multimedia video

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,980
audio photos these are tools that you're

00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,300
able to use social media obviously is

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,670
helping to spread the word it helps

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,220
level the playing field digital products

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,470
- standalone products that help to build

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,890
your newsletter helped to build your

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,630
network and then the 24-hour news they

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,370
are always looking for stories so the

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,280
reality is that just the nature of the

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,530
media has shifted in that they are

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,510
constantly trying to find good stories

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,730
they're always out looking and so making

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,410
sure that that you've built it in a way

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,020
that fits within their space and then

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,190
you get it on their radar it's really

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,600
opened up this this Avenue okay so the

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,730
reality is is that we can now create our

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,650
own global platform I'm really

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,650
understanding what that looks like that

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:43,370
we have the ability as individuals when

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,350
we build a foundation of all of these

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,560
resources all these tools and get really

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,839
clear on what it is that we want to do

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,380
but even though we have more power it's

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,140
still a partnership we still have to

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,760
work with these players that's one of

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,080
the biggest challenges that I found is

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,850
that a lot of entrepreneurs that are

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,730
that take initiative and that are super

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,790
aggressive within the space they can be

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,089
bullish they can plow their way through

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,589
and

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,089
think that if they've got a great story

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,949
it'll just be covered and it should be

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,149
covered but the reality is is that

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,990
you're still having to work with people

00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,189
you're still having to work with

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,300
organizations you're still having to

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,819
learn how to build these relationships

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,759
and get them to want to run your story

00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:26,899
so it is a delicate process that you

00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:28,970
still need to learn how to navigate but

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,309
once you do figure out what that looks

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,129
like it is a mutually beneficial

00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:36,529
exchange because the media needs good

00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,029
stories and once you learn how to

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,129
generate good stories you're able to

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,350
give them what they need people want to

00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:44,269
read good stories reporters want to

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,129
write good stories media outlets want to

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,930
run good stories good stories are hard

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,980
to find there's a lot of really bad

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,370
stories out there

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,209
most people pitch bad stories they're

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,470
typically mediocre and self-serving

00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:00,379
they're usually flat and they're not

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,149
providing enough and so really looking

00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:06,499
at that this is a give-and-take

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:09,139
relationship and that's by taking the

00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:11,300
extra steps to find a good story

00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,100
to craft a good story and then pitch it

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,420
in a way that they understand the media

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,209
outlet understands how it's applicable

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,899
to their readership you're serving than

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:23,209
everybody yourself your clients their

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,949
reporter their media outlet and the

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,470
people at large who really need good

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,149
stories to read so all of this is a very

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,249
healthy symbiotic relationship when you

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,610
understand your role in that put in that

00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:35,809
place okay so what do you do how do you

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:42,350
how do you start tackling this so I

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:44,389
broke this up into actually removed like

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,509
the researched based tactics on here and

00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:50,990
I got really real with you on what I

00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,699
actually see works so first you have to

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,949
live with integrity you have to operate

00:14:52,699 --> 00:15:00,230
from a place of integrity the reality is

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:03,069
is that once you move into this space

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:09,470
and you become more visible the world

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:11,360
expects more from you live with

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,300
integrity unless you want to be known

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,890
for your crazy if that's part of your

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,290
brand sure

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,140
but the reality is that this is still

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,650
very relationship based the people want

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,060
to hear from those who they trust media

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,810
outlets want to work with people who

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,360
they trust visibility comes with pros

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,950
and cons that there is that element of

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
transparency when you're using these

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,200
platforms like social media people then

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,450
know you they see you and so you really

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,550
have to then it be careful what you

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:49,140
share and be calculated around the story

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:54,750
and the brand experience that you are

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:57,270
putting out there so for me I hit this

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,500
clip really fast that for the majority

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:03,300
of my career my operated pretty under

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,980
the radar that I worked with the

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,120
government I worked with grants I worked

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,030
with entrepreneurs but it was still

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,340
pretty quiet but then a couple of years

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,170
ago I started more aggressively stepping

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,050
into this space and it was like a

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,940
perfect storm and I went from having a

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,670
network of 2,000 people to having a

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,960
network of 50,000 people in about six

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:28,170
months and not being really prepared for

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,540
what that level of visibility entailed

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,110
that all of a sudden I had a lot of

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,660
people knowing what my kids names were

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,130
and knowing where I went out to eat with

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,740
my husband the night before and knowing

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,510
that my mother-in-law was sick I started

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,400
becoming highly aware of the things that

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,890
I was sharing because there were a lot

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,870
of eyes on it I also had to go back and

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:56,720
look at the posts that I had shared that

00:16:51,870 --> 00:17:00,570
were still archived so I was part of

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,900
when Facebook first launched it was only

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,730
for universities and I was part of I was

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,910
one of the first four universities that

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,000
beta-test pated tested Facebook I went

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,490
to the University of Central Florida and

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,860
we were one of the first floor and so my

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,420
Facebook account goes back to when I was

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,770
in college right and you know when you

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,920
first start it was just for other

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,150
college kids and so like my first year

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,430
of photos or like should

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,980
never seen the light of day ever ever I

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,710
had to go back and remove all of the

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,930
Cool Whip wrestling matches and jello

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,350
shots from my college experience because

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,240
it was still there obviously Facebook

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,490
has evolved since then my grandparents

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,170
are now on Facebook and if they dug far

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,270
enough back they would have seen a part

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,210
of me that I didn't want everyone to see

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,280
and so it not only went out and scrubbed

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,640
the photos but I also scrubbed some of

00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,880
the posts when I was not as professional

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,210
as I want to be now because that's their

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,240
and it's permanent and so being really

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,240
clear on what your line of integrity is

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,070
is really important because the more you

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,070
open yourself up to the world the more

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,480
that's gonna be challenged the more that

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,670
you're gonna have to hold that boundary

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,510
for yourself and that things will happen

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,840
bad things will happen

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,490
damage control will kick in being clear

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,130
on on how you are personally going to

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,080
hand handle crisis and that you have

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,720
your crisis communication strategy in

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:40,330
place in a place that is in alignment

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:42,400
with your integrity so even just just 24

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,170
hours ago I have been getting emails

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,910
from Allina bowl have you guys heard of

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,590
a line a ball has anybody been getting

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,740
this for a year and a half I've been

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:53,590
getting those just this week one of my

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,210
close colleagues signed up for it and I

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,010
it triggered and I got an email from him

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,190
and I was like okay well if he's gonna

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:05,520
do it then I guess I should do it within

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:08,170
10 minutes Allina ball had spammed all

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,280
150,000 contacts that I had in my email

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,960
list ten minutes right because I made a

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,080
rookie mistake of not reading the fine

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,390
print and so I immediately had to then

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,780
switch into damage control that every

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:26,530
single scale up alumni got spammed from

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:29,140
me through a line a ball on top of my

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:33,220
funders on top of my partner's on top of

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:36,610
my clients and so I had to like very

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,130
aggressively delete the account start

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,580
emailing people posts on my social media

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:46,869
like I apologized for that

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,610
I lost PR points on that one because it

00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,799
rubs people the wrong way because I

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,820
didn't read the fine print and so that's

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:58,739
part of my integrity is that I take the

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,860
privacy of my network very very

00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,230
seriously

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,720
I do not abuse the fact that I have a

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,440
big network I do not abuse their trust

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,869
in me and so I've had to be very clear

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,629
on what my lines are when it comes to

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:17,249
these things and because the more you

00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:19,480
navigate PR it can swallow you whole

00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,100
press can get really exciting and

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,499
reporters can ask a lot of you and they

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,259
can spin stories and you need to keep

00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:27,639
going back to what is your line of

00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,239
integrity and what does that look like

00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:32,619
and how do you maintain that so the

00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:36,700
dominant currency is still within this

00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:38,769
space is trust this is still a network

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,950
of people even in working with big-time

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,730
media outlets they're still people

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,169
especially when you're just getting

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,989
started you're usually working with the

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:51,220
the young people they get younger every

00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:54,460
year report about me the other day and I

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:59,409
was like how old are you and I didn't I

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,820
actually didn't want to know but being

00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:01,989
highly aware of the fact that even

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,909
though they have a really big name

00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:05,169
behind them there's still just a mom or

00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,450
they're still just a kid right out of

00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,259
college or they're still an overworked

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,929
journalist

00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,059
and that's treating them with respect

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,710
and treating them the way that that you

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,320
want to be treated as a person as a

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,210
human being is really really important

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,710
and and really striving to maintain that

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:26,619
trust in an ongoing way number two do

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,359
stuff that matters like I said the most

00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,330
most of the stories that are pitched are

00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,369
bad they're bad stories they're mediocre

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,899
no one wants to read them they're very

00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,109
self-serving they're about a

00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:39,820
ribbon-cutting ceremony or you know

00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:43,149
someone who just released a new book or

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,489
and these can be interesting if they're

00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:50,740
not only about you and your business and

00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:53,799
so nowadays you know it's taken a long

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,580
time I host a lot of events god I've

00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,640
been doing it for so

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,230
my husband hates that I do because

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,510
they're exhausting and they're always a

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,840
risk and for the first 10 years I bombed

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,210
my events I never made money off of them

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,279
they were exhausting most of them didn't

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,340
work but that was how I learned and I've

00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,049
so I estimate that I've lost over a

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,460
hundred thousand dollars over the course

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,169
of my career in hosting events that I

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,090
personally had to make up the difference

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,919
so I joke and I say that I have a PhD

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,350
now and hosting events like an Ivy

00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,880
League PhD the best money can buy right

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,240
because that's how you learned in the

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,710
school of hard knocks but so it took me

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,980
that long to realize that people only

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:39,850
want to go to things that really pull on

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,880
certain elements and that sellout events

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,940
the strategy behind crafting and

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,710
defining an event that sells out is is

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,960
something that you really have to work

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,370
at an understanding and at mastering

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,399
that craft and so there's a few things

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,990
that I've identified of how I vets what

00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:00,549
matters and that I not only now create

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,580
articles and programs around this but I

00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,809
also advise all of my clients to so the

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,080
reality is the world is noisy and

00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:10,360
saturated you've got to cut to oh and

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,529
that in general people don't care they

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,600
don't care about your stuff they don't

00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:15,940
care about your story they care about a

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,980
handful of things and so like just

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,450
accepting that like just because you

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,220
write a story doesn't mean people care

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,960
about it so what makes them care first

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,240
and foremost something that makes them

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,639
feel good about themselves right that is

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,080
always the biggest motivator you've seen

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:36,940
a thousand posts of science study says

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,019
that those who sleep in in the morning

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,510
are naturally brilliant right studies

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,799
say that those who swear all the time

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,870
are brilliant

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,940
studies say that those who have a dirty

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,690
desk are smarter than those who have

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,620
clean desk

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:56,200
it's who hears but people look at it and

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,760
they're like that's me right I have a

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,630
dirty desk I swear all the time and I

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,090
sleep in I'm brilliant yay me but it

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,580
also helps people prefer to go to things

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,840
and to read stories that validate who

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,590
they

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,920
our have an element of exclusivity so a

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,980
lot of my events I make people feel like

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,370
I am personally inviting them to come

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,490
and not everyone is invited to come it

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:28,290
showcases things that make people feel

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:30,240
like I am special I am on I'm on the

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,100
inner circle I'm in the in-crowd I'm

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,260
doing something right and so really

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,260
focusing on the angle that makes the

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,090
reader feel good about themselves that

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,270
it's validating something that that's

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,760
either about them or that they're doing

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:47,610
or gives them a positive way to improve

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,530
themselves the next is a curiosity

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,000
factor and this is actually really hard

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,010
one to pull off because you have to

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,960
really understand your demographic and

00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,760
what they're curious about just because

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,410
you're curious about it doesn't mean

00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,160
that you're talking to those people who

00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,650
care about it

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,930
so curiosity is very much of the novelty

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:10,050
this is where you write stories or hosts

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:14,420
events that are like not-to-be-missed

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:16,950
kind of thing so for the scale-up

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,960
program at the end of scale-up we always

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,750
have a demo day event right it's the

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,310
showcase events and the first one we did

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,420
was like five years ago and it was the

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,010
first time that there was a quote

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,720
unquote demo day and we had that the

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,460
orange peel and it was huge it was super

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,860
exciting

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,970
now like three other organizations host

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,250
demo days and so it's really weakened to

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,470
the brand and so we haven't really had a

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,510
whole lot of like big exciting

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,970
attendance it's not a not like the not

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,260
to miss kind of event anymore and so

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,750
this year we went back to the drawing

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,570
board and I asked my team I was like

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,200
okay are y'all gonna like really let me

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,870
do this

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,290
like really can I bring out like all the

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:02,250
things that would make this fun and so

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:07,380
they hesitantly said yes but so this

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,370
year demo days is switching to the big

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:14,510
ask

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:17,870
pitch event the big ask pitch

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,510
it's a rock-and-roll themed event it's

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,490
the scale up throwdown

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,350
it's gonna be fun it's gonna be edgy

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,350
there's gonna be a band there's gonna be

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:32,510
beer it will sell out really fast

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:35,150
because people are going to have a lot

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,700
of curiosity on what it'll be this is

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,290
where the cool factor lives right that

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,660
you are presenting things and

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:45,140
opportunities that people would never

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,280
miss it but everybody's gonna be like

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,520
dude have you heard about the big ass

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,520


00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:55,670
that's pretty far down the line but it

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,220
paints that picture like the curiosity

00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,930
is actually one of the biggest variables

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,250
to look at when you are doing PR it's

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,010
one of the hardest because you have to

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,680
really know your market and it doesn't

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,060
always resonate with everybody and so

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,440
this is a challenging one to pull off

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,580
but once you figure it out it can be

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,400
really successful the next one is fear

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:22,400
and this comes in the fear of missing

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:25,490
out but also fear around the topic so

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,390
like climate change or health crisis or

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,010
violence or domestic violence or gun

00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,020
violence or any of these things that is

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,630
a huge motivator that people want to

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,760
learn as much about as possible

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,700
but this is also a challenging one to

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,980
navigate because you can take it too far

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:45,050
but also knowing when you do release it

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,940
of who the market is that it is whatever

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,340
it is that you're presenting is going to

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,260
trigger that with them but that you are

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,380
presenting it in a way that it's not

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,190
just capitalizing off of their fear but

00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:03,170
it's also offering some sort of solution

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:04,490
remedy support around that so then

00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,580
there's the inspiration piece and this

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,110
is like with camp girl boss so camp girl

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,660
boss is the kind of story that sells

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,980
itself I don't have to work hard at all

00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:19,190
to get coverage I'm actually I media

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,110
bangs down my door they all want their

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,610
own version of the story but it's the

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,620
kind of story that everyone wants to

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,020
hear about everybody wants to read about

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,340
11 year old girls who are over the

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,929
course of a week learning to

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,210
even themselves and finding the power of

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,799
their voice right so one of the most

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,380
powerful stories that we got out of camp

00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,710
girlboss is that so last year we hosted

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,970
one big camp here at UNCA and at the end

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,880
of the week

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,010
WLOS came as we were in pitch practice

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,179
so the final graduation ceremony the

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,150
girls stand up and they share their

00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:54,260
websites as well as give their 60-second

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,549
pitch and so a reporter came and right

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,020
when we were in the middle of practicing

00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:58,789
and they asked if one of the girls could

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,340
stand up and say her pitch and so of

00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,720
course every girl was like I want to so

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,390
we brought their name in a hat and drew

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,159
it out in the girl that we picked

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,200
she was pretty timid pretty quiet but

00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,279
she did it she stood up she read her

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,799
pitch she did great and it wasn't until

00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:20,270
the week after that her mom called me

00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:22,190
and said so I wanted to share what

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,429
happened after the camp because you

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:29,419
wouldn't have known she said so she came

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:30,620
home and over the course of the camp she

00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:32,960
had started a business around like a

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,740
dog-walking business it was cute she

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,809
loves animals

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,929
I swear half the girls either did

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,460
animals or they did cupcakes yeah

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,110
boomer can attest we had more stock

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,110
photos of cute puppy dogs than anything

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,330
else but so the girl went home and she

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,340
immediately locked herself in a room and

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:52,039
she reworked her whole business because

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,950
what I didn't know was that she had

00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:57,049
dyslexia and that she never wanted to

00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,809
speak in front of the class because she

00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:01,789
would always screw it up and she said

00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:05,299
that the experience at camp robots

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:08,240
taught her that she found the power of

00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:09,559
her own voice and so she instead started

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,220
a business where she helped other girls

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:16,070
with dyslexia learn how to stand strong

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,970
in their voice so the mom called me

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:23,090
we're both sobbing right this story is

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,690
one that everyone wants to hear the

00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,220
inspiration story is tied to the making

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,850
yourself feel good about yourself giving

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:36,340
yourself hope about the worlds but again

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:39,980
you can't just halfway tell that story

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,210
you really have to lean into why is this

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,820
inspiring why is this

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:50,430
vulnerable why does this pull at the

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:52,950
heartstrings and how do I take that with

00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,940
a deep sense of responsibility because

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,870
with great power comes responsibility

00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,750
right

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:02,940
spider-man said that but so really

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,150
knowing with your people what inspires

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,530
them and how you drop these

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,410
inspirational stories and they're very

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:13,170
intentionally but carefully and again

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,790
like with fear not abusing it that you

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,770
can motivate people to do what it is

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:20,250
that you want when you share stories

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:28,650
that inspire them alright so number

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:30,300
three I'm get a time check oops number

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,330
three is that you need to tell the story

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,220
better better than everyone else so the

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,250
reality is is that all journalists are

00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,790
flooded with hundreds of stories a day I

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,500
know Katie who's the news director at

00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:49,650
Asheville so that sometimes gets between

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:52,410
300 and 400 emails a day a day right so

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,750
how do you cut through the noise and get

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,590
yours heard how do you get your story

00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,120
run so there's a lot of things that you

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,040
need to keep in mind as you're going

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,470
through this process and it's not just

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,580
the standard press release and so I

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,900
wanted to kind of pull this apart

00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,540
especially when we're looking at the

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,300
future of PR because this is a moving

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,430
target the media is having to adjust to

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,290
this just as much as we are we're all

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,120
learning how to navigate this space and

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,370
how to do it quickly

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,790
so these are the core elements what

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,650
what is the story angle so I typically

00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,870
when I'm going through this process I

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,900
pull apart and make a list so like with

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:34,680
camp girl boss we have I think 47 story

00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,510
angles that my PR specialist has and

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,600
every single story angle has some

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,520
information on it and so she's able to

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,190
for every conversation that she has that

00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,530
the media she's able to gauge which one

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,910
to take and she can throw one out and if

00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,760
that one doesn't land she throws out

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,470
another one so knowing what your angles

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,309
are and that every story can have

00:32:52,470 --> 00:33:00,080
multiple angles and knowing that each

00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:01,370
outlets so we've got like 30-something

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,139
outlets right now that we're talking to

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,570
for camp robots they're all gonna want

00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:07,129
their own version of a story they're not

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,139
very few of them are going to run the

00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:10,789
exact same press release and so we have

00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:12,320
to modify this we have to have different

00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:15,049
quotes we have to have different stories

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,669
and so knowing which outlets going to

00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,499
want which one the business north

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:22,190
carolina magazine is gonna be very very

00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:24,649
different than the WNC magazine and so

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,899
you pull that apart and really look at

00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:30,909
what are the angles what does it look

00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:34,279
like what's gonna make sense for who

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:36,799
then you get to who so this is where for

00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,559
each angle you're able to also map out

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,990
who your target markets are and this is

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,330
where you're able to modify so like for

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,999
the story angles we a lot of them are

00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,919
based upon I mean we've got 47 story

00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:51,019
angles there's probably only eight core

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,619
stories and those eights are then

00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:56,779
modified based upon this of who this

00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,669
would resonate with of this angle is

00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,759
really gonna land with mom's this angle

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:04,279
is going to land with professional men

00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:08,030
and so really mapping out who these

00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,619
people are and how they tie into the

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,260
core elements of the story and who is

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,970
gonna land land with best is going to

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,579
help you really clarify the next pieces

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,839
because then you understand how to round

00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:22,460
it out based upon who that demographic

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,470
is why and so this is going back to

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,500
those motivating elements of the

00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:29,510
curiosity the fear the inspiration why

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,810
are they going to care enough to listen

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:35,000
to this story why in the sea of stories

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,800
the thousands and thousands of stories

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,250
that come across people I mean they say

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,859
that right now we we're we've seen 8000

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:47,030
ads a day I would say that's that's

00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:49,159
growing but so we are so saturated with

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,389
stories right now why would this one cut

00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,300
through the noise and capture their

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:56,149
attention what about the languaging the

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,280
title the photo looking at what that

00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,540
hook is and what the intention is with

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,900
why you're presenting it and why it's

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,910
connecting that's going to help with

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,290
really clarifying what the title should

00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,609
be what the photo should be what the

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,600
opening lines should be what your

00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,670
keywords should be

00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,950
and where it lands based upon and it's

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:19,280
also about timing of why now is it in

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,780
alignment with so for us obviously it's

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,260
a bunch of moms getting ready for summer

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,330
right so come February we know moms are

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,710
stressing over summer camps and so at

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,570
that point we've got to start dripping

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:34,610
out stories because they're looking

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:36,080
they're actively looking how they want

00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,550
to hear it so this is the piece that's

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,140
really evolving aggressively right now

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,470
because there are so many other mediums

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,630
to keep keep in under consideration a

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,340
lot of demographics especially the

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,280
younger dinner demographics Millennials

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,770
they don't just want to read it right

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,690
they want the Cliff Notes version and

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,900
they want a video or they want a podcast

00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,450
and so you can't just send a 10 page

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,890
article anymore unless you're writing to

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,590
demographics of people who really like

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,270
to read the articles but so getting

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,160
really clear on once you understand who

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,360
these demographics are why it is that

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,710
they're wanting to listen you also then

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,020
need to understand the mediums in which

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,340
it needs to be delivered and so if it's

00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,460
gonna if it's the kind of story that

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,980
really needs to be heard find a podcast

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,360
to be interviewed on if it's a long

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,330
drawn-out story that has a lot of

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,300
statistics and a lot of quotes find a

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:29,360
journal an online journal that can do a

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,550
long academic analysis whatever it is

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,170
these mediums are what make or break

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,700
good stories you can have a great story

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,150
that you send to the wrong channel and

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,980
no one cares and that's sad that's sad

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:43,670
for your good story that then gets lost

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,190
in the chaos and then where they like to

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,020
find it so it's the reality is is that

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,600
even though there are certain mediums

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,950
that people want so if you're trying to

00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,500
get some Millennials and you've got a

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,000
great video you also need to be able to

00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,600
promote it in the spaces where they are

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,280
and so it's not just how they experience

00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,810
the story it's where they come across it

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,110
where they're gonna be most receptive is

00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,810
it via email newsletter is it on on

00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:11,360
social media is it on LinkedIn versus

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,640
Facebook if it's a professional story

00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,200
LinkedIn is clearly a great place to

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,490
drop a professional a business-related

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,730
story

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,950
face book maybe not and so it really

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,810
just depends on

00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,210
understanding who the market is

00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:29,030
understanding if it is a video or a

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,910
podcast what is the kind of channel that

00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,020
they're most receptive to listening to

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,339
email newsletters are really great for

00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,230
podcasts because people get them first

00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:38,300
thing in the morning they're able to

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,849
just download it at home and listen to

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,040
it in their car so really thinking

00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,230
through the digestibility of your

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,420
stories it's gonna make it easier

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,640
because the the press is also thinking

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,140
through that is this the kind of story

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,880
that needs to go out first thing on a

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,770
Tuesday morning or is this a Friday

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,920
afternoon kind of story

00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,349
they're already analyzing this and so

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,280
being able to be prepared and bring that

00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:06,170
information of this demographic they

00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,310
access these kinds of stories best

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,130
during the work day

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,780
we recommend releasing this between

00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,640
10:00 and 2:00 on Tuesday Wednesday

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,900
Thursday here's all the information that

00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,900
you would need in order to do that so

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,530
the secret to a lot of the things that I

00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:28,910
do is that I I put the time and energy

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:32,690
into doing it better that I over share

00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:34,880
with my press contacts I give them

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,880
several images to choose from

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,829
I give them links I give them quotes I

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,630
give them stats I give them everything

00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:44,630
that they need to create a great story

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,640
I also curate it I do my homework I

00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,730
research the reporter I research

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,819
research the the media outlets I use the

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:55,280
same exact words that they use and so it

00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:56,390
falls in line so as they're evaluating

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,859
and they're like all right these are the

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,770
hundred stories that we could run with

00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:02,270
which one fits the best if I'm speaking

00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,460
their language I'm automatically gonna

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,349
make it further if I provide them more

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,030
than they would need and they can then

00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:10,670
get to choose and they're not having to

00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:13,099
go manually go find an image it's gonna

00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,780
save them time so if you invest that

00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:16,040
it's a it's time and energy that they

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,520
don't have to invest and it makes it

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:24,109
easier to run it so number four do the

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,569
work the reality is is that when you are

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:28,250
navigating the pr space and you make

00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:30,589
your list right everybody needs to have

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,480
a list of all of your media outlets it's

00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:34,910
really good to in that list

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,720
differentiate what channels

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:41,299
they use where they they frequent if

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,920
they're just now emerging into the video

00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:45,740
space and they're actively looking for

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,690
good video if they have a really good

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,520
daily email newsletter and so they're

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,059
just looking for snippets all the time

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:57,020
they just always are digging for stuff

00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:59,900
being able to so on my media list we

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:02,960
have a very detailed Google sheet that

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:05,150
has each of the media outlets the

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,770
reporters that we personally know next

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,299
so reporters who talk about the topic

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:11,329
areas that they cover we also talk about

00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:13,789
the channels that they prefer to use we

00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:16,039
also notes where this outlet is going

00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:17,869
where they're trying to move into that

00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:21,200
they needed help generating that

00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:23,119
material and so like when I look at the

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,339
fact that Citizen Times just rolled out

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,130
a daily email newsletter and they're

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,039
trying to be morons in that space I can

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,539
send them stuff that will fit for that

00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,010
so this helps with your strategy because

00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:36,770
you also are able to quickly reference

00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,510
the more you take your PR seriously the

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,990
longer that list is going to get and so

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:44,329
being able to to go back and even just

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:47,690
search like which of my reporters covers

00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:49,609
food in Asheville who does food and

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,710
likes videos because we've got a great

00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,940
food video that we want to run from

00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,950
there you're able to kind of sift

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,789
through your database so we also use air

00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:01,279
table which is like the best database in

00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,779
the world it makes it easy for us to

00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:08,029
cross-reference and to find things

00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:10,220
quickly so your goal throughout all of

00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:11,750
this is not to just come up with a good

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,010
story but you need to make a good story

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,010
easy to tell for them

00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:20,809
PR and working with media outlets even

00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:23,740
though you're able to to grow your base

00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:26,960
a little easier now that you're able to

00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,480
to move more to their level they still

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,920
give you access and give you visibility

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,309
that you couldn't always get on your own

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,440
and so it's worth struggling through the

00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:38,890
headaches of learning how to work with

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,119
these people it's worth investing time

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,950
in getting to know them and building

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,830
relationships but also getting better at

00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:49,900
pitching stories so then

00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,030
the reality is is that you still do need

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,130
a press release it still is the the

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,540
standard piece that they work off of

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,190
even though now you need more than a

00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,960
press release the press release is the

00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,820
first thing that you send and so one

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,400
thing that we at the WNC Press Pass

00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,020
event on day 2 we bring in panels of

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,090
news directors and so we bring in news

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,800
directors from from Ashville from

00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,510
Western North Carolina from all across

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,310
the state and we ask them these

00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,780
questions of what is it that you want

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,160
from a press release what's the best way

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,320
to do that and so one thing that's

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,120
coming up really often is that they

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,620
actually prefer for the press release to

00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,930
be copied and pasted directly in the

00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,490
email but they don't want an attachment

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,680
they'd rather be able to quickly

00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,540
reference because typically the

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,590
attachments come in a variety of

00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,060
different mediums they don't want to

00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:36,250
have to dig through is it a word doc is

00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:38,500
it a PDF whatever and so they'd said put

00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,540
some sort of description of the story

00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,030
the key word description in the subject

00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:46,900
header don't just label it press release

00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:49,000
and then the opening sentence or lines

00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,190
from you is about why you think this is

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,160
relevant and so give them a very brief

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,140
synopsis of why this story would would

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,730
be strong for their readers and then

00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,310
immediately follow with the press

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:03,670
release in the email so they can just

00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:05,890
quickly scan through it from a time

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,390
standpoint that's the fastest way you

00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,460
can then just attach the images or you

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,530
can say we have images or you can put

00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,420
them in a Dropbox folder and link to the

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,700
images one of the biggest challenges is

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,260
if you haven't communicated with these

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,360
people before you want to try and avoid

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,530
links and attachments as much as

00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,020
possible because you can go to their

00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,730
spam folder and so usually I try to do

00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,920
just an introductory email that doesn't

00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:30,190
have any of those things so that we have

00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,870
we build that that connection but so

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,500
then the other pieces that you want to

00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:37,030
look at and this is a pretty big list

00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,510
video as much as possible so if you're

00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:42,700
able to do video on your own partner

00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,440
with people who do video try and get

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,810
interviewed on people who even just like

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,320
Facebook lives Facebook lies ultimately

00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:52,780
have a standalone video video is hot so

00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,170
is audio being interviewed on a podcast

00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,400
is is a great medium all of these media

00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,810
outlets are trying to move more into

00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,280
podcasting trying to figure out how to

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,190
do this

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,370
on going away photos are key you can't

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,780
just take Gmail or Google photos right

00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:11,190
everybody knows that you can't just copy

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,050
and paste by stock photography or if you

00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,080
have photos you need to be able to cite

00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,940
the source of where they come from you

00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,770
want to be able to provide a better

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,380
photo than what the media outlets gonna

00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,120
go find because ultimately it's going to

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,220
be more beneficial for you if it's a

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,470
really compelling engaging image you're

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,360
gonna get more clicks don't leave that

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,150
up to them you can even just give them

00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,650
direction ultimately if they go find

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,810
their own at least someone's you've sent

00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,130
have given them ideas of what you think

00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:42,480
it's going to be the strongest way to

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:44,190
engage the content obviously so

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,750
depending upon the publication some of

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,400
them are gonna want you to provide a

00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,620
press release that it's a complete story

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,390
that they can just run with or you're

00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,400
just providing the framework of a story

00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,350
that they would then work with you to

00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,870
write or there are some like capital at

00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,610
play they write all their stories and so

00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,530
you're just sending them an idea you're

00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:03,030
sending an idea and an opportunity and

00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,130
they then figure out how to slide it in

00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,300
where they have one of their one of

00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,730
their journalists write the story on

00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,710
your behalf but you have to at least

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,960
give them something to work off of and

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,060
so capital at play sending them a long

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,530
press release is just exhaustive right

00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,320
there they're just gonna circle back and

00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,730
be like well we write our own stories so

00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,490
we are you comfortable with this not

00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,980
being the actual story that we run and

00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,830
so knowing what they want so that it can

00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,760
be quickly reviewed and assessed

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,110
infographics are also really helpful if

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,210
you work with a designer and you can do

00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,770
something that is polished and

00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,750
professional especially if you are

00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,060
sharing data if you're sharing

00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,120
information depending upon the outlets

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,920
or the medium infographics can be really

00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,400
helpful so to kind of convey but also

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,880
make it compelling hyperlinks are also

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,040
really good for the this is good to

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720
embed within your press release so that

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,700
the the reporters can go back and

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,920
research and follow your tracks and they

00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:03,300
can help kind of validate the legitimacy

00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,590
of the story stats are also helpful so

00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,390
you don't want to drown them in stats

00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,010
you want to pick the most important the

00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,080
most relevant and then make put them in

00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,990
bold if you really want them to know the

00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,700
numbers

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:16,300
and then also link to the source of the

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,250
that information having partners is

00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:24,790
another element that does level the

00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:27,940
playing field so I have found in my over

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:29,740
the past two years that I can actually

00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,890
release the story through my own

00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:37,570
channels through my own network and tie

00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:40,420
it to partners and get a larger number

00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:42,220
of readers than if I was to just have

00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,070
that story go out on citizen x remount

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,600
Express that I've got stories that I'll

00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,790
have ten thousand people read it in

00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,220
three hours if I have the right people

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:54,369
partnered on the release of it and so

00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:57,040
not being afraid to ask some other

00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:59,650
influencers asking other organizations

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,170
that are heavyweights in this space to

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,330
also release or promote the story

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:07,210
sometimes you can bypass the media

00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,880
outlets with the right network and so

00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,770
being really clear on what is the

00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,350
strongest way to approach it if you have

00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,910
strong partners but then also if you do

00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,430
want to have it out in the media outlet

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,890
they're going to having a wide variety

00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,660
of partners is going to help really

00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,800
strengthen the story because they're

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,470
gonna recognize that there are other

00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,900
established organizations behind what it

00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:33,220
is that you're talking about quotes are

00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:35,650
also really good so I I set the stage

00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,200
for all my quotes I actually draft them

00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,750
first when I'm asking people for a quote

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,090
I know where the story is going I know

00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,670
what I want them to say so I'll draft it

00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,900
and then say are you good with this it's

00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,450
actually much easier and they prefer it

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,160
especially because you can then go to

00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,640
the executive director you can go to the

00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,440
CEO you can go to the top and and say

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,300
we're writing this story about this I'd

00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,710
really love it if if I could get it

00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,600
quote directly from you can you just

00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:04,600
approve this they're more likely to do

00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,609
that they'll edit slightly but if you

00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,119
ask them to write a quote dartz not

00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:12,340
happening you'll get a quote from their

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,390
their director of a program or a project

00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,190
manager you're not gonna get a

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,780
specialized quote unless you know the

00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,680
CEO and executive director really really

00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,690
well

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,510
so make it easy and make it relevant

00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,140
make it don't build the story around the

00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,030
quotes that you get

00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,580
work the quotes into the story that

00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,680
you're already writing alright number

00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,080
five don't be a jerk

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,450
you'd be surprised but I do have to say

00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,140
this on a regular basis especially with

00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,130
entrepreneurs just because you write the

00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,930
story doesn't mean they're gonna run it

00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:46,070
just because you write the story doesn't

00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:48,500
mean people want to read it so PR is a

00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,300
relationship business everything is

00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,290
about the role that you play in the

00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:57,280
community and how friendly and honest

00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:59,930
and supportive you are to these people

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:05,230
the reality is the industry right now is

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:08,660
a huge target politically economically

00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:11,660
journalism is under fire right the media

00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,250
it's fake news like everybody's blaming

00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,670
the media they're also running out of

00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,350
money

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,270
everybody's underpaid they're overworked

00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:20,480
like that was the biggest thing that we

00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:22,940
got out of WNC press pass is how hard it

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,670
is to be in this world right now and how

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:28,190
being the provider of the story it's

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,170
better if I am compassionate so the fact

00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,450
that these people are busting their

00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:35,090
butts trying to find good stories and to

00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:37,820
meet deadlines in a space that money is

00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:40,100
drying up faster like advertising is

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,350
disappearing these these media outlets

00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,990
are really struggling which means the

00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:46,250
reporters are getting paid less the

00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,360
other thing is that people who are in

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,580
this industry tend to stay in this

00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,460
industry and so even if they move from

00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,150
one paper to another if you're a jerk to

00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,550
them it's really hard to shake it they

00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:02,120
also have a really big microphone don't

00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:04,850
piss off the journalists these people

00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,190
are your voice just like when I said how

00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,990
brand is the reputation that you control

00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,270
PR is the reputation that you're handing

00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:13,340
off to someone else and so the last

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,020
thing you want to do is rub them the

00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:19,190
wrong way you're gonna get a bad story

00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,780
even if you get one and the more you

00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,790
treat them with respect the more they're

00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:26,390
gonna bend over backwards to get it done

00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:28,760
I've spent the past 15 years being nice

00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,440
to these people and sending them good

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,020
stories and working hard to get them

00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,440
what they need and now now when I call

00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,930
they answer they always read what I send

00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,780
them

00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:41,280
and even if it's it may not fit it may

00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,250
not work it may not run but they always

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,700
read it and so working towards that that

00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:49,260
in and of itself is is a worthy cause

00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,080
and then the reality is is that if you

00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,700
invest the time and you invest the

00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,200
energy and start building a real

00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,870
strategy and you've got all these tools

00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,210
the possibilities are endless you can

00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:03,290
get coverage anywhere the great story

00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:05,880
can end up anyway now and that's a great

00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,920
power for entrepreneurs and for

00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,270
storytellers and for marketers so I

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,590
would highly encourage you guys taking

00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,600
it seriously because you do have a lot

00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,930
more power than you think my team is

00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:18,720
here to help so just quick shout out I'm

00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,490
actually on in the works of opening up a

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,610
shared use podcast and video recording

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,650
studio in West Asheville and so part of

00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:28,110
this has been not only looking at the

00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,280
educational side of PR but also that

00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:31,410
there's not a lot of resources for

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,260
people that are trying to to advance

00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:35,520
their multi media generation and so

00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,530
having a podcast studio that you can

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,660
rent by the hour as well as video and

00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:41,340
live streaming so trying to make this

00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,570
more readily available to people who are

00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,780
trying to move into this space where

00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,730
it's expensive it's also complicated we

00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,520
also have editors producers designers

00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,500
in-house that can help with that stuff

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,950
so it'll be astral play comm we're

00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,600
opening up this summer and then my team

00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,370
is also then in partnership with that

00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,740
we're launching an ongoing educational

00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,020
series called the thought leader study

00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,400
hall and looking at we started

00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,530
recognizing that it's not just that

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,630
people need to walk in and sit in front

00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,590
of a microphone to start a podcast they

00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,350
need to understand what it actually

00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,910
looks like how they build a podcast how

00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,250
they build a series how they structure

00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,380
what they who they interview how they

00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,940
sell it once it's done and so the

00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,200
thought leader study hall is all of the

00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,030
pieces that go into that

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,460
looking at standalone products looking

00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:29,150
at ebooks looking at video courses at

00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,980
video at live streaming at podcasting

00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,330
membership programs keynotes all of that

00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,700
that come with really navigating this

00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:38,100
space and recognizing that there's just

00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,660
not a lot of education that's super

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,050
aggressive about what's happening right

00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:45,330
now within this space so there's my

00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:48,360
contact information all my social media

00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,829
handles is emily h briefed up so check

00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,299
out if you

00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:54,329
something probably the fastest way is

00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:58,469
either send me an email or get me on

00:52:54,329 --> 00:53:02,940
LinkedIn or Facebook cool oh look

00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:03,839
there's a clock that would be handy so

00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,719
we have five minutes so we have any

00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,719
questions yes

00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:23,710
nope and it just depends on the outlet

00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:27,280
so like a press release one a capital at

00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:29,710
play oh he just wants an outline he

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,670
wants to know what's the framework is it

00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:35,680
urgent what would what would we want

00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,960
from his team

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,280
if so Mountain Express does a great job

00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,050
of just running the press release

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,610
exactly as it is and so you'd want to

00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,380
send them everything ultimately they're

00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,480
just putting it on their blog so they

00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:49,780
don't have like a firm word count they

00:53:46,480 --> 00:54:10,810
want a complete press release so yeah it

00:53:49,780 --> 00:54:13,450
really just depends yes yeah yeah so

00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,760
this fall we also will have an intensive

00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:18,340
three-part workshop on the events

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,870
blueprint and so I'll that's one thing

00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,730
that I've started recognizing that we've

00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:23,350
now figured out how to do this and so

00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:28,240
there's a track for entrepreneurs and

00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:30,910
there's a track for nonprofits yeah so

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,190
if you just join like my facebook page

00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:38,500
then that all of the upcoming events

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:43,830
will be released there yeah they're all

00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:45,760
