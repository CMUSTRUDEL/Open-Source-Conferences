Title: Dwayne McDaniel: Learning Markdown: 20 minutes that will change your life
Publication date: 2019-09-06
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	Donâ€™t you wish there was a way to write content faster without having to log into your WordPress site? Turns out there is and it is called Markdown, which can be written in any text editor you choose. Based on the basics of HTML and with a goal of making marked up content as readable as possible, Markdown takes only minutes to learn and is the most transportable way you can write your content. Sites like GitHub, Bitbucket and Reddit already expect it and now WordPress does too.
Takeaways:
A working knowledge of how to notate plain text to be rendered as beautiful HTML
A Cheatsheet for everything else
Strategies for content curation a storage using Git

half a Pantheon but I don't have time to

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,809

room just as in a sense of like who saw

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,829
us on the schedule Mike I'm coming in

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,120
the room for that talk wow that's a good

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,440
number that's more than I expected for a

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,899
lightning talk session

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,399
who here is a full-time developer what

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,449
you do is develop awesome you're getting

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,480
a lot out of this talk who here's a

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,350
designer awesome during a lot let's talk

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,420
who's a content editor or writer okay

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,710
that's actually with this talk for so

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,710
everybody else bear with me

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,520
but this is a true story this is this is

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,100
I was doing a project management thing

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,869
inside of Pantheon and having a bad time

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,190
connected to YouTube apparently and I

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,320
would had these spreadsheets

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,030
spreadsheets but had the document that

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,880
laid out exactly the way I like to lay

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,159
out a document and then I pasted it into

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,039
Guttenberg and it looked like this I was

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,509
like what the okay that's not what I

00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:41,369
wrote because what I originally wrote

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,229
was this which you know it's it it's

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,259
indented it's you know laid out with

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,630
numbers there and you know ordered lists

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,369
I like numbered ordered lists and then

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,220
just it didn't know what to do with any

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,080
of that and that's just tragic

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,080
because there's this is a solved problem

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,729
because in my research for this someone

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,369
said that it's much more eloquently than

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,380
I ever could what I need is the

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,209
universal format that disallows my

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,569
content to be transported I want to

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,440
write once and transport everywhere and

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,900
turns out I'm the only person that

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
wanted this because we've had markdown

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,489
for quite a few years now and that's

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,560
what this talk is all about so if you go

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,940
to Wikipedia it says this and nothing

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,380
wrong there it's just that's a bunch of

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,510
words what does that really even mean

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,130
well hopefully by the end well we'll

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,570
suss that out maybe these guys I think

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,489
it's important to stop and remember that

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,390
all of the stuff we talked about wasn't

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,940
made by like them or another today by us

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,079
we're the open source community everyone

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,670
sitting here you've never touched code

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,010
in your life welcome you were part of

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,510
the movement that is open source and

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,040
these guys said to each other

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,329
hey there's got to be a better way to do

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,060
this thing we're doing that's that's

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,519
invent a structure that will let us

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,910
transform this notation into beautiful X

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,959
seeds XHTML or just HTML the guy on the

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,660
right Aaron went on to be credited as

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,420
founder of Reddit and the guy on the

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,850
Left John Gruber is still doing well but

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,620
there's other stuff with his life and

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,120
this is it this is pretty much the rest

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,010
of this talk we're going to explain what

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,630
the heck you're looking at here on the

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,040
right hand of my screen right side of

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,859
the screen up here

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,209
that's markdown that is the notation so

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,849
if you already got this and you know

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,680
what I'm talking about

00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,719
and go get coffee earlier whatever you

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,400
want otherwise we're gonna like pretty

00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,689
much walk through this and explain how

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,769
it got to be this thing on the right and

00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:37,069
then talk a little bit about Gutenberg

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,409
which is definitely associated with this

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,540
so markdown is already everywhere it's

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,969
on sites like as far as you know like

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,709
github who here goes ever seen a readme

00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:49,129
page on github they're like wow that is

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,359
not styled at all yeah there's a lot of

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,889
github readme pages like that

00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:54,849
whoever sees of getting me again hub

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,959
readme pages like that is gorgeous I

00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,049
honestly like gonna be PCL at one

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:05,019
speaking of WP CLI uh and if you go look

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:09,019
at the code on this thing what you see

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:12,049
well if I look at the raw like a little

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:17,030
bit bigger well we got this mix of these

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:21,139
weird terminologies and HTML because for

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,180
a lot of intents and purposes oh no

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,289
worries I'm off a little bit there okay

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,479
good to know

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:31,810
any thing I didn't justify all the stuff

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:34,639
to the right all right or to the left

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,039
but yeah it to the browser it doesn't

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,449
really care depending on what system

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,610
you're using but if you look it's like a

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,099
system that will interpret markdown it's

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,460
the same thing as interpreting HTML Zack

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:50,000
exchange they have that little thing

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,490
over there on the right that says how to

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,210
use the how to use markdown for their

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,789
site because this is a little bit

00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,930
different than what we saw here they'll

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,039
be a little different what we see here

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,500
and read it and it'd be a little bit

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,169
different than what we see in Gutenberg

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,810
welcome back to those that's because

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,580
markdown is not a language it's not like

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,880
PHP it's not like JavaScript there's no

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,630
official body that says this is markdown

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,270
use it this way or don't it's an idea

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,530
that a couple guys generated and said

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,570
would it be cool if we had the shorthand

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,849
notation and yes you can go to Darin

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,490
fireball that net which is where all of

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:30,830
the original code is that Gruber and

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,539
Aaron came up with that said how do you

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,880
extend it and what this you could do

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:36,680
with this formulation but important

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,210
thing to realize if you get into this

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
and like hey this doesn't work here the

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,199
same way it does over here

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,630
it might not how they interpreted that

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,770
might be a little bit different so know

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,020
where you're writing to know how they're

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,280
interpreting all of this but it's

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,410
everywhere on the internet once you

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,979
start once you see markdown you can't

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,750
unsee it and it's just how to how to

00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,680
write HTML really really fast including

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,190
if you're using this thing called

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,630
Gutenberg because Matt Mullenweg was

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,400
asked what's your favorite part of the

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,470
upcoming gutenberg release this is back

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,789
at wordcamp europe last year and he said

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,530
the fact you can copy-paste markdown

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,539
like but he didn't think about it that

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,360
was like the first thing he said because

00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,979
that's how powerful this is but but why

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,020
is this really powerful well we'll get

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,190
to that but let's actually get to what I

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,020
told you we're gonna do and that's Maury

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,100
markdown so if you have a computer in

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,510
front of you prepare to take some notes

00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,680
because that'll be your cheat sheet and

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,510
you'll never have to look up another

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,770
cheat sheet ever again if you're writing

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,710
things down actually you have a

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,270
beautiful set up there is that transfer

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,710
to anything electronically or you gotta

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,849
manually okay just a paper notebook

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,210
paper notebook is actually brilliant

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:41,300
right you you can write you can write

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,650
markdown in up on paper this is one of

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,630
the beautiful things about it but if you

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,550
want to like a fancy text editor that

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,900
will like do what I did in that previous

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,550
slide where I wrote my markdown on one

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,250
side and then I got the output on the

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,590
other side all these work and there's no

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,300
one winner here and if you're like I

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,830
don't want to download nothing go to

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,409
Dillinger dot IO and see if it works

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,030
today but stack edit dot IO is the same

00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,650
thing if there's just online versions of

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,699
this or you can just go type in one half

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,039
of the screen the other half screen

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,349
produces this beautiful HTML you can

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,060
actually copy paste anywhere or you

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,610
could just write wherever you got like I

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,949
write a lot in TextWrangler

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,199
yes outdated takes your text Wrangler I

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,970
love it because the way it works in fact

00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,710
this is the blog I'm Tate I'm writing

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,530
right now for this camp including all my

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,419
notes and I'm just throwing markdown as

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,360
I go and it's already gonna transform

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,169
for me when I'm done before we go any

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,789
farther before I lose anyone else does

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:36,560
everyone know what these things are

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,389
does this is this unfamiliar and there

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,000
is no shame whatsoever in the world to

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:45,710
say I'm not sure what that is what does

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,150
HTML thing is anybody you know that's

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,800
cool man because you guys start

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,270
somewhere the Internet is written in

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,759
this thing called HTML hypertext markup

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,900
language and

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,210
these are the common elements so if you

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,710
see something with like it's bigger at

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,000
the top that's probably cuz they used a

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,990
header and like italics and bold and

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,639
these are little symbols that if you

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,110
look at the code inspect element it'll

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,759
show you like how the page was built and

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,550
what those things actually mean if you

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,440
don't know HTML go under it code Academy

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,449
has a brilliant free class a lot of

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,100
things have free classes and it will

00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,410
make you a much better no matter what

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,530
you're doing will make a much better web

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,840
professional

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,070
to know HTML deeply because at the end

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,380
of the day that's all it is the

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,590
JavaScript and PHP are just rendering

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:31,160
HTML elements at the end of the day

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,450
that's all it really is headers so this

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,250
is how we actually do it now that you've

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,140
gotten your editor up and running or

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,849
piece of paper in front of you so

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,380
headers starting out with my favorite

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:45,290
piece one asterisks are not Asterix one

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,300
hash tag equals an h1 two hash tags

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:54,860
equals an h2 three hash tags equals a

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,600
four yeah four exactly or with h1s and

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,400
h2s there's this weird underline thing

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,410
that works in some markdown editors and

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:06,850
not others but it's the same idea why

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,100
why are headers important anybody

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,600
hierarchy but why is that important

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,470
accessibility that's the answer I love

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,240
the best which what SEO sure that I

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,220
would rush others focus on accessibility

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,339
and if we get SEO is a byproduct that's

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,230
amazing I've been the other way around

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,760
but yeah your pages should be laid out

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,190
semantically h1 should be followed by

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,560
h2s which should be followed by h3s and

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,790
so on and so forth make it easy for a

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,660
screen reader to pick up and see what

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,579
your pages if you ever want to be

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,470
horrified go to a pet like something you

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:40,370
wrote two years ago and then turn on a

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,360
screen reader horrifying but I'll make

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,950
you a better developer if you do that

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,980
you want to put italics on something

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,870
throw an underscore on either side oh I

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,240
forgot to mention the one earlier that I

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,170
don't have a slide for who here uses

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,399
slack yeah you that accepts markdown so

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,930
all of this stuff I'm showing you here

00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,459
is how you can stylize slack messages

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,110
their version of it again learn what

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,500
they how they actually implemented it

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,670
like they I love their underscore and

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,960
not underscore I love their strike

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,790
through as well but I don't have a slide

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,350
for that bold we won't make something

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,110
bold throw two asterisks on both sides

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,440
that's it that's the entire how you make

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,570
something bold so if you like opening

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,500
brackets and typing be you know do that

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,990
but you could also like bold italic

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,970
things just combine them and in all my

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,430
testing I've never been able to tell the

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,410
difference between putting the Asterix

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,360
on the outside of the underscore or the

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,830
inside as long as they're both there and

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,430
it's like it properly closes itself

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,430
you're fine

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,450
this is actually the most practical one

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,150
I have that I use a lot is ordered lists

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,940
and unordered lists I like lists it's

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,940
easy to organize information who's ever

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:57,230
tried to in Gutenberg create a nested

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,700
list three items deep did you succeed no

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,220
I don't know there's a way to succeed

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,900
with that tab messes everything up shift

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,270
tab causes other problems with my

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,600
machine I don't know it's just my

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,970
machine is just that's how I test on how

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,310
you do this in an markdown is if you

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,260
want it under lists asterisks the thing

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,170
Asterix the next thing Asterix the next

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,540
thing you want to do a nest in there tab

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,750
over one and keep doing the same thing

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,250
you wanted Teton Nest one more in there

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,780
another tab over you want to nest in

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,760
further another tab over if you want to

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,380
nest again another tab over you can nest

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,950
infinitely deep with ordered list not

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,560
that that's a great idea but you can

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:38,900
ordered Lister's just numbers 1.2.3.4

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,350
Everman you got same exact principle

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,330
works now this one you can't like change

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,980
up the styling you're just making an

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,330
ordered list you're not trying to say ok

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,250
if it's three nested in and we're using

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,720
Roman numerals but you'll have an

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,100
ordered list that you can throw styling

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,200
on later with depending on what your

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,510
actual presentation layers is gonna do

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,010
but creating the ordered list very quick

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:03,920
one two three links who likes opening

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,740
their angular brackets and saying a href

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,140
and then filling in the rest it's kind

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,140
of fun but no it's it's not

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,050
open closed square open closed

00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,860
parenthesis and that is how links work

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,850
fact here is the link for where we went

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,610
last night of speaker dinner archetype

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,889
brewing that's the link and that is the

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,360
words that is a link that will transform

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:32,429
into a magical link when I don't have to

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,869
touch a HRF ever again you can also do

00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:37,350
this other really cool thing that works

00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:40,230
kind of like footnoting so you can say

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,779
link our text and another square bracket

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,540
beside it to put a link to where that

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,649
link will actually end up going you can

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,730
do this with numbers it doesn't matter

00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,769
what text you put in there I just had

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,660
linked for a word but any text like the

00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,429
number one that down to the bottom and a

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,519
square bracket you have a one colon and

00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:58,170
then the address and so you can create

00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,119
documents that have hundreds of links

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,559
but you're managing all those links at

00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:03,689
the bottom of the document not actually

00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,300
going through the document itself like

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:09,179
in reading within peril paragraphs comes

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,829
in handy in certain situations images

00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,369
this is actually my favorite pieces

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:15,480
because it forces alt text it doesn't

00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:17,730
force you to fill in the blank

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,040
but it's screen like it's obvious you

00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,509
missed it

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,579
you just do the exact same formula that

00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:27,990
you do for a link it's just throw a bang

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:29,999
in front the exclamation mark and gives

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,970
you a link to an image that and then

00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:36,649
image unfurls in that first square

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,019
bracket that's your alt text that's it

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:44,100
so does anyone like completely lost is

00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:46,259
this like anybody know this is HTML if

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,389
you don't know HTML yep if you don't

00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,860
know HTML sure I get it this is you have

00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,980
to learn that basic this is a shorthand

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,959
for that but otherwise like black quotes

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,120
anybody I've actually use black coats in

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,129
their day-to-day like a handful of

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,389
people I I find it useful occasionally

00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,699
but just it's a greater than there's

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:10,019
that the less than it's a closed closed

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:13,170
angle bracket code oh this is the best

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,970
in slack throw back ticks back ticks is

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,379
right above your tilde or on the same

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,819
keys the tilde underneath the tilde so

00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,779
don't hit shift when he hit tilde and

00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:23,990
you get a back tick wrap a single two

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,110
back tick on either side of your

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,940
texts and that becomes code put three

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,860
back ticks in a row online and then

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,390
start a new line anything you put

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,150
between that and the next three in a row

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,220
back ticks become the code block very

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,900
very easy to do and in slack this will

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,370
save you a lot of headache say all right

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,470
this variables to start throwing back

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,780
texture on variable names or stiff it's

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,130
a code or file names and it'll pop out

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,480
on the screen and it'll be a little

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:53,600
easier to communicate there's a lot more

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,920
but it depends on what you are using and

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,690
what you're trying to do and what that

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,640
particular implementation wanted you to

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,920
do if you go to dairy and fireball and

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,010
look like the extensions they've built

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,080
there is full like graphing a text-based

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,270
graphing tools they've built in with

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,180
like very simple lines and like drawing

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,800
underscores under our underscores in the

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,960
right order you can make these beautiful

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,490
diagrams that just like magically make

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,530
themselves by just putting a couple

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,870
lines together logically that very

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,030
easily and human readable underline all

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,250
this it should be human readable there's

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:28,040
where we get to the Gutenberg so

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,800
Gutenberg accepts copy-paste markdown

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,440
and it just transforms it on right

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,300
that's how I make my blog and also

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,760
Gutenberg has this wonderful feature

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,040
that I have loved ever since I first

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,580
touched it that if you feed it a naked

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,560
URL that it knows what to do with it

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,020
just does the thing it's supposed to do

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,960
and form a block around it so I don't go

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,430
in and I never have ever actually hit

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,770
make a new Guttenberg block for YouTube

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,450
or Twitter and then threw in the URL I

00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,040
just feed it a naked URL and it's like I

00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:02,060
know what to do with this okay that's

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,000
good which means I can take this very

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,340
simple just a bunch of text on a screen

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,620
and turn it into this which is a demo

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,990
post tab I think this is on my site if

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,640
you go look at any my site post on my

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:18,290
site this is how they were almost all

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,810
created I'm gonna speed through this

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,580
very last part but I keep saying it's

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,320
copy paste and it is and if you like

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,920
copy pasting things go for it it's

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,410
awesome I don't like copy paste because

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,510
it's manual when I first need this talk

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,370
to advertise it this way because I told

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,390
them in a conversation like I do it

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,150
because I don't blog on my wordpress

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,800
site anymore

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,690
and they advertise that so I'd like

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,820
write the rest of the slides to justify

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,550
that but it's true I don't want to log

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,860
them out of wp-admin ever again because

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,060
I love the WP CLI it lets me do

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,300
everything I need to do almost

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,850
everything I need to do like 99% of it

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,880
because you can do this this is mind

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,100
blowing Lee amazing and I'm not sure why

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,529
everyone not doesn't use this to push

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,960
content around WPC light lets you move

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,339
content around from point A to point B

00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,990
it doesn't matter what point a and point

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,990
B are which means if you want to like

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,360
update content on a server that actually

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,670
taking orders you can build new content

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,709
off of a staging server without ever

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,720
touching the database directly do it the

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,910
proper WordPress way that's very safe

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,620
and you'll never blow up your database

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,910
so I started doing this and I build a

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,949
proof of concept around this and this is

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,199
actually how I make my posts is this is

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,080
I could this is the actual WPC I command

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,580
how to make this this post happen pretty

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,280
complicated so I built the tool to help

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,740
me do that

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,809
it leverages the W markdown plug-in so

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,309
it will actually transform on rate when

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,240
you push things in instead of copy paste

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,590
you know we'll just say all right I

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,390
accept this file in and I will just

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,550
transform it into markdown for you now I

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,170
love that and I test along the way so

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,900
this is really complicated enough time

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,840
to like get into it here but I actually

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,940
write everything locally like here store

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,130
it on github throw it against the dev

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,450
server B hat tests on the dev server to

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,070
make sure everything worked the way I

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,809
thought it would if that all passes I

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,130
ship it to my test server then I visual

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:07,380
regression test to make sure nothing

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,880
broke upon transport from server to test

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,559
and if that all works I pushed into

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,270
production now that sounds overly

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,630
complicated to publish a blog you're

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,000
probably right but this saves me hours a

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,410
month I'm not kidding like this saves me

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,179
about an hour every time I post a blog

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,530
because I make a lot of mistakes and B

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,720
hat catching my mistakes is way easier

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,800
to fix let me fix it in my hand but

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,090
that's all based on this idea of

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,400
markdown if I didn't have this hyper

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,010
transportable way to do a thing none of

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,630
this would be possible and once you

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,000
start seeing it it's like regex you'll

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,710
see it everywhere you'll it's just

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,720
everywhere in the code it's everywhere

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,980
in Martin and github and you can go to

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,059
my github and get the code for the thing

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,000
I just talked about if you really want

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,740
to post it now this is an example proof

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,170
of concept but feel free to use if you

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,330
want I'm not supporting you

00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,980
truth and there's the rest of the things

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,660
and there's a lot there's a ton of cheat

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,430
sheets and tutorials out there find what

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,050
works for you but seriously it'll take

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,370
you 20 minutes to sit down and like I'm

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,440
gonna learn this and then you'll never

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,630
go back it's so much faster right this

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:12,949
way so thanks everybody

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:12,949
