maximizing your freelancer day and the

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,289
best way to figure out what you could

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,500
speak about on work camp is find

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,150
something that you struggle with and

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,630
figure out a way to solve that problem

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,660
and then teach others so this is what I

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,070
came up with tell you a little bit about

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,540
myself very quickly I've been a

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,579
freelancer since 2010 I am the co-owner

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,390
of Adcock create a group with my husband

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,730
who's right here I've been developing

00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:51,500
websites since the late 90s I've been

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,350
using WordPress since around 2010

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,469
exclusively since 2011 and I live in

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,940
Newnan Georgia so and there is my email

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,080
address which will also be at the end

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,780
what we're going to cover in this

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,810
extremely fire hose of information in

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,880
the 20 minutes that we have is

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,729
recommended reading taming your inbox no

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,090
isn't a rejection tracking your

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,040
productivity so you know that number one

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,439
where you are now and that you're

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
getting better have a process for

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,460
everything which is a whole talk by

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,860
itself and some project management tools

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,460
recommended reading getting things done

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,259
by David Allen number one on the list

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,549
for a reason

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:46,470
okay take the stairs by Rory Vaden

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:50,430
procrastinate on purpose same author

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,060
Rory Vaden everybody writes by Ann

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,729
Handley and I'm a I love checklist so

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,439
the checklist manifesto I could actually

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,979
have an hour-long conversation with you

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,159
just on that book alone

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:08,440
okay taming your inbox unsubscribe

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,940
you're not they don't take it personally

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,670
just get rid of the stuff that you don't

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:16,000
really look at okay get it out of your

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,560
inbox use a third-party tool if you

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,200
don't want to like necessarily always

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,590
get rid of it totally like I like

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,540
coupons I just want to see them unless I

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:32,980
want them so I use unrolling to put all

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,450
my promotional emails in out of my inbox

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,030
they actually go into a folder in my

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,040
inbox because I use air mail free and I

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,150
can go there and get my coupons what I

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,269
want them but I don't have to see all

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,849
those emails coming in every day this is

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,819
from David Allen's get getting things

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,970
done when you get an email you do one of

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,950
four things you delegate it you give it

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,310
to your virtual assistant you send it to

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,160
your project management tool you defer

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,910
it oh I'm gonna do that later send it to

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,019
Trello I'm going to delete it because

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,680
just delete it don't leave it in your

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,079
Inbox

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,450
taking up room just get rid of it or you

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,880
do it right then and he says if it takes

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,819
less than two minutes to do do it right

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,019
then I kind of flexing if it takes less

00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,590
than five minutes I'm probably gonna

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:25,420
stop and do it then otherwise it goes to

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:27,880
my project management tool set up a way

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,370
to send from your inbox to your project

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,769
management tool get it out of there get

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,310
it out of your head and get it somewhere

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,010
else

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,959
don't worry don't spin or waste your

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,359
mental energy trying to remember things

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,940
to do if you get it out of your head get

00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,340
it out of your inbox your things aren't

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,010
gonna fall through the cracks set a

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,049
schedule to check email and then turn it

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,660
off okay this is like the hardest thing

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:55,660
in the world for me to do still I check

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,480
my email first thing in the morning then

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,970
I quit it I don't I don't look at my

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
phone I work for a few hours then I'll

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,069
open it back up again and check it

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
I actually schedule it and yes I cheat

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,030
sometimes but every time I find myself

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,549
chasing squirrels it's because of my

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,440
inbox and I turn it off turn off the

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,380
indication of how many emails are

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,640
showing up you can do that so it doesn't

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,900
say 3070

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,880
because that'll just drive you insane

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,890
and then you're gonna open it up to see

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,960
what those 37 emails are there's

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,570
probably one valuable email in there and

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,490
the rest is junk so just turn off the

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,170
little indicators and there's there's a

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,840
link here and there's links to slides at

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,600
the end on email hats and there's some

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,950
great ones in this resource I found

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,140
online okay

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,840
track your productivity know where

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,840
you're spending your time I use rescue

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,310
time love it takes a couple weeks for it

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,710
to learn what you're doing and you have

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,300
to tell it well this is not wasting my

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,840
time on the internet this is actually

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,970
research this is actually communication

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,800
time when I'm talking to clients on

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,900
zoom' so it you've actually go in there

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,550
and categorize it so I did that for the

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,110
first couple weeks and every once in a

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,360
while I'll go in and tweak it again and

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,050
it gives me a productivity score now

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,120
because I'm like data-driven and I like

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,440
to know how well I'm doing and I love

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,530
you know I was the person that loved to

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,010
get their report card so I want to know

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,100
how I'm doing if I'm below 80 percent

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,850
productivity I consider that week a

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,540
failure so I am like driven to make sure

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,570
that that I'm productive at least eighty

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,780
percent of the time toggle is another

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,680
good one I threw in focus at will and

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,910
brain FM because they actually have

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,220
music that you can put in your

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,940
headphones and it helps you be more

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,380
productive it stops the you know the

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,680
sounds in your house you know when you

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,360
have the cat fight downstairs or just

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,130
anything that's going to interrupt you

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,710
the guy with the lawn mower mowing your

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,930
lawn I wear those noise cancelling

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,510
headphones and when I'm depth of my most

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,630
productive time I actually have brain FL

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,340
on so I can pick concentration music and

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,650
it plays music that helps you

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:22,380
concentrate headphones help earbuds help

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,990
have a process for everything this is

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,950
what I learned from WP elevation and

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,889
from my business coach Nathan Ingram is

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:35,520
have a checklist for everything and

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,979
use them and check things off for your

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,599
incoming what everything you do when you

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,969
have a prospective client have a

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,340
checklist for that for your client

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,469
interview I actually have a checklist of

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,509
the things I'm going to ask I actually

00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:51,120
have a list of questionnaires of things

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,509
I'm going to ask them so I don't forget

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,979
I don't want to depend on my memory

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,189
proposal everything that I do in a

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,349
proposal have a checklist design I

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,930
actually have a Trello checklist for

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:06,060
design I have a cello Trello checklist

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,270
for development I have one for

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,110
pre-launch and at launch and post launch

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,659
and so the post mortem make sure that I

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,969
actually know what I need to do after a

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:21,360
website launches I don't want to depend

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,340
on my memory because it's just not going

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,509
to something's going to fall through the

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,210
cracks always take the time to document

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,580
your processes this was the hardest

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,020
thing for me to actually do it and now

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,789
every time I do something new there's a

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,520
loom you can record your screen with a

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,560
loom so every time I do something that

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,680
my virtual assistant hasn't done yet I

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,050
record it and that way now when I go on

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,639
vacation next week she's going to be

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,009
doing everything if she hasn't done I

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,409
can just throw it into Trello for her

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,469
and say I want you to update this on the

00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:00,779
website here's how to do it so I've been

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:04,020
slowly teaching her everything that I do

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:07,680
so she can take over the majority of the

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,740
daily tasks create checklist of your

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,750
processes great create a development or

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,240
stack of themes so this is one of the

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,060
things I do I have used WP engine so I

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,490
actually have it installed on WP engine

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,979
called base install and it has all my

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,370
plugins that I use almost all the sites

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,409
I use either generate press or Astra for

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,569
my theme so it's got both of them

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,550
installed on there has everything I need

00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,979
to start a website and I just have to

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:38,399
copy it and create a development website

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:41,039
takes about two minutes for WP engine to

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,560
spin that install up with everything I

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,680
need to start a project I also have that

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,050
same set up

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,760
local using desktop server so if I'm

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,890
going to actually do development on my

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,260
liquid web server I can pull out a

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,810
backup buddy backup throw that up there

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,420
I have everything ready saves you a

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,220
couple hours you don't have to worry

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,750
that much about licensing some of them

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,230
you have to put them in on every site

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,300
but it saves you a ton of time keep a

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,880
list of all your serial numbers and keys

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,940
for quick access mine's in a Google Doc

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,040
it's also in my my address book but then

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,899
you have to switch to everyone but I

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,089
actually have a list a Google Doc that I

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,430
just bring up boom boom boom fill out

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:25,060
all the licenses and I'm done I use

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:28,140
managed WP but there's main WP I think

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,910
sync there's all these different web

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,959
dashboards so you can access all of your

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,310
client sites from one place it saves you

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,230
a ton of time you don't have to know you

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,940
username password just boom boom boom

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,230
you're in and out of websites and

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,070
updating project management tools

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,580
everybody's got a different kind of

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,890
learning best practice some people learn

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,400
by listening some by watching somebody

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:58,060
doing you have to find a tool that works

00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,550
with the way you think and I've tried a

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,550
bunch of these some didn't work for me

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,580
like asana it looks nice

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:09,130
drove me crazy couldn't handle it I want

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,440
to see the whole thing in a big picture

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,430
so I use Trello because I can see my

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,230
whole week at a glance I can see you

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,860
know Monday Tuesday I can move things

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,459
around

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,540
I love Trello so I've tried Basecamp I

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,240
didn't like that one either

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,990
there's Monday there's Pluto de Szabo

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,880
pancake there's a gazillion you have to

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,370
try and use the free trial try them out

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,529
find one that works it the way you like

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,810
to work and the way you think but you've

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,790
got to use something to manage your

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,459
projects if you're doing one project at

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,480
a time that's fine but once you get two

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:48,700
or three or four it starts to become

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,220
unmanageable and things fall through the

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:56,410
cracks okay there's more these are some

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,370
great tools to look at better proposals

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,290
for writing proposals

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,180
TextExpander my new favorite thing in

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:06,570
the world you've never heard of it

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,430
you can type little key codes and you

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,160
can set your own little codes and it

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,350
will expand the text so for instance

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,649
when we came up with our business name

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,120
Adcock creative group in hindsight I

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,029
would have liked something that was

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,490
really short because typing out Adcock

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:30,029
Melanie at Adcock creative group now I

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:33,660
type out period AC G I just type a CG it

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:36,480
expands puts my email address in there

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,040
or it's my whole email address in I even

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,930
do that with some of my client stuff

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,430
when I have to keep repeating the same

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,730
things over again I just create a little

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,290
snippet in Texas pander and boom that's

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,570
how you're when you're on chat support

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,709
and they keep they just do something and

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,630
all of a sudden you get this paragraph

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:55,800
from them they're using something like

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:59,520
text expander BLISK IO mobile responsive

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,080
testing for websites excellent it's a

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,120
like a little Chrome browser that allows

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,980
you to test on phones and tablets it

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,329
shows you what it looks like

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:13,079
Koda or transmit for FTP and editing

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:16,680

the wall you're not solving the problem

yes I use Trello and by what I do is I

00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:29,819
actually have a sample website Trello

00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:33,109
board set up that has information design

00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:37,589
has just general information design

00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:40,499
development pre-launch launch and post

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,869
launch columns and then the cards go and

00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,639
I create a board for each project I

00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:47,399
invite my clients in so they can see

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,859
where we are and what we've done if it's

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,919
a small site we all do a card for each

00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:55,109
page and we can they can see what's done

00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,709
and then they can check off on it and

00:13:55,109 --> 00:14:01,079
make sure I have one for a month that

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,359
just says incoming Monday Tuesday

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,889
Wednesday Thursday Friday and then I

00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:08,959
have a weekend one I actually my

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:15,629
shopping list on Trello there as well

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:17,850
yeah I have them all created on Trello

00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,009
so I can copy them from one board to

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,999
another so I have a development

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:26,850
checklist until when I go to a new thing

00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,470
I just boom I have my development or if

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,759
I want my VA to optimize the site using

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,069
hummingbird here's the checklist for

00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,279
hummingbird I have am all set and I keep

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:40,939
tweaking them and adding as I go along

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,939
yes

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,960
better times a day for productivity

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,790
that's gonna be a personal thing I

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,480
actually thought my most productive time

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:01,570
was in the morning but because of email

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,150
and you know putting out fires and phone

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,370
calls and stuff my most productive time

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,920
is actually in the afternoon which I

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,900
thought was my worst but courting rescue

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,790
time it's what I get done them I spend

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,950
more time working on websites in the

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,950
afternoon than I do in the morning which

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,960
was shocking to me so what you think

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,780
you're being productive about being

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,000
productive at all it's a great eye

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,860
opener on you get to see where you're

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,810
spending or where you're wasting your

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,810
time thank you very much

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,169
