well

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:15,570
who here has a responsibility for

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:21,340
creating any kind of content

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,230
okay who loves that responsibility okay

00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,869
well we've got a few freaks in the room

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,080
thank you for joining us today no just

00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:31,750
kidding I love writing I just don't

00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,470
necessarily love writing what about

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:38,380
somebody else's thing on a deadline that

00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:44,140
may or may not be convenient to me right

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:47,019
so this having a content calendar can

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,329
really help you kind of overcome some of

00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:53,079
the burnout that can happen from having

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:55,690
to have content on a regular basis I

00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,690
think content burnout is probably one of

00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:03,609
the key factors that contributes to

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:07,870
failure when it comes to engaging your

00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:10,360
visitors SEO conversions I don't know

00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,480
about you but I kind of get worn out of

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,930
having to be creative on a dime all the

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,640
time

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,340
so let's think about all the different

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,840
types of content that we have to create

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:26,189
what kind of content do you have to

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:34,649
create social media posts what else

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:34,649
blogs LinkedIn emails videos podcasts

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:45,189
newsletters pages what else

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:49,619
photos what oh how about meta

00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:52,479
description like content content content

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,149
but one of the most wonderful things

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,409
about content is everything it can do

00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:00,670
for us if it's made easy speaking of

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,189
easy SiteGround

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,960
makes it easy for me to travel I'm a

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:08,020
site ground community ambassador and

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,060
they help sponsor my travel to come and

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:15,160
help participate at wordcamp so I just

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,960
want to thank them the content is king

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,530
we hear this all the time we don't hear

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,240
SEO is king video is king where content

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,340
is came because content drives

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,740
everything else right if we don't have

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,240
good content we can't be effective in

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,320
these other

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,150
Avenues so we just talked a little bit

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,270
about all the different types of content

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,730
we produce and it can be a little

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,000
overwhelming if you don't have a

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,700
framework so one of the things i want to

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,850
talk about is the framework of content

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,290
on our websites to start off with so has

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,540
anyone ever heard of content clusters

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,730
yeah okay so I first kind of I mean I

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,840
had vaguely had an idea about how

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,590
content structure on a website should

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,320
work but I went to I'm sound board a

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,120
couple of years ago it's this conference

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,790
in Athens digital marketing conference

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,060
and there was a guy from HubSpot there

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,660
and he they explained or this guy

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,850
explained about how the optimal site

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,790
architecture for a website should work

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,420
okay and they did a lot of hard lifting

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,310
on white papers and studies and all to

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,840
see what's the optimal site structure

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,640
for bringing in the most amount of

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,510
traffic and this is what they came up

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,390
with so site content clusters are a way

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,420
of organizing your information to have

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,660
your most important ideas on one

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,960
authoritative post or page one content

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,080
piece and then having a smaller pieces

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,510
that support that linking to it so this

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,340
would be your large content piece and

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,760
this would be the smaller pieces that

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,770
link to it and maybe it's a blog post or

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,570
a video or you know the different types

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,030
of content that you could have that

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,140
would link to that so that would be your

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:13,240
ideal structure and you know how you how

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,299
you break those up and categorize those

00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,870
it might be your categories right so

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,850
let's say for myself I'm a web designer

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,770
digital marketer so but I have a bunch

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,500
of different services we do SEO we do

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,990
web design we do social media so maybe

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,300
the way that I organize my content might

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,980
be you know one at one of these would be

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,470
web design and then all of these would

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:40,960
be the pieces of content that support

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:44,150
web design right so

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,970
how do you create all these pieces of

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,139
content that you need to support a

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,030
system like that

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,470
every one of those little pieces would

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,020
be a piece of content that's a lot of

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:58,729
content right and it can seem really

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:05,630
overwhelming so how I like to do this is

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:09,349
by themes so I like to do I kind of like

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:13,009
to hold on to this these monthly themes

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:14,900
that are through WP elevation so I'm in

00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,520
WP elevation and one of the things that

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,979
they do is they pump out a ton of

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,770
content and they break their content

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,389
into themes and monthly themes grow one

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,630
month it might be grows in the next

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,430
month elevate then profit sprint and

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,400
then they kind of everything kind of

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,080
goes on that theme well I don't want to

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:39,080
just copy what they do I want to kind of

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,210
season it to taste so I also want it to

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,740
be personally relevant to me because if

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,139
I'm gonna do the writing or if I'm going

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,740
to be managing this content I want it to

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:51,050
kind of be interesting to me so I kind

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,550
of made a list of all the things that I

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:58,699
was kind of working on personally and

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,830
I'm more of a list of flaws and an

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,699
actual person so here's all the things

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,800
that I'm working on in myself so you can

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:10,250
see I'm a little bit of a hot mess

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,150
but I'm working on it so to make things

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:16,940
interesting for me I paired what the

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,889
month was that WP elevation was doing

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,479
because then what I'm writing about is

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,000
also relevant to what they're writing

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,590
about and what my other peers who are in

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,449
there who are also following this

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,780
framework are also writing about and

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,690
then we can share each other's content

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:37,400
and it's kind of similar right so I'm

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,080
gonna pair the Sprint month with and

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,800
sprints kind of like catching up tying

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,630
up loose ends with what I chose to work

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,250
on which is emotional management right

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,199
because I'm a little bit of a roller

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,300
coaster I need to manage that so I'm

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,680
just kind of putting that in my pot and

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,860
simmering it

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,070
so the theme for the month for this

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,570
would be for me the middle miles and so

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,970
I don't know if you've ever heard of the

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,400
middle miles middle miles are kind of

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,080
like when you first start out on a big

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,300
project and you've got a lot of

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,039
excitement and you've got a lot of left

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,919
and you're just really gung-ho and you

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,600
keep going and then eventually you kind

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,960
of lose a little bit of that enthusiasm

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,300
and you know start to plateau a little

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,509
bit things start to get a little bit

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,500
boring a bit more of a grind those are

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:33,479
the middle miles okay so that's kind of

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,680
what I wanted this theme to be so how

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,160
are we gonna talk about that how are we

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,280
gonna create a Content plan around the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,530
middle miles okay so these are my

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,080
content starters this is kind of how I

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,479
when I'm plotting out like a month's

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,120
content on like let's just say a weekly

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,820
basis and I do want to put a disclaimer

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
here I'm really although I'm standing in

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,419
front of you I'm talking to myself

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,810
because one of the things that I try to

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,240
do is where I'm lacking I need to really

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,630
learn to teach that so I don't want to

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,449
say my paragon of virtue in this area

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:13,710
but I am figuring it out so I start off

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:16,080
with what is the theme so what are the

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,840
startup middle miles let's talk about it

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,090
what does it look like what is it what

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,820
causes it how like what are the things

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:27,380
that precede it what come after it right

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:32,070
what is it and that may be one topic

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:35,940
then we have why let's talk about why

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,979
are these middle miles so tricky okay so

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:45,720
then we just kind of that we plot that

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:47,550
out then we have maybe a how-to so

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,950
there's different ways you can have how

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,470
to use they could be a webinar it could

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,740
be an infographic I really like

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,690
infographics so let's go back and look

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,720
at our content starters again so we just

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:04,730
have this list and we just go down the

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,730
list spend about 10 minutes

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:13,580
so what why how to you who not how uh

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,960
who not how would be if I if my clients

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,010
were going to come to me and they

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,580
weren't going to figure this out

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,960
themselves how could I help them or if I

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,120
wanted help with this who would I go to

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,780
engage maybe interview a strategic

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,140
partner maybe talk to my clients and do

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,450
some really some fat finding a personal

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,120
insight or an opposite view that's

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:42,620
really great for like being provocative

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,920
right and listicles and roundups so

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,440
we've got the what we have the why we

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,120
have a how to write so maybe we have a

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,860
whole infographic it's just another

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,810
little cartoons of how they're surviving

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:59,060
the middle miles engaging their

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,940
community so SiteGround is really good

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,800
about this they periodically will pull

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,020
their ambassadors about something and

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,230
get us providing content for them so

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,150
they're kind of taking us and you know

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,850
having us fill those content holes for

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,370
them so maybe if I'm talking about the

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,340
middle miles maybe the question is I'm

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,410
polling my friends or polling you know

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,990
maybe some of my clients so how did you

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,870
survive the emotional drain that comes

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,080
in the middle miles right and have them

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,390
create this content for you but also

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,150
it's doing double-duty because now

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,040
you're getting to know your clients a

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,720
little bit better or maybe you're

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,510
getting to know your strategic partners

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:48,950
a little bit better and everybody loves

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:50,000
to be included personal rants so this is

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,670
where you want to be a little bit

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,110
provocative right maybe the middle miles

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,360
are the time when you should be giving

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,160
up that's not what you're expecting to

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,580
hear right you're safe never give up

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,170
never surrender well maybe maybe it is

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,540
time to give up maybe you're struggling

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,290
through the middle miles or something

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,580
that's not really your calling okay but

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,880
this would be something be great for

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,620
like an email list to send out you know

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,720
sent as an email bless it that's going

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,670
to be a subject line if somebody send me

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,200
emails like is it time for you to get

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:31,790
I'd be like how'd you know but I might

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:37,610
open it right and another way to to

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:39,950
start engaging your your your community

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,660
is to maybe get a listicle so 10

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,870
founders share their tips for surviving

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,140
the middle miles so here's something

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,029
that's really fun and really easy so

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:54,050
everybody loves to see their own face

00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:58,870
and to see their own name right well

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:02,450
what if you polled 10 clients of yours

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,029
you got their picture you took their

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,810
quote and their picture and you put them

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:12,620
on social media and tagged them who do

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,660
you think is gonna share that you think

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,830
they're gonna yeah they're gonna not oh

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,460
cuz you kind of made them look like a

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,220
big shot

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,010
right so you're going to put them a

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,140
position to look really good that you

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,050
can now take advantage of that

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,390
so now you've done that ten times not

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,120
only do you have a blog post but you've

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,080
got ten social media posts that you can

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,290
use and link back to that blog post is

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,210
to start promoted and then that piece of

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:48,589
content links to your main piece of

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:56,630
content so now that we have all these

00:12:48,589 --> 00:13:00,339
pieces of content I know to emphasize my

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,800
point can I get some Lightning now okay

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,480
so we talked about your your content

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,700
clusters right so that main piece of

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,410
content that's what we're calling a

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,600
pillar post because it's your

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,080
authoritative piece of content talking

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,100
about that subject right so we're going

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:22,160
to take all those pieces and we're going

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,690
to combine them into one long piece of

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,930
content okay

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,300
so most people when they start to attack

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,160
this they do the pillar post first and

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,990
then they create little pieces of

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,840
content to link to it

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:39,110
but to me that seems very overwhelming

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,080
and just exhausting think about it

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,970
right I don't know that I have the

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,370
exhaustive take on anything but if I

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,900
take all of those pieces of content that

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:57,320
we just created so the what the why the

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,360
Hat the who not how the list if we

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,940
combine it we could route back our way

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,400
back into a really great piece of

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,220
content so we just did one piece at a

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,340
time and now we're going to take all of

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,500
those and put them all together into one

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,320
piece of content and now we're linking

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:22,660
back but we still have that one piece of

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,660
content to start ranking yes

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:35,649
no you you've already yeah yep

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:40,129
so maybe week one you did what what is

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:42,980
web design what is email marketing right

00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:45,319
then the second week was so let's just

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,990
say take email marketing second week is

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:54,579
why is email marketing important okay

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,579
third week let's just say that is how to

00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:00,980
fifteen ways to create a great email

00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:03,439
marketing campaign right so we're making

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,480
each week we're gonna make this nice

00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:08,029
little piece of content and then we're

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,180
done we're gonna assemble all of those

00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:15,170
pieces into a really authoritative nice

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,879
long piece of content right so maybe we

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,709
can in that piece of content we've got

00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,230
lists we've got images we have an

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:24,019
infographic we have quotes we have and

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,579
if you had to start off and make this

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:28,220
really great piece of content that would

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,350
be incredibly overwhelming but if you

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,749
take it a little bit at a time and then

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,970
assemble it all together you can

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:37,879
actually just hand all that content off

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,079
to probably a Content writer or via and

00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:46,029
just say hey can you create me a nice

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:46,029
piece of content out of this right okay

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:55,680
exactly so the idea yes

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,940
so the idea and and I'm a little lemon

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,250
little hamstrung here because I don't

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,010
have my my spreadsheet out I can show

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,170
you here but the idea is to like do this

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,360
every month right so have a theme every

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,790
single month and then go through these

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,710
content starters get your topspin like

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,080
10 minutes I mean it really in fact

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,000
we'll do this here in just a minute but

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,210
it doesn't take that long to get all

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,580
your topics done right and then have it

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,530
planned out and maybe maybe you don't

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,050
even write them yourself maybe you hire

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,390
somebody else to do that right but you

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,060
gotta at least create the plan because

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,320
you can't hire out the planning unless

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,370
you really have a good idea of where

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:40,050
you're going so all right so let's let's

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,950
review that so is does anybody have a

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:50,300
burning desire to create some content

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:53,850
come on all right

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,250
so what's your name Adam I'm April nice

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,410
to meet you nice firm handshake okay so

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,900
what kind of business are you in content

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,120
writer content writer fantastic

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:08,730
how many too many different services do

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:12,480
you offer okay so let's let's do most

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,880
email letters okay I also do some

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,970
project management and I assist people

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,380
in getting manuscript started Oh

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,520
fantastic okay which one's the most

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,470
profitable for you right now actually

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,839
starting managers helping people get

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,220
their get their feet wet okay so let's

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,790
start with that because that might be

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:37,350
interesting okay so what is the benefit

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,730
that service provides people getting out

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,620
of their own way giving them an

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,060
opportunity to get started on something

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,070
that they've been dreaming about doing

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,530
okay so you're helping them achieve a

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,850
goal but when so let's have a let's just

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,350
say they've got a manuscript they

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,920
publish the book what does that do for

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,080
them a lot of times it takes their

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,830
business and puts it to another Plateau

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,480
okay opportunity to begin selling their

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,920
content

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,470
they're from the from their own

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,850
perspective okay the text from the book

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,600
point of view its building their

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,130
authority right it's it's probably what

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,370
we've heard that it's the best business

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,010
card you can have is a book right okay

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:19,790
so let's let's start there so we guys

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,800
what so our theme let's just say we're

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,960
you know we have a micro theme but we're

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,330
gonna kind of skip that just just to

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,900
jump to these content stars okay so what

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,610
would be manuscript writing okay right

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,970
would that would is that this or how you

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,860
would say okay so what is that service

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,110
can you kind of explain what that

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,060
service looks like a lot of its

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:45,110
interview base where we're talking

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,840
through outline creation either through

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:51,710
literally an outline or infographics and

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:55,130
creating web design for that web as in

00:18:51,710 --> 00:19:00,170
web but mind mapping and doing a lot of

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:02,870
brainstorming and then exploring

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,300
character if it's a novel exploring plot

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,260
boring theme exploring the different

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,000
components that they're going to be

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,160
using to end up with a final product

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,870
okay so all those things right there

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,260
that's a lot of information you could

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:17,830
turn into a blog post yes okay so why is

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,880
that important why would be why would

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,660
hiring somebody to do this why would

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,940
that be important to you to be the one

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,680
hired or the one to be the what so if I

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,450
needed to hire somebody why would that

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,880
be important to me to actually hire

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,430
somebody to get it done like why what

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:41,360
why shouldn't I do it myself

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:43,640
oftentimes people who are at that and

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,170
this is above and beyond that they're

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,090
managing time issues is kind of a thing

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,680
oftentimes it's because there's a fear

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,980
of that white page where there's nothing

00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,410
on it

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,100
and they came you know consumers or

00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:00,790
customers can't get the words out right

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:04,370
so it's time management and the

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,010
incapacitating fear of writing okay so

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:11,450
that's a great piece of content right

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:13,170
okay so could you think could you think

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,560
of a way to break that

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,420
process down okay so that what could you

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,810
create an infographic that can walk

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:25,410
people through that process right okay

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:28,260
who not how do you specifically help

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,020
people with this what is your process of

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,670
getting people started for that first

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,770
thing I do is I give them a choice of a

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,190
three by five card pack of 100 cards or

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,600
a hundred cards with four by six choose

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,970
which one you want and they usually

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,510
choose the four by six and then we just

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,180
start laying out actual physical pieces

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,650
rather than we get off the technology

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,110
we're sitting at a big table and we're

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,640
just starting flattening I don't know

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,710
about you guys but I'd love to see that

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,970
video

00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:02,880
wouldn't you right yes Yeah right right

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,550
so yeah that I mean that could just be

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,100
this huh that's a great idea it is a

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,990
great idea okay so now we're Network now

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,870
we're going we're gonna engage somebody

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,910
maybe who could you interview maybe a

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:19,430
former client who you've done this for

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,430
to talk about how it impacted their life

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,410
testimony it could be a video that you

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,230
can transcribed and got a podcast I mean

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,060
there's just you can just take it and

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,880
break it apart yeah that's great okay so

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,860
let's talk about a personal insight or a

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
rant let's do an opposite view okay so

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:53,040
why would you not want to write a book

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:59,220
who should not be doing that okay people

00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:02,220
who people who maybe they don't have a

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,900
clear message I don't know what they're

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,240
gonna say they're due they haven't put

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,570
any time into thinking about what

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,640
they're trying to achieve yeah maybe

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:15,360
maybe you shouldn't be writing a book

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,330
maybe that's the line and then you go

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,340
bond go down and list out all the

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,070
reasons why you shouldn't be writing a

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,910
book and how you can change those and

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:40,690
how you can help them change that

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:45,380
that's a very good way what's that okay

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:52,850
so how about a listicle or roundup

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:56,030
so maybe who of the last year what are

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,580
the top ten business books that give the

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,550
most impactful business books that came

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:10,550
out and you know can you pull a quote

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:12,380
out of there okay yeah she's got a lot

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,490
of following from what I understand

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,510
people who are trying to get their

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:23,300
businesses started

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:24,560
interesting now there you go anyway a

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,730
lot of people read those to get

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,890
motivated to get going

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,590
okay so what if he did a profile or a

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,420
spotlight on her as an author and the

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,430
different the impacts that she's had and

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,250
maybe people talking about like what

00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,560
they got out of that book okay and that

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,420
would be a great social media post a

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,820
little I mean you could link back and

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,400
then let's take let's look at this so

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,040
now all these pieces of content look at

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,170
all the different varied pieces that

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,420
you're that you've now had have you've

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:57,280
written these all out now you could come

00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:00,590
compile these into one giant pillar

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,650
authoritative page right the ultimate

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,490
guide to or you know everything you need

to know about why you need a manuscript

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:12,650
right so you've got a video you've got

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,810
lists you've got bullet points you've

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,150
got an infographic you've got a

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,700
definitive statement about why you need

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,640
that what it is why you need it and how

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,350
you can help them with that it's pretty

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,050

think you should if you don't know what

keywords to target maybe you need to

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,540
take a step back and really start

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:49,480
thinking about who your audience is and

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,670
what they are asking for you know from

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,620
you what are they searching for that you

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,300

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,670
