things that I've learned and speaking is

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,800
that you should never start a talk with

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,870
an apology but I actually need to issue

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,460
an apology early so I'm gonna start by

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,130
telling you a joke and then come back to

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,279
the apology so why did the junior

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,199
software developer quit his job because

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,560
after two years of work he still didn't

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,560
get a raise

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,450
tough tough room

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:35,010
alright let's play this so these slides

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,110
hopefully are gonna auto play for you

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,710
guys so I went on a two-year road trip

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,600
in an RV

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,480
and I worked remotely the entire time

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,129
and I took a ton of pictures and so the

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,129
apology is that if you're friends with

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,629
me like and family or you follow me on

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,760
Twitter and you've never seen any of

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,789
these pictures it's because I suck at

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,350
social sharing so these are like some of

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,289
the best pictures and highlights from

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,550
our two-year trip we went all around the

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,620
country we went up the East Coast

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,539
actually started in Nashville that was

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,070
kind of where we kicked off our trip I

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,920
came here a couple years ago did a talk

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,930
and then we left for two years went out

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,710
west spent a ton of time out in Utah

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,930
California Arizona New Mexico Montana

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,850
Oregon Washington I mean everywhere out

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,290
west so it's really awesome took a lot

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,210
of pictures I tried to arrange these

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,000
chronologically based on my beard length

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,470
but I didn't do a very good job of that

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,610
so as we get a little bit later in these

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,250
slides it's gonna get a little bit

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,659
scarier as my lack of shaving if you

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,280
want to see a cool story asked me later

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,829
about the elk antler story so roadtrip

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
aside the point of this talk is what did

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,450
I actually learn as I was going out on

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,700
the road living in an RV

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,710
I generally had very limited Wi-Fi

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,409
connectivity but I was still working

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,710
mostly full-time doing development a lot

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,470
of WordPress and kind of what what did I

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,610
pick up from that experience so I'm

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,430
gonna try and share some of that with

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,619
you here briefly so the first one I want

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,210
to talk about is camping hacks in

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,250
general so these have nothing to do with

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,990
WordPress directly but these are good

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,080
things to know if you want to go camping

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,190
and living in the middle of nowhere but

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,410
you still want to be able to make

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,830
software so first of all there's two

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,150
apps

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,250
one is called camp and diem the other

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,570
one is called sense early camp and diem

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,370
is awesome because it tells you about

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,380
free campsites all across the country

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,170
where you can go live for free for up to

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,240
14 days and nobody will bother you

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,430
it also will tell you how many bars of

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,710
4g based on the network provider is

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,590
available at that campsite I learned

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,280
that all you need to successfully push

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,450
code to get remotely is two bars of

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,290
Verizon 4G okay that is not enough to do

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,440
a video conference on zoom or even make

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,270
a phone call okay so if your workload

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,520
involves being on phone calls and

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,870
stand-up schedule accordingly so that

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,209
you can get to somewhere that has good

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,430
internet another quick tip is that

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,450
campgrounds all advertise that they have

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,360
Wi-Fi that is a lie there is no such

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,380
thing as Wi-Fi at a campground they all

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,620
suck

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,840
a hundred percent do not even think

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,480
you're gonna go check into a campground

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,950
and use their Wi-Fi to do anything

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,459
productive at all ever did I make that

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,810
point clear they don't work okay so

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,209
that's just a little bit about like

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,680
camping hacks in general so let's talk a

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,750
little bit about some of the WordPress

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,410
specific stuff since this is a word camp

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,420
right so a couple of things on doing

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,510
remote development work with WordPress

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,940
that you need to know about if you have

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,840
very little internet and in some cases

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,340
very little electricity so I have a

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,370
12-volt battery system in my camper that

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,920
I can run for about two days if you're

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,840
gonna calculate how long you can last on

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,180
battery you need to know your electrical

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,100
consumption in amps and you multiply

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,320
that by the number of hours that you

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,900
plan on running on your battery so I

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,410
have a 200 amp hour system which means I

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,900
can run one amp for 200 hours if I'm

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,590
running 200 amps I can only run for one

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,919
hour ok so I was actually looking at how

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,940
much power is my computer using while

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:27,660
I'm on the road and I figured out that

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,520
most modern HDMI TVs use AC power

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,500
which means I have to convert the DC

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,870
power to AC which is a very inefficient

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,320
conversion and then that TV is gonna

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,490
suck power even when it's not on

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,070
computer monitors on the other hand

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,780
offer the ability to have a DC input so

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,060
you find a computer monitor with a 12

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,950
volt input you cut the end of the cord

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,990
off where the big heavy block is and you

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,640
throw that away and then you strip the

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,080
wires off put it on your 12 volt battery

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,270
and now you don't have to convert the

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,130
power to AC just to convert it back to

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,040
DC to run the TV they make sense I also

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,690
I also took my Mac charger cord the

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,460
little brick that sticks in the wall and

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,960
I cut that off to and strip the wires

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,790
and put that straight on my 12 volt

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,310
system I found out the hard way that

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,010
Mac's actually require a very clean

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,920
source of power they require that power

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,050
to be very well liked if you look at the

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,810
actual electrical wavelengths of the

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,180
power that your Mac requires it needs to

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,520
be very clean unfortunately deep-cycle

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,650
marine battery do not produce very clean

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,020
power so I have a very expensive

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,100
paperweight in my camper that just so

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,620
happens to look like a Mac error so no

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,060
your power consumption they plan on that

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,490
figure out how long is it going to take

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,530
you to run your batteries I actually use

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,750
a Raspberry Pi with my little computer

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,480
monitor and I can do everything I need

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,430
on right around 1 amp so that means that

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,710
on just those battery charges alone on a

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,850
single charge I can run for 200 hours

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,440
and I'm good to go

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,800
that doesn't include charging my cell

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,660
phone other than that so i Norcross is

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,000
here but I don't think he's in the room

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,920
so there's a really cool plugin called

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,260
airplane mode it was developed by a guy

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,030
named Norcross who was here at this work

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,010
camp if you haven't talked to him go go

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,960
talk to him he's a cool dude

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,000
what it basically does is it disables

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,510
all of the remote calls that WordPress

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,150
makes and it and it reroutes those two

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,820
local resources so for example when you

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,710
load up your dashboard and WordPress

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,360
checks to find out if a new version of

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,150
WordPress is available that's a remote

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,130
callback to the WordPress API and so

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,919
when that call is being made and you

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,050
don't have internet that call is going

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,360
to take 30 seconds before it times out

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,580
and fails which means that your page

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,909
load just to load the dashboard add 30

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,830
seconds to it right not very productive

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,720
in fact when you don't have internet

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,210
loading the WordPress dashboard at all

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,259
is not very productive right anything

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,659
that I have to do that I have to

00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,330
actually go into the backend and do is

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,569
gonna take a lot longer with no internet

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,900
so learn WP CLI is everybody in here at

00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:11,129
least used oup CLI ok who in here is a

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,680
master at WP CLI ok this is your call to

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,139
action go master

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,639
WP CLI I don't mean just like figure out

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,770
how to do a couple little things here

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,530
and there like go become a freaking

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,539
master at it and your productivity will

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,259
go a thousand percent higher than what

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,479
it is today

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:32,819
yeah WP CLI is a command line interface

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:36,599
for WordPress and it allows for you to

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:38,699
do all sorts of goodness like creating

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,949
users changing passwords creating

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,080
content updating settings installing

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:47,900
activating and deactivating plugins or

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,639
themes updating core deleting caches

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,590
creating post types there's so many

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
things that you can do with it and in

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,889
order to get good at it you really also

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,779
need to be pretty proficient with bash

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,319
not maybe an expert but you need to at

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:04,830
least look at it so one of the things

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,569
that I found to be very helpful in my

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,300
connectivity so again everything that I

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,759
was doing I had it was very slow just it

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,770
took ages to make a simple connection so

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,490
I learned how to do things via the CLI

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,590
because an SSH connection requires the

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,469
tiniest little bit of connectivity

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,349
versus an actual browser loading of the

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,759
WordPress site so if someone would call

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,800
me and say something like hey my

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,539
password is it I need to reset my

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,190
password rather than having to log into

00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,890
WordPress and wait for that page to load

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,099
I could just run those commands over SSH

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,279
which is much more efficient there's a

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,560
really cool thing you can do with SSH

00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,779
which is basically you edit your bash RC

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,850
file and your user profile on your

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,910
remote server and you can set it up to

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,730
run a list of commands every time you

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,040
log in so for example one of the

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,690
one of the things that I had to do

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,870
really frequently was I had to deploy

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,360
our application from development to

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,070
stage or stage 2 production and every

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
time I did it I had to log in and I had

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,560
to copy all of those commands in and

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,300
wait for them to finish and sometimes a

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,070
deployment could take me an hour because

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,440
those commands were taking a long time

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,780
to complete mainly because of my

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,640
internet connection so what I did was I

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,470
created two users I created a user

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,300
called deploy stage and a user called

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,580
deploy prada put all the deployment

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,010
scripts into my bash RC file and then

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,530
all I had to do was on my computer one

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,910
command login to that server and as soon

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,140
as it logged in I knew that all those

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,820
scripts were going to run and then I

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,740
could just leave my computer alone and I

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,180
could go play a little bit more and I

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,040
didn't have to do anything because that

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,740
was just going to run and it's all being

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,450
done on the on the remote machine so my

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,310
connection has nothing to do with the

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,030
speed with which that application

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,860
actually completes so that was nifty and

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,350
then the other thing is reducing any

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,270
sort of external dependencies so how

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,730
many of you have ever seen a plug in our

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,860
theme that DQ's the WordPress provided

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,250
jQuery and supplements it with some sort

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:09,150
of jQuery that's on a CDN I freaking

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,550
hate you don't do that okay so like I

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,710
actually have a plugin that just looks

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,660
at all the in queued assets and then

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,820
tells me if there's any better remote

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,380
and then if they do it just DQ's that

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,800
asset so I don't have to wait for any

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:26,610
remote error remote calls to timeout or

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,690
404 or whatever they're gonna do all

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,160
right so that's a little bit about

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,320
WordPress stuff so the other thing I

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,940
wanted to talk about was redundancy so

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,950
these things have to do mostly with

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,750
developing but I realized as I was

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,000
putting these up that there's actually a

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,890
lot of benefit to having these even if

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,150
you're not gonna go travel and live in a

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,480
camper

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,430
the first one is electricity you need to

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,500
have more than one sources of

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,750
electricity now if you work in an office

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,760
you can pretty much assume that your

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,680
power is gonna stay on but what if your

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,840
power goes off how are you gonna get

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,180
your work done do you does your office

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,860
have a battery backup of some type that

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,330
you can work off of at least for a

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,280
little while to get things done if your

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,050
power goes out if not you probably

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,910
should

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,490
when I was working I got hit by an

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,740
electrical storm lightning struck within

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,860
a mile of our camper and I lost all of

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,140
our power so I had I was working with an

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,910
enterprise client I won't name them but

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,170
they're one of the really really big

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,570
WordPress multi sites that runs and they

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,030
I was on the call with them as a sales

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,250
call and I had just lost all the power

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,890
in my camper so I was literally sitting

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,560
there on the phone with them in the gas

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,170
station parking lot plugged into an

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,300
extension cord that was unauthorized

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,200
plugged into the gas stations power

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,660
taking notes on paper right I was like

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,600
man if the people had have seen me

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,400
taking notes on paper they probably

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,550
would not have given us that contract so

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,600
have have backups for electricity have

00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,280
backup devices

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,080
I mentioned that I fried my laptop that

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,140
was actually the second laptop that I

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,660
fried on the trip so it really stinks

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,150
when you have no computer so have backup

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,830
devices right what happens if if your

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,930
office gets broken into and they steal

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,700
your computers what are you gonna do on

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,570
the next day like do you have a back-up

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,580
plan for covering your devices similarly

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,110
for internet providers right what

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,020
happens if your cable connection goes

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,940
out do you have a 4G backup that you can

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,410
rely on these are things that even

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,360
though you may not be travelling and

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,490
going off grid it's still really

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,030
important to have just in terms of being

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,500
able to conduct this business reliably

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,300
there was a hat do you who does anybody

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,160
remember when all the DNS in the world

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,670
went out and Twitter was off for like

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,500
two days okay having some way to

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,450
communicate if you rely on something

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,900
like Twitter to communicate and it goes

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,540
down what are you gonna do so just

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,880
things like that with social media there

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,710
was a really cool hack where I took the

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,480
github IP address and put it into my

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,280
Etsy host file so that I didn't need to

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,800
do DNS lookups anytime I talked to

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,420
github so if my DNS went down I could

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,340
still communicate with github even

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,370
though I didn't have DNS and that was

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,190
really helpful and then lastly is

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,410
version control everything like if it's

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,520
important to you put it on github it can

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,670
be private

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,230
but literally I put everything on github

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,630
that I can't have so many private

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,280
repositories it's ridiculous because

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,740
like even simple things like that

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,260
deployment process that I mentioned well

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,940
if that script gets lost and I've got to

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,800
rewrite a deployment script that could

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,350
be hours of lost productivity so keep

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,390
everything version controlled by version

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:49,290
control almost everything in my life now

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,760
if it's text-based basically and so

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,100
that's kind of it on the redundancy

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:59,270
pieces a couple of just inspirational

00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:01,680
thoughts so let me think yeah so I

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,090
mentioned this road trip obviously as

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,460
you can see from these pictures I went

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,200
to more than a couple cool places

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,330
there's a lot of amazing stuff in this

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,250
country and I feel like I still haven't

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,750
seen it all in fact I feel like the more

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,370
I see the more I realize how much is out

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,060
there that I haven't seen and that I

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,190
want to go see these places are not

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,920
gonna be here forever so if you have a

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,900
desire to go see something go see it

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,470
right now like don't even come back to

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,080
word camp to me I'm just kidding like

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,210
Julian's like I'm gonna kill you so yeah

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,330
like if you have a if you have a desire

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,330
to travel go do it we live in a time

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,880
when this is possible we we have the

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,430
technology to make this possible and I

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,050
think in myself included like it's so

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,020
easy to just get in the habit of not

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,060
doing anything that's cool and amazing

00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,740
because you have so much work to do like

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,590
take your work with you take it on the

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,240
road go travel for a week say hey I'm

00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,070
gonna take a week and I'm gonna go work

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,610
remotely and if your employer doesn't

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,490
like that then find another one I hate

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,480
or quit your job and be a freelancer and

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,790
go travel and do what you want to do the

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,980
other one is maybe go for like a month

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,750
or even a year there's a whole bunch of

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,820
different programs out there where

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,310
developers from all around the country

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,710
will actually get paid to go work

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,200
remotely for a month they rent a huge

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,260
awesome house usually in some really

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,120
amazing place like Thailand and then all

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,710
the developers just move into that house

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,270
for a month and they all do their jobs

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,750
remotely and then they get to hang out

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,730
in tile

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,709
for a whole month so like find cool

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,110
stuff like that and do it because it's

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,060
worth it it's worth just getting out of

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,079
your comfort zone seeing some of this

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,579
awesome stuff that's out there and and I

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,399
think the main thing I wanted to walk

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:53,639
away with is so we lived in Atlanta for

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,769
my entire life so the first 32 years of

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,540
my life I was in Atlanta when you live

00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,670
in one place for a long time you tend to

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,040
collect a lot of stuff you know you have

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,139
all these tie-downs I had a job I had my

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,879
kids were in a school we had a network

00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,459
of friends that we enjoyed hanging out

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,259
with and in a short period of time we

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,970
literally sold all of our stuff we

00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,949
withdrew our kids from their school I

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,500
quit my job we moved out of our house

00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,480
and we literally started with nothing

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,329
everything that we owned fit in the back

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,810
of a pickup truck so don't be afraid to

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,060
start over right you can always take an

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,519
iteration and say what is version two of

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,100
my life going to look like and be

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,759
willing and be ready to to really start

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,680
over and reinvent yourself so that's it

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,199
for me I'm out of time maybe we have

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,240
time for one or two quick questions or

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:50,279
we can just sit here and look at my cute

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:53,420
kids question what did I do for health

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,420
insurance for two years

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,699
scary I know actually we did have health

00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:01,949
insurance for a good portion of that

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,829
trip thankfully I had an employer that I

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,809
could work completely remotely for and

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,029
so they I had health insurance there but

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,829
there was a good like six months out of

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,100
that two years where we were definitely

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,899
fingers crossed and when we got back

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,850
onto health insurance like everybody

00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:20,429
went and got everything fixed it was

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,039
like yeah I broke a tooth while I was

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,809
traveling and I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,069
finally went to the dentist and got it

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:30,750
don't let's though you know there was

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:34,740
that other quick questions yeah did I

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:49,769
use a screen for anything did command

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:51,659
screen no I don't think so right yeah so

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,669
I forgot to mention this so one of the

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,370
things that I did was I used a lot of

00:17:53,669 --> 00:18:00,870
like cloud-based computing so I actually

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,210
had a VM that was running on on a cloud

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:07,440
a cloud-based system and then I could

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,179
just log into that VM and then yeah yeah

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,919
yeah and actually that was really neat

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,200
so one of the projects that I did I had

00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,269
to migrate website that was over ten

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,350
years old and it had over I think it was

00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:21,659
a million posts and almost three million

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,539
images and I had to migrate it from

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:27,750
point A to point B and so if I was going

00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,860
to try to pull that down to my local

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,440
forget it

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,000
right so instead I pulled I created a

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,950
cloud base instance just for

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,779
transferring those files and I moved it

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,269
across the internet without ever having

00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,940
to come back to my to my home and now

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,370
really helped speed things up yeah by

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,789
the way I get repo that's over a hundred

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,820
Meg's takes like never finishes when you

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,660
have it so they keep your repo small -

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:58,719
thank you

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,719
