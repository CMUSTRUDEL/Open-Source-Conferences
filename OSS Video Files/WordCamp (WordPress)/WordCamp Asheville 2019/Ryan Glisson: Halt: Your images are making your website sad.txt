Title: Ryan Glisson: Halt: Your images are making your website sad
Publication date: 2019-09-06
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	In my 15 years of overall web dev experience, 10 years of direct WP work, I still see the same mistakes being made. Image sizes. In my opinion, this is one of the quickest ways to bring a great website to its demise. So Iâ€™d like to highlight the importance of web-sized and dimension photos, the impact it has on your hosting server, and how to better handle uploading pics moving forward.
Takeaways:
What images to use where
Image dimensions and sizes for websites
Server load and overall website processes attributed to loading images

yeah so this morning we're going to talk

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,580
about images and your website very very

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,070
very important and probably one of my

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,539
biggest pet peeves that's why I chose to

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,869
to talk on this topic so I titled it hot

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,250
your images are making your website sad

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,949
so how many times have you gone to a

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,579
website and just waited and waited and

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,960
waited for the site to load you know

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,260
while you're waiting on the content you

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,469
know to load as well you got images just

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,070
choppy you know waiting you know that's

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,690
no fun

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,579
nobody wants to sit there and wait on a

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,379
website to load like that especially in

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,050
2019 maybe that would have worked when

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,300
we saw at 56k but not nowadays so

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,010
there's a lot of different you know

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,140
aspects when it comes to images and your

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,840
website so you know a few things we're

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,390
going to talk about are the impact of

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,799
images you know user experience why we

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,090
even put them on the website to begin

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,210
with you know you hear a lot of people

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,000
say don't use hero images you know get

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,080
straight to the content this and that I

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,040
agree with a lot of that but I also

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,439
think website should be beautiful I am

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,439
an artist in that regard not a good

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,030
artist I don't think but uh yeah so

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,479
anyways we're gonna go over types of

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,810
images that you might use on your

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,299
website so you may have heard of the

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,350
typical JPEG the PNG file the gif file

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,000
those are the standard files you're

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,040
going to use primarily on your website

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,520
which you know a lot of this may be

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,689
common knowledge to a lot of you guys

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,130
but we're gonna go over you know the

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,520
different types and where to use them

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,500
how to use them and then we're going to

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,070
go over file sizes the three different

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,700
file types have their varying

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:05,100
characteristics in terms of file sizes

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,489
so there's a you know there's a

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,750
difference between dpi dimensions lots

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,819
of things that you need to keep in mind

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,060
when you're uploading these files these

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,230
images to your website

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,120
so again yeah where do you use the

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,409
different types of images we're gonna go

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
over how to save the images that's

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,709
important

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,390
many people get hung up on you know

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,159
ahead it took a photo of my iPhone how

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,200
did I get it on the website where I

00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,349
uploaded it to my website and now it's

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,840
just huge that sort of stuff so we'll go

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,060
over that and then we'll go over how to

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,079
style or your style your photos how to

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,849
take them for the website the creative

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:44,670
side of it the fun part really in my

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,129
opinion not all of us are photographers

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,169
I'm not but you know with today's

00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,299
technology most of your iPhones or

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,150
smartphones can take a photo quality

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,419
enough with the natural lighting to make

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,569
your website pop to do the job so where

00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:03,780
it all began for me 21 years ago I

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:07,139
started with geo cities angelfire that

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,700
may ring a bell to some of you guys some

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,849
of you may be way too young to even know

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,790
what that means so yeah back in the day

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,799
it was all just pure HTML that sort of

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,239
stuff and my first web site was for the

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,030
Taco Bell dog and Spice Girls the whole

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,829
site was you know just raw HTML and what

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,180
I learned and what you know why even

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,479
bring this up is what I learned back

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,970
then you know 21 years ago a lot of the

00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,970
techniques I learned then you know still

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,889
apply today you still don't want the

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,150
websites to take forever to load you

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,010
still want them to you know be

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,549
captivating you still want you know

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,590
great imagery you still save the images

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,030
a lot you know in the same way at least

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,590
I do I'm gonna show you my method and

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,810
yeah so I think it works

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,340
so what we're gonna go over also is the

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,250
difference between aesthetics and

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,650
functionality again a second ago I

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,269
brought up dpi that's kind of the only

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,989
thing you hear about when people talk

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,489
about images you never really hear about

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,379
kilobytes you never really hear about

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,280
pixel dimensions unfortunately and those

00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,530
are very pertinent details when it comes

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,979
to web development and design and what

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,260
we do unfortunately though again dpi is

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,610
like the heavy heavy hitter in the image

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,279
realm

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,210
what is dpi you probably know that's per

00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,430
inch

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,870
you know you'll probably see a lot of

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:37,410
people say 300dpi for print 72dpi for

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,090
web those rules more or less apply but

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,190
they are less important than the overall

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,130
file size and the dimensions of your

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:47,070
image

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,720
so yeah so what's ideal for web and

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,640
what's ideal for different parts of your

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,540
website you know it really depends on

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,670
your intended usage you know if you have

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,850
a website say if you have a small

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:03,270
website just a simple you know four page

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,980
about Us website kind of thing you can

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,480
sometimes get away with a little bit

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,340
more file size however if you're talking

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,770
like a huge blue commerce website with

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,290
hundreds of products you really don't

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,720
want you want to maximize you know your

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,050
server you don't or minimize your server

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,640
load you don't want your file sizes to

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,920
be excessive you want to keep them down

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,290
to a minimum so again it really depends

00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,900
on your intended usage if you have two

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,750
two images on your homepage you can get

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,980
away with a little bit more all things

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,380
that you want to pay mine to while

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,540
you're developing the site and sometimes

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,250
we're not always in control of the

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,960
images that we get so sometimes you have

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,320
to give creative direction to whomever

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,490
is providing those images or in some

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,940
cases we even have to do some

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,870
manipulation photoshopping or just you

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,700
know compression that sort of thing so

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,090
just to put it in kind of you know

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,710
everyday terms maybe it's everyday terms

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,600
it might be archaic now again but

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,720
downloading mp3s nobody really does that

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,850
anymore but if you ever did download an

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,770
mp3 or you download something off of

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,170
iTunes you know the file size that

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,270
you're getting if you were to get an mp3

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,820
you're getting about a five megabyte

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,820
file give or take for roughly a three

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,500
three and a half minute song iTunes is

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,390
gonna be a lossless file so it's gonna

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,800
be much larger

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:30,360
20:19 it's a it's a different time but

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,250
anyways mp3s so let's just backtrack say

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,340
you have ten slider images on your

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,440
homepage each of those images are 500

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,330
kilobytes in size you're looking at

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,680
roughly give or take a five megabyte

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,449
just initial load right

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,130
on your homepage nobody wants that you

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,100
don't want that your server doesn't want

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,680
that your host doesn't want that and

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,350
it's just it's you know it's bad

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,900
practice so to put that again into

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,520
everyday terms you know if you have ten

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,280
slider images that's about the size of

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,500
an mp3 file of a song and audio files

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,389
are much larger than compressed images

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,800
for your website it's a different world

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,410
you really don't want to be getting into

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,220
that territory in terms of file sizes on

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:18,000
your website we talked about JPEGs pngs

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:19,320
and gifts you guys raised up hands if

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,830
you know the difference more or less

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,840
between you know is a PNG or a gif which

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,639
one is animated is a PNG raise your hand

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,500
or is a gift right on cool so we don't

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,370
really use gifts a whole lot more in

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,860
websites they kind of look bad you see

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,930
them a lot now on like social media that

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,940
sort of thing as jokes you know memes

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,690
that sort of thing not taken seriously

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,240
but websites we do take seriously so

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,430
gifts we use them very sparingly and I

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,310
think the only time I really ever shred

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,349
into gif territory is if my PNG file

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,820
that I'm trying to use happens to just

00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:01,740
be way way too large so JPEGs you have

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,289
the ability to compress you have more

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,530
freedom of you know saying I want it to

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,509
to be optimized for web you know you can

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,949
control the actual percentage of you

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,479
know the lossless quality of the image

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,870
PNG files you do not have that freedom

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,080
they just save in perfect great quality

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,699
and the beauty of PNG files is that you

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,740
can use them sparingly and you can use

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,580
them in design aspects where there's

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,889
like nice fades or nice overlays and if

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,860
when designed right they work they work

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:40,229
great and again gifts not used a whole

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:43,610
lot anymore so about aesthetics you know

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,870
again I'm all about functionality and

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,240
you know getting to the meat of the

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,650
content of course that's that's why we

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,450
even have the website the website is

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,490
there for a reason

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,600
nine times out of ten it's not for

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,750
unless you're a photographer

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,339
it's not for the photos however you know

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,870
the photos are incredibly important

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,440
billboards

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,759
everything is you know photo these days

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,620
especially you'll notice a lot of

00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,290
websites now are just going to flat out

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,389
full screens when you load them it's

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:18,240
just a photo or even not even on topic

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,649
here but videos now that's that's a

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,899
whole nother beast and we won't even

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,940
touch on that but you're seeing a lot of

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,110
videos as backgrounds even on my own

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:30,329
portfolio site you know but that again

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,889
you know is kind of the same applies the

00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,420
same techniques and concept you know

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,709
keep the file sizes to a minimum

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:41,160
compressed for web etc yes so slider

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:43,470
images for example they need to be well

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,279
thought out you guys are familiar with

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,959
the hero slider image I'm assuming so

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,339
you have you know different different

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,110
variations yeah like I said you have

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,720
websites that load with no text just

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,339
beautiful imagery they kind of just you

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,480
know that the down arrow that just says

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,269
you know scroll down for more

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,310
information but it's really that image

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,870
that's you know keeping the user you

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,209
know there for a few seconds saying wow

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,380
I want to be here I want to scroll down

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:13,769
and see more so yeah and then you have

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,259
the option to add text on them you'll

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,880
see some websites put a lot of text on

00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:21,360
their homepage right there on the first

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,449
scroll I mean you know the idea is to

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,279
not overwhelm your user you want them to

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,569
get to your site know what your what

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,029
they're seeing know what the site is

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,620
about what they're there for you know

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,730
within the first few seconds and never

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,720
feel overwhelmed you know if they

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,250
overwhelm they're gonna click away

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,620
you're gonna lose their their lead

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,790
you're gonna lose you know the website

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,610
business yeah and another thing is image

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,490
focus the subject of the image is very

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,199
important a lot of you know like a lot

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,199
of slider images like for example this

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,870
is horizontal a lot of slider images

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,579
they will just kind of slap a photo in

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,240
there and not pay attention to where the

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,740
subject is and in the image and how that

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,180
actually looks on the website for

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,269
example if we're talking about a coffee

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,620
website or a coffee shop we have a

00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,480
coffee mug and we have some text to the

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,670
we don't necessarily want the text to

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,400
sit on top of the mug so we want to you

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,860
know take that photo for the website in

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,900
mind you know that keeping in mind that

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,450
we're gonna put text on top of it that

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,200
sort of thing you also want to think

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,180
about space for your navbar you'll see

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,780
some websites with big thick solid color

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,990
nav bars I think we've moved into kind

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,610
of a time where people do need to see

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,890
the navigation they wanted it they want

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,150
they you know they want to know how to

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,880
get to where they're going to on the

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,190
site but they don't want that to take up

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,390
200 pixels of their homepage they're

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,390
wanting you know what people want to see

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,950
nowadays are beautiful images they want

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,190
the navbar to be there you need it there

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,070
but you don't need that to obstruct your

00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:00,310
overall design unless it plays a role in

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,260
the design of course but so again images

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,460
that you take for your website you want

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,230
to keep in mind that you're gonna have a

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,800
nav bar at the top maybe a logo up there

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,990
as well so for example if we have like a

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,490
photo of a tree in the background you

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,620
know and your logo happens to be a

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,370
little bit on the busy side it's not

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,870
gonna work

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,450
with that tree back there and your logo

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:26,530
on top just doesn't make free a pretty

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:31,870
website so yeah so hero and slider

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:33,340
images so my recommendation and what

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,970
you'll see a lot about recommendations

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,310
of our about 1,900 pixels wide as your

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,480
max and so this is your actual file

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:46,510
dimension size our image dimension size

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:51,010
so about 1,900 pixels wide is going to

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:53,740
be your suggested width here so for

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,560
example if someone has a you know a big

00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,530
ol screen that if the website if you if

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,440
you develop it properly do responsive

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,760
CSS 1900 pixels

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,320
scaled up a little bit larger is not

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,290
gonna really look you're not going to

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,630
notice a difference in quality however

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,420
you know if you have a 700 pixel slider

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,540
image scaled up to even just a you know

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,430
a 23 inch monitor or you know go even

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,500
bigger you're gonna really see the

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,770
quality you know you can see the pixels

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,740
you're gonna see the

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,710
the compression in the image so again

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:33,350
1,900 pixels is my suggested width here

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:35,180
for slider images again 72 dpi is its

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,170
preferred but that is less important

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:42,500
than the overall dimensions of file size

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:45,320
now we talked about the actual kilobyte

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,850
size so there's kind of three different

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,020
sizes we're talking about we're talking

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:55,270
size you know we're talking size in

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,270
terms of the file and then we're talking

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:02,300
another size sorry anyways yes so

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,610
basically 500 kilobytes is going to be

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,430
the max that you want to save this at

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,850
and that's even like for your biggest in

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,350
your most detailed photo I would even

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,370
suggest keeping it at a hundred

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,700
kilobytes or less if you can you know

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,160
some photos you can get away with that

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,260
some photos that have more detail we're

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,090
gonna want to you know just have they're

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,530
gonna want to save more detail in the

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:31,240
photo so the file size is going to

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,240
naturally be a little bit larger but

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,560
yeah that is very important and so for

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,670
example if you take a photo on your

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,970
phone and you want to use it on your

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:47,000
website most phones are saving images

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,640
that like anywhere between 2 and like 12

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,230
megabytes now way too large for your

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,460
website so we'll go over how to get that

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,870
from one place to another here in a

00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,850
second

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,910
something else to keep in mind is you

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,640
know monitors websites we mostly see

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,790
them from a whi perspective unless we're

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,790
looking at websites on our phone in

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,410
which case you know that that is where

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,810
development comes in play response to

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,400
CSS comes in play and you just scale

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,680
your you know your viewport down

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,630
appropriately but we're gonna we're

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:27,220
primarily focus right now on the desktop

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:27,220
version or the laptop version absolutely

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,130
just two main maintain your aspect ratio

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,520
of the image you know of course you

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,280
don't want to go crazy with like 2500

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,410
3000 pixels tall image but if it were

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,990
that tall then it would naturally be

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,350
wider than 1,900 pixels

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,360
you know 1,900 pixels I mean not yeah

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,600
say that back you know it that's not

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,010
true but in most cases 1,900 pixels

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,510
you're not gonna have an image much

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:01,010
taller than 1200 pixels ish give or take

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,230
if it's taken with a phone or if it's

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,820
you know taken with a camera you know

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,250
someone photoshopped an image of course

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,290
you can Photoshop anything you want and

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,940
I've seen websites utilize background

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,550
images before you know 2,000 pixels wide

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:21,440
and they they had a rather than using

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:24,200
like a repeated pattern or you know I'm

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,450
a transparent or easing like CSS or

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,550
anything they just they straight up just

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,950
to use a Photoshop image from top all

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,530
the way down to the footer and we're

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:38,140
talking you know 7,500 10,000 pixels

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:43,490
tall and a 25 megabyte image you know

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:45,770
it's it's you know it it's done

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,030
but yeah so in terms of height you know

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,060
you just want to maintain an aspect

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,590
ratio of your image of course and in

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,390
some cases you know the splatter images

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,340
you can get away with you know cutting

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,540
the top of the bottom or cropping your

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:04,790
images accordingly that sort of thing

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:08,060
yes that cleared up yeah so that kind of

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:11,600
covers slider images hero images so we

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,070
also have content images you know of

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,420
course you scroll down past the height

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,790
of the hero image and then there's more

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,170
to the website you've got the content so

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,870
that's what we're where everyone's here

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,420
for they're not really here to sit there

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,890
and just stare at your homepage let's

00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,770
backtrack actually to because I didn't

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,220
cover something when when I say people

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,570
aren't here to stare at your homepage

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:37,250
brings up a great point on your hero and

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,390
slider images some people will cram 10

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,360
images

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:45,170
and no offense to anyone in here if you

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,480
have a lot of slider images you know but

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,460
it's it's preferred or it's suggested to

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,320
really keep that you know it's down to a

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,620
minimum you know just enough to get your

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,750
point across I like to see three to five

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,440
on sites I develop at the very very very

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,050
most it kills me when I want to have to

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,760
do seven ten something like that because

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,740
then you're starting to have to

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,180
compromise image quality for load time

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,450
that sort of thing yeah so you know the

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,730
number of slider images does play a key

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:21,830
role as well and are you guys familiar

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:25,100
with my revolution slider any of the big

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,410
slider plugins or anything they

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,640
typically will take care of like the

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,190
scaling of the image for you so in most

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,020
cases and in most cases are more press

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,030
in general you know you just you upload

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,080
the photo and it does the responsive or

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,660
it does the scaling for you but yeah so

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,270
again three to five and your slider yes

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,270
ma'am

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,270
sure

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,400
[Music]

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,460
right so some sites will load where the

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,610
image is full with and you don't see any

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,080
of the content below your initial load

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,090
they're taking there they're telling the

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,240
slider no matter what size your screen

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,150
is always take up the full width of the

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:27,669
viewport upon first load always show

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:30,610
full screen image I love it I personally

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,679
love it so long as you indicate you know

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:36,010
depending on your your target audience

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,660
and the website you know if your target

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,590
audience is younger most of them

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,820
understand to keep scrolling down if you

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,960
have an older target audience you

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,360
sometimes need to indicate you know

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,130
scroll down for more you know that this

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,530
is if you're utilizing the full screen

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,520
load you know or the arrow down to

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,840
indicate that there's more down below

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,809
but you also see some sites you know

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,190
that are almost full screen but there's

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,710
still just like a little peak of the

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,220
content down below there they are not

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,260
utilizing any sort of coding to say you

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,419
know hey image take up the full screen

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,910
they just have like a set you know

00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:15,100
probably you know take up the full width

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,760
of the browser window but only make it

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,460
say 900 pixels tall and in terms of

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,010
suggestion I have there most of my

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,919
slider images I will do you know if it's

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,809
a full screen web site 1900 by anywhere

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,330
between depending on the crop of the

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:35,669
image what we're trying to focus on the

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:38,770
image on 1080 or light 1200 at the most

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:41,320
and again I do a lot of compression on

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:45,790
my images to you know to make sure that

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,720
the file sizes are small basically again

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:52,960
we'll go over that in a moment yeah

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,000
basically yeah the big full screen you

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,130
know full screen load what you what

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,929
you've brought up is popping up a lot

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,000
now though

00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,280
yeah and in terms of the height for

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,290
those images it doesn't really matter

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,450
what height the image is because the

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,700
coding is telling the image to take up

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,260
the full width so you know so long as

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,520
it's a good quality and it's the right

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,450
height it's gonna look good in there

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,120
that makes sense

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:22,390
more or less okay so content images so

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,530
again as you scroll past the hero image

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,460
or the first scroll of your website

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:30,170
you've got content this can get a little

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,150
tricky because there's so many different

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,070
ways to lay images out within your

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,419
content I mean again there is with with

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,710
sliders as well but we're just kind of

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:41,240
touching going over the basics there but

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:46,700
with content images you're seeing a lot

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:50,960
nowadays of like overlapping images a

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,799
lot of like my odd spacings and I like

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,440
it but yeah it kind of makes things a

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,780
little bit trickier in terms of how you

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,260
approach you know adding the image any

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:08,590
of you guys use like visual composer or

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:13,340
Divi or X or any of the theme builders

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,799
raise of hands yeah so most of those

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,380
kind of have like just you know you can

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:21,650
kind of set the columns you know of

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,059
course and it does the work for you what

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,270
you want to pay attention to there and

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,770
that may be speaking the stuff you

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,120
already know but you know obviously the

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:33,590
file size and the quality of the image

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,640
again so you basically have left right

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,350
or center but again some websites have

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,179
for the content and the imagery goes all

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,290
the way out so in that case you want to

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,100
you know do you want your image to be

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,510
fifty percent you want it to be

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,929
twenty-five percent do you want it to be

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,490
you know two thirds all things to pay

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,160
attention to while you're developing and

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,020
designing your website also want to keep

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:02,510
in mind the surrounding text around the

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:04,450
image it seems to be kind of like the

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,220
last thing thought about is the text

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,990
it's like oh we have this image we have

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,100
dummy content in place dummy text in

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,590
place and

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,270
then you try to actually fill it with

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,220
real content and then you find yourself

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,419
short

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,900
so you have an image over here on the

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:22,280
left taking up 50% of your your viewport

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,809
but then you only have two sentences on

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,679
the right so you have just this really

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:29,059
clunky looking content area in my

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,460
opinion and I think in most people's

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,480
opinion that doesn't look good so you

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,400
want to think that out while you're

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,970
designing and picking out images for

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,130
your site

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,370
you know either don't have the image

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:43,159
there at all right more content that's a

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,860
slippery slope but there are ways to

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,710
design around that for sure and you'll

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,390
see even you know we're talking right

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,760
now you know we've only discussed you

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,110
know kind of images that taken with kind

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,340
of a camera but there's all sorts of

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,330
different types of images you know

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,760
there's illustrations there are you know

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,289
just solid color bars you know which you

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,530
wouldn't actually use an image file for

00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:10,280
you I hope you would use you know CSS or

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,539
something along those lines but yeah

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,980
so there's a bunch of different ways

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,090
that you can actually lay out your

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,100
content and utilize the images another

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,289
thing you also see a lot of nowadays is

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,830
you know an image as the background with

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:26,840
text on top of it again it's smart to

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,200
think about you know what image you're

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,460
gonna put in that background smooth

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,380
smooth details in the background you

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,620
know again trees never really work as

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,030
background images rarely I don't know a

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,440
whole lot about trees but most of the

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,270
ones that I'm given or just a whole

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:47,000
bunch of leaves and branches all over

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:49,510
the place but yeah so this sounds like a

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,510
tree right

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,630
but yeah smooth images work great in the

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,550
background and again when you're

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,300
slapping text on top of images you see

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:05,910
it a lot now people are also putting

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:09,390
like a semi-transparent color on top of

00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,560
the image a number of different ways you

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,650
can go about that you can actually

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,690
Photoshop that into your image or my

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:21,390
preferred method is if you're using Divi

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:23,580
or X or a theme builder utilize the the

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,590
element you know the row or your column

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,240
actually put your image in that

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,920
background column and then you have you

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,660
know another layer on top of it where

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,880
you'll actually set a transparent color

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,920
on top of that so that way when you pass

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,870
the website off to the client they can

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,980
go in and put any image they want of

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,630
trees or whatever in that background

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,450
image and not have to go into Photoshop

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:50,250
and color it or put the overlay on does

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:52,800
that make sense so yeah there's a lot of

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:56,970
things that you can do with CSS that

00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,330
kind of give the visual aesthetic of an

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,580
image but they aren't actually image

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,780
files so that kind of brings up

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,400
something else and we'll go over that

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:11,300
here in a moment I think it's later on

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,300
so how to save images

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:18,150
most of us were using Photoshop to

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:21,150
manipulate our photos illustrator is

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,870
going to be more of your creative print

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:29,220
stuff not a lot of web not in my world

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:32,010
at least 15 years 20 years of this and

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,130
then InDesign is gonna be more of like

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,050
official print people are doing you know

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,540
some website stuff in there as well but

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:44,370
primarily you're gonna do most of your

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:46,110
quick dirty work in Photoshop so

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,570
Photoshop has a beautiful feature called

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,590
save for web so any image that you have

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,970
in Photoshop you can save for web and

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:57,240
that I believe it's now actually a

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,370
legacy feature they have other methods

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,650
other ways to do this but so long as

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,850
it's a still a feature in Photoshop I'm

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,160
gonna jump to it because it is the

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,880
quickest and the most streamlined way to

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,250
just get the

00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,810
I've done so yeah save us for web and so

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,060
when you're actually doing this you'll

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,730
see in the top right you have they drop

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,820
down words as JPEG in that section you

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:24,390
can select if you're saving a JPEG a gif

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,070
file or a PNG file whatever you want and

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,770
then you actually have down just to the

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,590
bottom right path you have the quality

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,650
drop-down so you can get as you can get

00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,060
away with qualities as low as 20%

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,720
sometimes and not even really see a

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:41,910
difference you know if you're using

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,020
let's jump back to putting images in the

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,910
background of your site with the

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,480
transparent color on top of it and then

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,370
text on top of that those background

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,590
images in there you can get away with

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,910
like really really notching the quality

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,110
down on those because people aren't

00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,000
gonna really be paying attention to

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,220
those they're really focused on the text

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,740
on top of it it's got a color on top of

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,290
it too so you can get away with making

00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,790
that a super small image size what's

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,310
your website will love and so will the

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:13,430
user who's viewing your website they

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:15,930
just won't know it so yeah so again

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,850
you've got the save appropriate file

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,100
type for usage so we talked about the

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,680
three different types JPEGs are gonna be

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,270
primarily used for your hero and slider

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,720
images anything that doesn't have a

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,730
transparency and again JPEGs you can

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,410
really you have a lot of control over

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,240
the file size and we talked about the

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,450
different file sizes and then down here

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,700
it'll always give you a preview so that

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,230
says 174 K down there that's a really

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,470
great nd I mean that that tells you how

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:52,920
big your file size is gonna say that so

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:55,380
again I said 500 K at the top at the

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,970
most and I'm saying that the most like

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,400
you kind of just never even want to go

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,840
there that's if the clients saying I

00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,840
have to have this picture on the website

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:12,840
yeah so 500 K top and then you also have

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,980
down over here so there are a number of

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,360
different ways you can resize your

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,400
photos you can just open them up real

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,440
quick then hit file save as for web and

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,120
then you can actually control your

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,380
you can change the dimension size so if

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,960
you have like the photo from your phone

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,630
and it's 5,000 pixels wide way too wide

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,130
for your website open that image up in

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,200
Photoshop

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,510
then it just don't do anything to it

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,160
then just save us for web and then down

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,070
here you can just change your file size

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,190
so you know with set to say it's a

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,300
slider image 1900 wide and that's where

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,560
you'll make those changes quick

00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,160
on-the-fly so you don't have to actually

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,090
know how to work Photoshop you just have

00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,220
to know how to open an image and save it

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,350
and Photoshop used to be at one point

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,360
you know super expensive but I feel like

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,730
it's a kind of a necessary tool for what

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,740
we do and I think they've it's like 9

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,320
bucks a month now 20 dollars a month now

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:09,180
for a package with like Lightroom

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,590
there's almost no reason to not use

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,370
Photoshop now I mean there are other

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,960
options there are free options but they

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,180
don't give you the robust functionality

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,090
so if you do want to expand and you do

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,280
want to do more than just simply opening

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,710
and saving you have that with Photoshop

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,170
you have with others but Photoshop is

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,760
there's a reason it's it's where it's at

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,760
and has been for my entire life

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,250
so the photography is gonna come with I

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,660
think Lightroom it depends on how

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,030
in-depth you're gonna get with your

00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,980
photos you know if you're just snapping

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,690
them with your phone and you want to

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,880
just upload them I wouldn't you don't

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,200
need Lightroom anything you can do in

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,120
Lightroom you can do in Photoshop in

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,010
that regard but if you want to get

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,570
really fancy with your photos and you're

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,950
a professional photographer you probably

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:08,070
already have Lightroom but no I mean you

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:16,690
don't need Lightroom at all

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:20,020
just Photoshop mm-hmm gosh I think it's

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:22,950
 is something I it's been like a

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:29,650
Photoshop contender for a long time

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:31,990
 I'll be honest I stopped messing

00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:36,130
with those so long ago I wouldn't know

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:39,220
what what what was out there in terms of

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:42,610
the photo stuff Photoshop has just been

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:48,460
my go-to tool for you know forever now

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:50,380
so you know there are even you know

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,120
mobile apps now I think you can download

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,280
like a mobile photo you can download a

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,830
mobile Photoshop I think it's free and

00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:04,030
maybe ten dollars or twenty that what it

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:05,620
is yeah so I mean you have apps on your

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,880
phone too if you just never even want to

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,800
touch a computer and you know you can

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,510
log into your dashboards WordPress on

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,100
your phones and we can do a lot of what

00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,350
we do from our phones that's not the

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,850
preferred way but it can be done if

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:21,790
we're super busy and then it's the kind

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:23,800
of lifestyle we live but yeah many

00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,630
options there even like websites now you

00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,480
know I think you could just Google you

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,640
know online Photoshop or online free

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
Photoshop and there's like literal just

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,230
websites now that you know have an

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,450
online application that you can use

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:43,700
without even downloading anything but

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:49,550
again Photoshop is is the way to go

00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:51,320
so styling and taking your photos so

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,140
again it's very important my opinion to

00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:02,630
leave room for your images to be able to

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:04,550
breathe mouse yeah so a lot of a lot of

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,570
websites you know you'll see images

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,010
cropped really close up and sometimes

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,870
you'll just be browsing and navigating a

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,640
website and it just doesn't feel good it

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,380
just feels clunky you just don't feel

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,080
good visiting it you don't know really

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,540
where to find your content a lot of that

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,040
has to do with just the focus and the

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:28,040
the way the images were approached you

00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,660
want to again let them breathe so for

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,910
example if you're using a slider image

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,560
for the full width and you have a focus

00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,390
you know of course you can get creative

00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,290
if you have like a macro lens or you're

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,540
doing something like that

00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,700
you know there's there's the creative

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,340
side of you know zooming in on your your

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,650
focus elements but by and large you want

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,570
to to have your focus elements and still

00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,100
have room to breathe on the outsides and

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,860
the sides of your image

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,160
and that goes for everything you know if

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:58,130
you have like staff photos for example

00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,510
you know it really it's no fun to just

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,890
go to the about Us page with a staff

00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,890
page and just see the people's faces

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:06,140
like this you know let them let the

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,790
image breathe if you get the image from

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,000
the photographer and you can you're able

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,140
to crop it you know obviously you don't

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,419
let their heads look like peanuts and

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,260
the photos either but you want you know

00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:22,400
you want a nice crop breathable images

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,500
make and carry a website you don't want

00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,140
to over saw our overuse Photoshop I mean

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,550
I say use Photoshop and it's the best

00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,600
but I really use it minimally

00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:34,610
I use it really just as a tool to more

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,400
or less take you know when I'm not

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:41,090
designing a site I will take the design

00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,310
file from the designer and usually

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,250
provided an illustrator or InDesign or

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:48,890
Photoshop and I'll take you know and

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,040
usually they'll give me a it's it's a

00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,390
much higher resolution file than I need

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,090
so I'll take the elements and the images

00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,350
that I need just copy the new file save

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,830
copy new file

00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:03,790
safe so there's not a whole lot of

00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:06,380
actual photo manipulation if ever really

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:11,770
when it comes to just simply developing

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:14,570
and designing the sites so in terms of

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,160
yeah so saying don't photo shot over use

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,440
the effects so for example if you have

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,420
like drop shadows in your image and you

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,070
want a nice drop shadow to be you know

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,320
on the content of your you know the

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,850
content section of your about Us page

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,180
you don't have to Photoshop that drop

00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:31,640
shadow you can but say for example you

00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:35,030
have like a pattern background in your

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,530
drop shadow your options are to save

00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,870
that image with the drop shadow as

00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,700
either a PNG file or a gift because you

00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,950
don't want the drop shadow to over lay

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,910
your pattern background and look weird

00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,370
does that make sense

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,310
so if you save that image as a JPEG it's

00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:51,530
going to want to fill the the gradient

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,690
of the drop shadow in with white or a

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:57,860
solid color because JPEGs don't show

00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,470
transparencies so if you have a website

00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,940
with the pattern background a drop

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,730
shadow image on top of it

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,920
my suggested method will be T to use

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,410
Photoshop as less as least as possible

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,450
so that drop shadow comes into play with

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,120
CSS you don't Photoshop that you don't

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:18,110
save a PNG you don't save a gif you save

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,570
a super low you know low file size jpg

00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:23,930
file and then you photos or you with CSS

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,110
add that drop shadow in so in the design

00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:29,270
you know a lot of times we'll get from

00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:32,980
designers files you know a lot of things

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:35,630
back to you know the color transparency

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,580
it suggested to not photoshop that

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,750
transparency on there because then six

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,310
months down the road when you want to

00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,440
change the photo you have to know

00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,940
exactly the color of that transparence

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,350
you have to know exactly the opacity of

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,570
it to recreate that image so if you you

00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,330
know use a lot if you utilize CSS for

00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,750
some of your effects or some of the you

00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,580
know aesthetic styling then you'll you

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,160
know you'll still give the visual

00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:05,420
aesthetic of an image of the design that

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,330
the designer provided to you but it will

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,160
again increase load times or decrease

00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:15,339
load times

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,339
that sort of thing rollovers for example

00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:24,799
roller rollovers for example are a great

00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:30,529
usage or a great chance to use CSS over

00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:32,119
two images even as as you know reason is

00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:35,839
like five six years ago you'll see

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,519
people doing rollovers says you know the

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,490
about us is white text you roll over it

00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:44,000
has you know it turns green

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,039
just a simple really basic example they

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,829
were using two photos for that for that

00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:51,230
particular effect they're you know

00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:53,690
obviously you want to utilize CSS in

00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,279
every case scenario that you can for

00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,150
those particular effects and that type

00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:01,250
of stuff as well a lot of things a lot

00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,779
of websites you'll see now like the

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,250
three blocks on the home page you know

00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,730
it's got the slider image the three

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,829
blocks

00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,509
you know the call to actions you hover

00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:10,819
over one of those blocks and the image

00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:13,069
will kind of yeah it'll go turn black

00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:14,180
and white or you know it is black and

00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:16,039
white then when you have a rover it

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,140
bring it comes to life the color comes

00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,849
back you don't want to use two images

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,009
there you don't want to save a black and

00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:24,829
white image and a color image you want

00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:28,640
to just tell us with CSS hey on Mouse

00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:30,170
enter here on hover just desaturate the

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,450
photo turn a black and white that sort

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,299
of thing that makes sense

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,680
so don't over use Photoshop don't use

00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:40,339
too many images when you can get away

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:44,539
with it CSS overeat images that sort of

00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:50,930
stuff for effects etc open space for

00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:51,980
text we went over that overlays yeah and

00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:57,289
we went over the overlays with

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:59,809
semi-transparent colors yeah so I'll be

00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:04,700
honest that kind of brings us towards

00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:06,019
the end here I talk fast I apologize but

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,509
we'll go over here in a few minutes with

00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,210
some questions but yeah so I just wanted

00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:13,369
to bring up a website here and just have

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:19,039
you guys let me know on this site here

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:21,589
you know point out is where the PNG file

00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,020
is there's anything it's stand out here

00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:35,590
as being a particular PNG file

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:35,590
what's the PNG what's the JPEG I'm sorry

00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,270
the slaughter images are JPEGs but the

00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,240
logo however is a PNG file you'll see

00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,250
that it has kind of you know a

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,569
semi-transparent it's got kind of an

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,790
arch in the middle and that sort of

00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:52,190
thing so we use instead of you know

00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,630
saving a gif here I a gift would have

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:57,170
been a little bit lesser quality of an

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,730
image this logo is a PNG file and so

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,980
that brings up brings me to another

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:04,040
topic here how big should you make your

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,079
logo for your website do you want it to

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,829
be a thousand pixels wide you want to be

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,810
two thousand pixels wide you know to

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:15,290
answer that most of your themes will

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,940
resize them but again you start at the

00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:21,470
source you know you want your source to

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:23,200
be the appropriate size before it gets

00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:27,740
to your website

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,900
so most websites now are again most

00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,410
themes now are doing the you know the

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:36,380
retina conversion as well for you but

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,450
anywhere between five to eight hundred

00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,760
pixels wide is going to be a safe bet

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:44,750
for your to get a good sharp quality of

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,460
your logo your logo may have a

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,579
transparency so if it does you want to

00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,140
save a PNG file so again if it's a PNG

00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:53,750
file you might need two less than the

00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,550
dimension size because you might be

00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,400
getting you know your actual kilobytes

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,740
and your actual other size might be you

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,099
know getting closer to 500 that sort of

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:08,510
thing but so if you you know some themes

00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:12,700
and some websites if your logo is too

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:15,260
wide it will you know it will with CSS

00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,180
responsively resize that logo for you

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,800
but you may notice it looks a little bit

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:24,020
fuzzy and that's just due to the

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,700
rendering of most of the time usually

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,710
that came from the image being too small

00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,270
I'm being scaled up but a lot of times

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,060
now it's also coming from the image

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,670
being too large way too large and being

00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:38,150
scaled to scaled down and it's just the

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:40,280
the theme developers and the browser

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,930
just it's not doing a perfect job of

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,290
resizing that image so that's not

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:48,290
perfectly sharp so again if you just

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,530
start at the source and do things you

00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,980
know

00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,599
the quote-unquote I guess right way

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,760
there is no right way but the way that

00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:02,330
uh the wordpress currently likes it to

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:08,420
be Don you're gonna have better luck and

00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:13,040
so let's see go back to my slide that's

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:16,190
about it you may have you know one more

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,430
thing I want to bring up our CD ends you

00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:22,180
may have you know utilized cloud FEA

00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:26,000
CloudFlare or anything of that nature

00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,580
your host is also you know you want it's

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,830
an important factor in terms of your

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,500
image load times and you know how much

00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,950
your site can can take that sort of

00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,930
thing by and large most hosts the

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,349
general packages that you can get or

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,270
gonna cover you I mean there and when I

00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:45,349
say that I mean going with some of the

00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:50,750
bigger guys like GoDaddy

00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:52,760
Hostgator in motion they it in today's

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,349
time most of they're just standard

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,020
hosting packages are going to do the job

00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,660
we're gonna get you by again it's always

00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,010
smart to pay attention to what the

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,359
intended use of the website is you know

00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,950
loading a lot of images on a WooCommerce

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,750
site for example and if that will

00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,859
commerce site is running a sale thousand

00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,510
people are hitting the site trying to

00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,440
load those images you need to make sure

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:18,410
that your host is able to support that

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,940
and that's not necessarily always being

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,349
able to support a number of visitors

00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:25,099
it's also being able to support

00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:26,900
processes a number of other things so

00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:29,900
you know sometimes best to kind of

00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,450
consult with your host and let them know

00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,339
you know here's what we're gonna do we

00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:38,450
intend to have a lot of images on our

00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:40,369
website or not me at all and they will

00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,710
hopefully direct you in the right path

00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:45,859
and now a lot of times they will try to

00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,900
direct your upsell you to their

00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:51,800
preferred you know package of the month

00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,330
you know whatever they're selling that's

00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,050
a whole nother talk and hold another

00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,400
whole another discussion but in my

00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,500
opinion you can always get by with just

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,810
your cPanel Linux hosting it's worked

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,100
for fifteen twenty years

00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:08,690
and it's you know for most clients when

00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,260
you're passing off a website to a client

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,970
they want to pay for their own hosting

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,880
and just works both best for most of

00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:20,210
them this is just another example I have

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,610
up as a tab just you know another usage

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,490
of how you can use your images here this

00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:27,350
was a nice example I found where they it

00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,030
looked like they weren't able to they

00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,580
didn't want a hard cut it with a you

00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,410
know hard line but they also weren't

00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,510
able to make it full width so it looks

00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,750
like they have just a nice little gentle

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:42,500
fade gentle and subtle gradients are

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,030
coming back well I say subtle you're

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,770
seeing a lot more not so subtle

00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:50,660
gradients as of like the last year too

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:51,950
as well so don't be afraid to to you

00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:58,460
know play them up that sort of stuff as

00:44:51,950 --> 00:45:03,380
well yes ma'am I don't know how this

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:07,010
site did it how I would approach this so

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:10,400
I would if this were a a site through

00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:14,290
Divi or X I would have my element or my

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:18,220
Road built out column 1 column 2 and

00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:20,600
then I would have column 1 set

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,680
background layer 1 as the pattern

00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,330
background layer 2 okay scratch that

00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,160
background layer 1 is the pattern over

00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:31,280
here on the right column background

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:36,500
layer 1 as the image background layer 2

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,270
as the PNG as a faded PNG file to to

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,730
achieve this right here because it looks

00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:42,290
this is not a solid color this was a

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,840
solid color then we wouldn't have to use

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:47,330
a PNG file for this fade we could use

00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,830
CSS for the gradient fade but given that

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,590
it's a slight pattern and there's a

00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:54,619
gradient or some you know more detail

00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:56,210
here I would take this pattern here just

00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:59,300
fade it out a little bit make a little

00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:03,260
PNG strip and then just set that second

00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,150
layer background to float:left or not

00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,250
float:left but you know just be on the

00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,460
left side of that column that makes

00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,460
sense

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:18,630
oh so that would be done in Photoshop

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:21,040
Photoshop has you know an eraser tool

00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,680
they have like a hard eraser they have a

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,430
soft eraser you can control you know how

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,420
big the gradient is that sort of thing

00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,840
so that's something you can just YouTube

00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:40,480
you know how to have a user base for

00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:42,490
tool in Photoshop yes ma'am so I think

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:48,190
that's about everything I can rant about

00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:50,710
images with websites you know big no

00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:54,130
nose or you know you know using just

00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,600
giant images for your background I'm not

00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,730
gonna pull any examples up because I

00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,640
don't want to Sebastian a creative work

00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:01,960
but you know if you take a photo with

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,880
your iPhone and just use it as a

00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,570
background image it's probably not gonna

00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,560
look good you know

00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:12,910
so yeah again think out your photos

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,070
approach everything from the start you

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,420
know don't don't devote develop and

00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,650
design the site and then think about the

00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:22,270
photos later now I was always like to

00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:28,650
think about them like I said from the

00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:28,650
start so any questions yes sir

00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:43,090
so now you're getting into SEO so yeah

00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,700
good point though good point so yeah

00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:48,110
yeah so you know if you take it on your

00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,400
phone it's gonna be like I am gene a

00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,540
bunch of numbers

00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,220
yeah rename it to some keywords you know

00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,630
that that stuff is important then when

00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,730
you upload it into WordPress you know

00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,170
you have your media library and then you

00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,280
have the options a name you know you

00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,410
have the caption you have the

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,500
description fill that stuff out is

00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:08,810
appropriate that's all great stuff to

00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,090
fill out and it does does play a big

00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,750
role especially when you're talking like

00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:16,550
a website a week WooCommerce site with

00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:19,970
hundreds of product photos if all those

00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:23,540
photos are tagged appropriately Google

00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:27,590
loves that example Paco collars calm as

00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:29,090
a sighted it almost 10 years ago they

00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,920
started off very small they started

00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,720
they'd sort of building building custom

00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,630
leather dog collars and bark Berkeley

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,030
California got a WooCommerce site up

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,310
started and you know we design and

00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:43,460
develop their site from the get-go you

00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:45,260
know I think it was done nicely but what

00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,050
really made an impact was they took the

00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,640
site and they did everything right you

00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:53,390
know they uploaded photos the right size

00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:56,330
they tagged their photos with the right

00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,190
keywords and as a result when you search

00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,660
custom leather dog collars they were sat

00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,600
at the number one spot on google for

00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,280
almost a decade they're like two or

00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,750
three now I think because there's at sea

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,500
listings that are popping up and some

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:11,990
sponsored listings now that pop up but

00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:17,030
yeah keywords naming your files is

00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:19,210
important thank you for asking that yes

00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,210
ma'am

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:29,100
say that again oh absolutely just

00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,360
putting some keywords in there

00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:46,630
utilizing the fields that you have in

00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:48,670
your media library yes sir are you

00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,900
drawing these on paper and then putting

00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:56,650
them in the computer or are you trying

00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:59,770
to draw them in the computer you have

00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:04,960
like a tablet that you draw on that goes

00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:06,580
to the computer like a WAC okay so you

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,330
have a way you have a way to get it on

00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,210
the computer

00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,530
Photoshop would it be would be my

00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:13,660
suggestion there I mean unless you're

00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:15,910
trying to do you know clean line work

00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:22,840
and really you know illustrator is a

00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:25,120
great great option for that as well yeah

00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:28,270
yeah if you're doing you know very you

00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,440
know vector images you know which we

00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:32,590
didn't really touch on because we don't

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,150
use a lot of vector imagery we use SVG's

00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,380
occasionally but that's a totally

00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,420
different file type and we're not going

00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,130
to talk about those either

00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,550
they just load differently than your

00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:45,090
your standard images but yeah so if

00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:51,030
you're talking illustrations or whatnot

00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:51,030
illustrator absolutely yes ma'am

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,970
dynomite websites easier that Co

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:05,070
dynamite website Co and yeah I'm a

00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,140
freelance here in Nashville I didn't

00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,810
really talk a lot about myself but I've

00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,070
been doing this since high school was on

00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,320
the web team in high school

00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:15,360

00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,520
of high school moved out west took a

00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,070
couple years in college web development

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,240
but college drop out as soon as I

00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,780
realized I could make some money doing

00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,110
it

00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,560
I went headfirst into making money and

00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:31,050
now I have solely used WordPress and

00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:35,430
Photoshop as a tool to make a career

00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:37,770
over the last 10 years so for that I'm

00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:44,060
