Description: 
	In my 15 years of overall web dev experience, 10 years of direct WP work, I still see the same mistakes being made. Image sizes. In my opinion, this is one of the quickest ways to bring a great website to its demise. So Iâ€™d like to highlight the importance of web-sized and dimension photos, the impact it has on your hosting server, and how to better handle uploading pics moving forward.
Takeaways:
What images to use where
Image dimensions and sizes for websites
Server load and overall website processes attributed to loading images
