I came here after all all right well

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
welcome everybody thank you for coming

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,059
to this talk I appreciate you being here

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,060
on Sunday after lunch hopefully we'll

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,619
keep it Lively so you don't fall asleep

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,090
I also want to thank the organizers for

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,699
putting on this awesome event

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,050
it takes a lot and I appreciate all you

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,970
taking time out of your busy lives to

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,099
make this happen so thank you alright so

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,280
why are we here to talk about improving

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:40,020
the rankings of our websites using the

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:46,200
new Google search console so when it

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:49,079
comes to Google products they can often

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,610
feel quite overwhelming I mean I

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,340
remember the first time I jumped into

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,670
google analytics over a decade ago I was

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,859
like what is going on in here I was

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,120
totally out of my depth I couldn't

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,149
figure out what was going on there's so

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,830
many functions so many features and it

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,460
made it really challenging to figure it

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,180
out and as humans we're not really

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,000
adapted to deal with that many options

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,439
all right there in our face and when

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,020
that happens when we see all those

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,140
features all those functions what

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,680
happens a stress response happens our

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,330
eyes they send signals to our amygdala

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,390
that's that little lizard part of our

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,189
brain which says to our hypothalamus hey

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,880
sympathetic nervous system you need to

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,140
dump cortisol adrenaline norepinephrine

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,460
into the bloodstream so we can either

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,530
fight this or get out of here and when

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,500
that happens typically when it comes to

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,720
software we choose to take off we choose

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,149
a run away put it on the back burner

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,009
save it for another day but today what

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,509
we're going to be doing is giving you

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,990
the skills you need to let that stress

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:07,500
wash over you so that you can start

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,800
taking control of your rankings and how

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,560
you're appearing in search

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,080
and we're gonna do that by giving you

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,690
the knowledge you need to operate

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,970
comfortably within Google search console

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,560
make the most of the tools and reports

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,600
in there and make some really good

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,080
decisions with the insights that they're

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,030
giving you why because at the end of the

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,560
day when you improve your rankings

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,110
that's going to drive more qualified

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,430
traffic to your site hopefully that

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,890
qualified traffic is going to be

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,660
converting creating more revenue for you

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,700
or your clients so this talk is going to

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,440
be broken into three parts we have a lot

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,390
to cover today in an hour so I'm gonna

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,970
do my best to get to all of it and if

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,130
for some reason I don't or I don't

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,690
answer a question you had I'm gonna head

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,930
over towards the happiness bar after

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,580
this so feel free to come bug me and

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,530
I'll answer whatever Google search

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,360
console questions you have as I

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,970
mentioned lots of features lots and

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,350
cover so here's how we're gonna break it

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,320
down we're gonna start by talking about

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,610
the proper set up if you're not set up

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,500
properly you're not going to be dealing

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,090
with the best data possible you're not

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,470
going to be able to get those really

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,959
quality insights that are gonna allow

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,970
you to take action then we're gonna dive

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,860
into the most useful tools and reports

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,870
that are really going to help you

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,670
improve your rankings we're not gonna

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,130
get into absolutely every little

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,920
function in there but the most important

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,240
ones for you to know how to use and then

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,550
we're going to talk about some actual

00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,890
tactics some optimization improvement

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,770
tactics that you can walk away from here

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:44,480
today with go home and actually start

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:46,010
using for you and your clients and let's

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,030
talk about why Google search console

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,580
exists so it allows us to monitor

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,700
maintained in troubleshoot how our sites

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,440
are performing in Google and that's huge

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,020
because Google is showing us what it

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,940
knows about our sites and it's allowing

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,280
us to communicate it with it and tell it

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,320
what we want to know what we want it to

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,720
know about our sites they're giving us

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,840
data back that we can then go use to

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,400
improve how we're performing and so

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,050
looking at the history of search console

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,050
had started off as webmaster tools

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,960
Google started adding a bunch of

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,080
features to it and became Google search

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,319
console it was still the same

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,900
platform and then in 2017 Google

00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,030
released a beta version of the new

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,889
Google search console which is a totally

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,919
different interface much better user

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,020
experience much improved a lot of the

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,080
features are the same as the old Google

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,500
search console but some of them have not

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,479
yet been migrated and here's a list of

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,490
the features that were in the old Google

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,889
search console that have not quite made

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,169
it over to the new one with that being

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,840
said we do expect to see most of these

00:04:53,169 --> 00:05:01,840
migrated in the near future hopefully so

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,710
let's dive into what a proper Google

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,740
search console setup looks like and so

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,840
as I mentioned if we don't properly set

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,430
up Google search console we're gonna not

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,650
be dealing with the best data possible

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,509
and therefore we're not going to be able

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,000
to take the right actions that we need

00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:22,560
to be taking to improve our search

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,360
results and so in order to establish

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,789
that line of communication between you

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,729
and Google what you need to do is verify

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:33,039
your site and Google gives you two

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,759
options to verify your site using your

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,060
domain or using the URL prefix now the

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,270
domain verification is a relatively new

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,639
feature but what it allows you to do is

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,539
upload a text file to your domain

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,849
hosting provider and put it in put that

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:54,099
text file in the DNS records and that's

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,750
gonna allow Google to see every version

00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,699
of your site associated with that

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,810
particular domain and that's really

00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,690
helpful because it's gonna give you the

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,360
most comprehensive view of all the

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,699
versions of your site that exists so if

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,289
you can I highly recommend you start by

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,740
verifying your sites or your clients

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,449
sites using domain first and if you

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,430
can't verify using the domain if you

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,849
don't have access to your domain host

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,319
you can use the URL prefix and this is

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,000
where you're gonna plug in the canonical

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,839
version or the definitive version of

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,120
your site so if it's HTTP dub dub dub

00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,729
you want to make sure that that's the

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,709
exact version you put in there so that

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,669
you're focusing on that definitive

00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:37,259
version of your site

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:40,030
and Google's give you data about that

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,430
that being said Google also wants you to

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,749
include all versions when you're

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,930
verifying using the URL prefix so

00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:52,449
include just the HTTP no dubs the HTTP

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,159
google asks for all of those but the

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,099
most important one to get in there is

00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:00,129
the definitive version or like I

00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,680
recommended to start use the domain

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,919
verification that's gonna make it easy

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,439
and simplify everything for you next

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,479
thing you want to do is add permissions

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,969
so this is going to give other people on

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,669
your team's or your clients access to go

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,539
in here and look at what's going on

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:19,539
there's three different levels of

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:22,300
permissions owner full user and

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,219
restricted owner has access to

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,339
everything they can look at all data and

00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:31,089
take all actions add more users full

00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:34,889
users can see all data and take most

00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:37,539
actions and restricted can just see data

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,279
if you're working with a large team or

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,409
you have a lot of people who want access

00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,750
be careful giving out those owner

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,339
permissions that can get a little bit

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,229
exciting

00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,259
and add to a lot of confusion if you

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,639
just give those out willy-nilly one

00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,189
other thing we recommend you do is

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,750
connect it to your Google Analytics this

00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,939
is gonna allow you to see your Google

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,279
search console insights your performance

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,889
in search console directly within

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,659
analytics and that means you can go into

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,419
the analytics and not have to jump back

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,580
and forth between Google search console

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,259
and analytics to see that information

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,259
it's going to be right there in your

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,639
acquisition report showing you how

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,460
you're getting traffic from organic

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,469
search and you can do that by going into

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,169
Google Analytics clicking on settings

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,849
and go into the admin using that

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,490
property column the view in the middle

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,460
and selecting all products finding

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,050
search console and then linking the to

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,820
Google will walk you through a dialog

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:38,890
that will allow you to connect those the

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,969
last thing you need to do for a proper

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,920
set up is submit a clean XML sitemap and

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,480
what this is going to do is tell Google

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,400
all the pages on your site

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,920
that you want it to know about and you

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,680
want it to show in search results and so

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,470
a clean sitemap means that your XML

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,380
sitemap is free of thin and duplicate

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,300
content thin content being content that

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,680
doesn't really add any values for users

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,650
it doesn't make the internet a better

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,300
place it's like leftover theme files or

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,880
pages with nothing on them so make sure

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,350
all of that is remove for your from your

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,840
sitemap before you submit it to Google

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,760
and duplicate content that's the exact

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,950
same content living underneath two

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,240
different URLs you want to make sure

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:28,030
that you add canonical tags if you have

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,860
that happening from those nonde from the

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,240
non definitive content to the canonical

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,550
version and then also make sure just the

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,370
canonical content the definitive version

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,840
of that content that URL is what's in

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,580
your sitemap so the four actions you

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,280
need to take to properly set up Google

00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,620
search console your gonna verify your

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,570
site ideally using that domain

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,360
verification then you're gonna add

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,310
permissions being careful of who you

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,150
give those ownership permissions to if

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,620
you have a lot of users you can connect

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,720
it to Google Analytics if your going to

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,190
find that to be helpful and then find

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,100
that information in acquisition and

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:13,270
finally submit that clean sitemap for

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,470
you thin and duplicate content so now

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,340
let's get into what some of the most

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,710
useful tools and reports within the new

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,510
version of Google search console are so

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,980
when you sign into the new version of

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,810
Google search console for the first time

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,310
this is what you're going to see if for

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,780
some reason you don't see this left-hand

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,000
menu just hit that little hamburger up

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,410
top that's gonna pop it out for you but

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,210
this is gonna be your overview page

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,790
which is essentially your dashboard

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,500
you're gonna have a little synopsis of

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,990
your performance report your coverage

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,300
report and what's cutoff right here is

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,520
your enhancements report down at the

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,260
bottom so that's going to be a snapshot

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,300
of how each of those are doing at any

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,980
given point in time and then you have

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,570
all the different functionalities which

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,690
we're going to dive into over here in

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,649
the menu on top of your url inspection

00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,110
tool which

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,899
talk about and then also your little

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,110
help icon question mark over there in

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,579
the top right the first thing you want

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,699
to do when you jump in here is make sure

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:12,069
you pick the right property we once had

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,959
a client call us and they were a little

00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,279
bit freaked out because they thought all

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,429
of their organic traffic could

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,230
completely fallen off the map come to

00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:22,449
find out we start talking to him find

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,179
out they're in search console but they

00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:27,610
were just looking at the wrong property

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,110
everything was fine and so they had a

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,879
little heart attack for no reason just

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,339
because they're looking at the wrong

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,920
property start by selecting the right

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:40,679
property up there in the top left hand

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:44,079
corner so if you want to be seen

00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:48,129
information for HTTPS dub-dub-dub

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,740
pointer pointer com make sure it's HTTPS

00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:56,920
dub-dub-dub version that you're looking

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:59,050
at in your properties all right so let's

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,850
talk about what that URL inspection tool

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,699
is up top and what it's going to do for

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,189
you first of all it's gonna tell you if

00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,319
a page on your site or the URL if that

00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:11,350
is actually in Google's index if Google

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,759
knows about that page it's gonna tell

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,920
you how we will figure it out about that

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,980
page whether you submit it in your

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,629
sitemap or discover date using links

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,959
elsewhere on the web when it was last

00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:25,990
crawled if it's probably able to be

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,629
properly indexed and importantly if it's

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,790
mobile-friendly I'll talk about this a

00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:32,889
couple times in this talk but Google

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,860
crawls everything as if it were a mobile

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,860
device first so all of your pages have

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,329
to be mobile-friendly and if it's not

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,949
Google's going to tell you about it

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,490
right there when you plug in a

00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:46,660
particular URL into the inspection tool

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,189
another great feature about the

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,439
inspection tool is your ability to

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:52,689
request indexing and that's what I have

00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:54,399
in that little box on the top right any

00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,499
time you're making changes to your

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,699
content on your site you improve your

00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:00,490
content and you want Google to know

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:02,470
about it come in here throw that URL in

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,209
the inspection tool and then click on

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,699
request indexing that's going to send

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,050
Google Google's crawlers right out to

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,149
recrawl your content

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:16,149
and make sure it's properly indexed in

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:18,249
its newest latest form so you can use

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,519
that URL inspection to see if your pages

00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,989
are in the index individual pages if the

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,540
pages can be crawled if they're

00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:27,459
mobile-friendly you'll also be able to

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,069
identify and fix errors that Google is

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:32,499
found with those individual pages and

00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:35,290
lastly use that feature to request

00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:42,660
indexing now once you've made changes to

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:45,129
your content it's usually pretty quick

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,439
and it depends on how much other stuff

00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,239
Google I was going on like what else is

00:13:47,439 --> 00:14:05,139
trying to crawl but it's usually same

00:13:49,239 --> 00:14:06,759
day so yes sir all right so the next

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,059
piece of this do you've a question over

00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,059
there sir

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,100
you don't need to do it once a month

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,550
only when you're making changes to your

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,550
content

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,260
yeah the easier thing to do would be if

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,710
they're making a lot of changes resubmit

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,720
your site Mac on a regular basis the XML

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,640
sitemap that would be my recommendation

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,770
there all right let's talk about what

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,420
these enhancements are so the

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,950
enhancements reports are going to look

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,300
different for everybody so everybody's

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,580
search console is gonna look different

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,070
underneath enhancements well everybody's

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,510
going to see mobile usability but it's

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,580
going to depend on which kind of what

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,860
elements of your site are optimized for

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,630
rich results and those elements of your

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,340
site that are optimized for rich results

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,420
this is where Google's gonna report on

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,840
those and tell you how they're

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,840
performing in search so it depends on

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,640
how many of those you have on your site

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,410
that's what you're gonna be able to see

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,120
in access here I'm not gonna get into

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,850
this too much in depth today because it

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,890
is so diverse depending on every site

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,620
but that's what this report is looking

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:32,000
at the one I did mention is

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,560
mobile-friendly um so when you're in

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,510
there mobile usability underneath

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,460
enhancements that's going to tell you

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,920
how many of your pages Google to seen as

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,840
mobile-friendly and how many are not

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,580
right now this is 15 pages are

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,830
mobile-friendly zero or not

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,110
mobile-friendly this is a good place to

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,840
get that aggregate view of how your site

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,480
as a whole is on a mobile-friendly basis

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,980
so go in here and make sure all your

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,000
pages are mobile-friendly if you want

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,390
them appearing in search next let's talk

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,850
about security and manual actions right

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:08,900
underneath that what is this so what our

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,720
manual actions manual actions are when

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,400
Google goes and crawls the pages on your

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,100
site and sees you doing something

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:20,840
sketchy or in Google's words something

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,970
shady here's a long list of shady

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,050
actions that you can take that are doing

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,520
get a manual action flagged in Google

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,650
search console and when this happens

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,210
typically Google's crawlers will see

00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,280
something sketchy going on on your site

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,690
and then it'll have one of its employees

00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,029
take a look at it they'll say yep that

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,569
shady so we're gonna take a manual

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:44,699
action pull that out of search results

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:47,339
so it can be any of these things you

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,750
know cloaking scraped content that's

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,649
when you take content from other sites

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:55,110
put it on yours abusing Rich Snippets

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,819
sketchy links so Google can see a lot of

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,560
that stuff so the bottom line is dumpy

00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:01,050
shady and you should never have a

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,269
problem these are rare if you're if

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,339
you're just operating a business and

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,839
you're not trying to manipulate search

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,789
results you'll probably never see a

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,679
manual action so you don't need to worry

00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,949
about these too much but in the event

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,720
you do you can find out more about it

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,299
Google will tell you what's going on in

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,309
this report you can go fix the issue and

00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,679
then request a review so that it will

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:26,329
remove the flag and you'll be able to

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,309
get that page back in search results and

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,049
Google is also able to see security

00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,030
issues on your site when it's crawling

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,309
it and so there's all sorts of different

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,039
issues it can see malware on your site

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,539
on hacked pages social engineering

00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,309
attacks there's a lot of things that can

00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:44,280
is able to identify when it's crawling

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:47,010
and when it sees those it will notify

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,510
you in your security issues it's also

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,270
gonna give you information about how to

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,309
go fix those and then you can fix them

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,500
come back in here and a request a review

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:57,510
to let Google know that these pages are

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,110
good to go there's no security issues

00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,820
anymore

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,929
and they can continue to appear in

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,510
search results so hopefully we never see

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,640
anyone with manual actions or security

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,309
issues in an ideal world that would be

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,270
the case one very basic security issue I

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,980
want to make sure all of you are

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,390
addressing and all you have all

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,870
addressed for your clients is making

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:22,440
sure they're switched over to the HTTPS

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:24,059
protocol if they're still on HTTP it's

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,549
not doing them any favors in search

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,710
results and there will be a little boost

00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:31,080
in rankings their ability to rank if

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,909
they do switch over so Singhal that

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,500
little SEO care in front of them if

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:36,179
they're resistant to making the switch

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,190
if they don't want to investment or

00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,590
whatever tell them that it's going to

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:44,179
improve their way there their site is

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,179
able to appear in search

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,419
so now let's dive into the coverage

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,909
report and when it comes to coverage

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:56,990
what we're talking about is technical

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:59,000
SEO this is Google telling us what it

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,269
knows about the pages on our site and

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,159
how it has 'm catalogued within its

00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:08,659
index essentially and so you can access

00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,370
the coverage report in two different

00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,759
places within the new search console

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,350
right up there in the top left or you're

00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,029
also going to see the snapshot of how

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,840
your coverage is performing how many of

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:23,659
your pages have the valid indexation

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,149
status you can click report or open

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:30,350
report in that as well to access this

00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:32,269
coverage report and so coverage as I

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,950
mentioned is Google telling us what he

00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:38,649
knows about our pages which are

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,649
appearing in search and which are not

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,779
and let's take a step back for a second

00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:48,799
and talk about how Google indexes stuff

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,840
and what indexation actually is so when

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,529
it comes to indexation I like to think

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,820
of the metaphor of a library in this

00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:02,029
instance the library is the web Google

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,820
is a librarian the index is a card

00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:07,279
catalog the information Google has about

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,159
each one of our pages is one of those

00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,940
cards in the card catalog and the books

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,940
are all of our webpages and so when a

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,220
searcher goes into the library or when a

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,039
search it goes into the web and they go

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,580
up to Google and say hey can I have the

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,590
best book on this particular topic

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,110
Google's gonna go to his index that card

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,120
catalog and it's going to consult all

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,169
the information it has about that

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,830
particular topic

00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,379
and it's gonna see which of the pages is

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,110
the best which book it has it is the

00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:44,539
best on that topic it's gonna go and get

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,269
that book or that page and return it to

00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:49,549
the search the searcher or the library

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:52,549
patron so when you're trying to think

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:54,860
about how the index works Google try to

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,309
think of that metaphor I find it to help

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,720
simplify things

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,730
and one thing to keep in mind is that

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,280
Google's not indexing websites as a

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,970
whole and ranking those in search

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,820
results

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,600
it's indexing and ranking the individual

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,309
pages on our sites and so as a result

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,010
each one of those pages has an ability

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:18,500
to perform in search not our website as

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,690
a whole sure our homepage can perform

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,600
and Google will index a but not our

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,990
website as a whole that is unless your

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,320
site is a single page like the best

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,470
dinosaur com in that case Google would

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:39,559
index your website as a whole because

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:42,620
it's one page so within the coverage

00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:46,419
report it's broken down into two main

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,490
sections in type indexation statuses

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:55,730
presented in a chart and then a details

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:58,280
read and reasons table below that and in

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,559
order to show these indexation statuses

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,480
you have to make sure each one of them

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,789
is highlighted so each one of those

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,330
rectangles up there you have to click on

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,789
it to highlight it and chart it and then

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:15,200
also show the details about that

00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:17,929
indexation status in the table below the

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,120
details and reasons table as you can see

00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:22,940
we have our index station statuses here

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,299
on the left-hand side and for each one

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,830
there can be multiple types of reasons

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:33,470
that indexation status is what it is if

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,210
we have issues google's them to let us

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,400
know if you've started the validation

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,210
process on those issues and it's also

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,390
going to show us how many pages are

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:47,049
marked with a particular type of

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,049
indexation status

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,020
and let's just take Airds for example

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,420
and so if we were to click errors that

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,310
would show the details about the errors

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,210
were experiencing here we have submitted

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:07,150
URL not found we can then click on that

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,610
type of error to get into a coverage

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,760
drill down report so this is where

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,070
Google is telling us how many pages have

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,350
that submitted URL not found error

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,320
occurring on them here we only have one

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,270
instance so we only have one page listed

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,210
down here in the examples if we had

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,520
multiple pages those would all be listed

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,850
there in examples and we could click on

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,320
those pages and Google's gonna pop out

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,990
this little toolbar on the right hand

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,360
saw on the right hand side and give us

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,570
some tools to work with to figure out

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,970
why that particular page is marked that

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,480
way will allow us to go and inspect that

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,940
URL and test it out and then that will

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,150
give us more information about why that

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,150
page is marked submitted URL not found

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,500
and so let's talk about what some of

00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,180
these different indexation statuses are

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:06,970
to help clarify that a little bit so

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,920
errors these are issues Google is having

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,610
with the pages on your site that are

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:15,340
preventing those pages from appearing in

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:18,310
search results you need to fix these

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,170
errors before the pages associated with

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:23,140
them are actually going to appear in

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,690
search results so we highlight that see

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,840
what errors are occurring and then

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,280
ideally go fix those pages

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:36,640
the next status is valid with warning

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,440
and these are pages that may are likely

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,730
appearing in search results but Google

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,140
is taking issue with them for some

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,240
reason and wants you to go and prove

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,220
them it says hey you can be doing better

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,990
here and it's going to tell you what you

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,480
can do to actually improve those pages

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,470
so now all the birth warning is the

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,110
second one over there and both with your

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,300
errors and your valid with warning take

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,170
action by going out and fixing whatever

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,360
issues Google is telling you about

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,570
in order to do that here's the process

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,250
you can follow so once you have your

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,250
heirs or your valid with warning

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,260
highlighted you can click down to get to

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,840
the cup the coverage drill down report

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,520
and once you're in this cover drill down

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,880
report you can start by learning more

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,030
about what that actual error is or why a

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,880
valid with warning issue is occurring

00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,750
and do that by clicking on learn more

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,429
that's going to take you straight to

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,160
Google's documentation where it's going

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,470
to say hey this is what's happening this

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,080
is what a submitted URL not found is and

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:43,040
why it's occurring as I mentioned you're

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,049
gonna have the actual pages listed down

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,809
underneath examples so the second step

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,820
is to click in your pages and then see

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,559
what tools Google's giving you on the

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,660
left on the right hand side there to

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,360
investigate and you want to go

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,000
investigate those pages use the tools

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,700
google gives you to figure out why that

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,309
issue is occurring once you've figured

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,140
out what that issue is by learning more

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,540
and why it's occurring by using those

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,710
those tools to investigate it you're

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,160
gonna fix the issue

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:15,559
once you fix the issue come back in here

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,350
to the coverage report validate the fix

00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,150
the final step right there and that's

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,919
going to tell Google that you fix the

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,630
issue you can go crawl and check the

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,510
work you've done to make sure it is

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:37,940
resolved and so that's for both your

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:39,740
errors and your valid with warning no no

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,590
issue there yeah Google will just tell

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,390
you to redo it so SEO jargon and things

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,090
in Google support can sometimes get a

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,860
little bit technical here's some tools

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:55,160
helpful tools you can use to make sense

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,419
of all that starting with were more like

00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I was saying that that's a really

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,140
helpful function it's gonna take you

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,330
straight to Google's documentation where

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,330
it's gonna make sense of the issue that

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,429
is occurring next I want you to use

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,740
these little question mark icons within

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:12,020
Google search console to figure out

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,710
what's going on that little question

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,690
mark ice

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,940
icon is gonna tell you what's happening

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,770
with the different elements within

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,270
search console that's gonna help you

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,220
make sense of the functionalities that

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,100
you're looking at and what all of these

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,380
functionalities do also don't be afraid

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,960
to use a help icon on the top right hand

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,179
corner that's gonna take you straight to

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,640
Google's documentation related to the

00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:36,350
exact page you're on it's extremely

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,870
intuitive so if we're looking at

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,940
submitted URL mark no Index Google's

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:45,080
gonna take us directly to that in its

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,480
documentation it's help documentation

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,220
when we click on that question mark icon

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,880
another really helpful resource is a Moz

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,340
Learning Center or just going to Moz and

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,790
typing in whatever terms you're

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,250
questioning within Google say Mark no

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,620
Index you can type that in to search in

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,419
moz.com and it's going to give you

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,080
information either in its learning

00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:15,650
center right here or in the Moz SEO

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,050
glossary and so that's another place you

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,690
can start to make sense of what some of

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,629
these SEO terms are and these technical

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,580
ideas are

00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:28,249
also don't be afraid to google it I

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,919
often see people never think to do this

00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:33,200
step in the process but just copy

00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,059
exactly what Google's telling you so in

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,850
this instance submitted your El mark no

00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:41,210
index I'd copy that from Google paste it

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,789
into or from Google search console paste

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,470
it into Google and see what kind of

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:47,450
information I get back there's

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,159
definitely gonna be some videos some

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,509
forms and some articles telling you

00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,950
exactly how you can go fix that issue so

00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:56,749
very straightforward step to take there

00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,259
maybe do that first

00:28:56,749 --> 00:29:02,210
that might simplify things okay there's

00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:06,860
two more indexation statuses we did not

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:09,559
discuss valid and these are a success

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,830
these are the pages on your site that

00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,419
are appearing in search results 138

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,200
pages here are appearing in search

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:21,529
results and we see how Google found out

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,789
of items submitted and indexed and if

00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:25,789
they're just index but they weren't

00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,940
submitted in our sitemap those are pages

00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:31,820
that have found about using links out

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,039
there on the web most likely so these

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,169
are pages that are in search these are a

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:38,929
win for you as long as they are pages

00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:40,519
that you don't want in search so make

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,590
sure none of your pages that you don't

00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:46,129
want in search have found their way in

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:49,220
here to be marked as valid I'm also

00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:53,149
monitor this report for any spikes or

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:56,480
drops which can index a which can denote

00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:58,639
indexation issues so spikes are drops

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,720
and make sure no sneaky pages you want

00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:06,759
excluded are in there and the final type

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,759
of indexation status yes sir

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,580
yep you just click on it and that's

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,040
going to take you right to that coverage

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,080
dildo drill down report where it's going

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,550
to show you all the examples and those

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,730
are all the pages that are going to be

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:30,850
indexed those are yes they will show you

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,810
those pages that were not in the sitemap

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,320
excluded these are pages that are

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,510
intentionally hopefully excluded from

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,210
Google search results and there's all

00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:44,120
sorts of reasons that Google will

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,340
exclude pages from search results and

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,010
hopefully that you excluded pages from

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,590
search results and you will see a lot of

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:54,560
those here make sure none of your the

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,120
pages that you want marked as valid in

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,670
search console have found their way into

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,820
excluded that means they're not going to

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:04,130
show up also make sure you fix your 404

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:09,020
words with redirects same thing goes for

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:11,060
soft 404s when it comes to coverage I

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,650
like to think of this a place for

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,020
everything and everything in this place

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,210
when everything's in its place in our

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,640
coverage report Google is going to be

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,730
able to make sense of it and properly

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:27,530
display all of our pages in search

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,330
results and so that's our goal so here's

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:33,020
what you can do to take action with the

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:35,270
coverage report fix pages that have

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,300
errors pages that are marked valid with

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,760
warning ensure all your valid pages

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,890
should actually be valid and those

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,340
sneaky pages you want excluded are

00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,710
showing up as valid and then make sure

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,740
none of your pages on the flip side that

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:56,870
you want appearing in search have been

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:59,120
marked as excluded and then finally use

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,920
some of those tools I mentioned Google

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,160
it use moz.com

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,960
and don't be afraid to to use Google's

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,940
documentation with the in search console

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,000
to learn more about why things are the

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,310
way they are

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,560
all right so next let's talk about

00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:16,720
performance and I love performance we're

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,490
talking about technical SEO with

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,210
coverage we're talking about on-site

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:24,370
optimization with our performance and

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,700
you can access it up there in the top

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,450
left or by clicking on open report in

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,370
your Cobra view and so the performance

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,370
report is going to quantify how our

00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:38,320
pages are performing in search results

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,050
for whatever given period of time we

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,960
have selected which can be up to 16

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,970
months with the new search console and

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,190
in the words Grace Hopper an accurate

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:51,670
measurement is worth a thousand expert

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:55,120
opinions and Google is telling us what

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,730
it knows so this is data directly from

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,800
Google it's kind of the best we have it

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,930
and that's why SEO is love Google search

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,860
console so much is because this is

00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,540
straight from the horse's mouth so when

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,980
it comes to the performance report when

00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,540
we click into that this is what we're

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,510
gonna see and it's broken down into

00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,690
three main sections we have our filters

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:22,480
of top our metrics and then our

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:25,600
dimensions and so let's start by talking

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,580
about our filters and sorry I'll pop

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,350
back our filters appear in two different

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,720
places so up top and there's also this

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:38,220
little sneaky filters over there where

00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,220
we can sort by queries and our metrics

00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,150
but we have three types of filters that

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,310
are going to allow us to sort our data

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:48,100
within the performance report so our

00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,870
search type our date and then we can

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,430
search by the I mean sort by the

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,680
different dimensions that we have

00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,300
available so search type is that's the

00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,220
other going to be web searches image

00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,890
searches or video searches those are

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,260
three options there our date can go all

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:05,020
the way up to 16 months ago and that can

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,580
also allow us to compare two date ranges

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,560
to one another to see how we're

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,590
performing in search over two different

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,260
periods of time and then we can add our

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,880
dimensions our queries which are the

00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,370
keywords our site is getting found for

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,840
or our pages are getting found for the

00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,760
pages those are our pages on our site

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,810
the country where people are searching

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,000
for us

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,590
or or rally where people are searching

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,350
for the terms that were appearing in

00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,820
search results for and then devices what

00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:37,790
kind of devices are using to search

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:39,320
desktop mobile devices or tablets and

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,740
then as I was saying down in that little

00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,560
sneaky filters in the dimensions table

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:50,480
you can sort by queries and then also

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:52,910
your metrics and so our metrics are

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,090
right there in the middle and they're in

00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,590
that chart and when it comes to our

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,080
metrics they operate very much the same

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,390
way our indexation statuses did in the

00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,280
coverage report you have to highlight

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,520
each one of those rectangles click on it

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,300
until it is terms of color to chart it

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,940
and then also for it to show up over

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,250
here in the dimensions table you can see

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,170
our clicks impressions CTR and position

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,770
all four of those are showing up because

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,150
all four of those are highlighted if we

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,980
clicked average position and D

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,090
highlighted it position would disappear

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:32,540
from that table and so what are our

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,490
metrics so these are what enable us to

00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,710
measure how we're appearing in search

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,390
and total clicks is how many people are

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,840
actually clicking through to our site

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:45,950
from search results total impressions

00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,590
are how many times our site or our pages

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,840
are appearing in search results average

00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:53,630
click-through rate is the percentage of

00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,830
those times it appeared in search what

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,050
percentage of the time did people

00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:59,270
actually click through to our site an

00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:02,660
average position that's an average of

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:05,270
where we're appearing in search so

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:09,020
that's our ranking is the easiest way to

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:11,000
think about that and this information

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,650
automatically is aggregated for our

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,450
entire site so although google has

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,240
information for every single one of our

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,230
pages it aggregates all that information

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,510
right here automatically in the

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,650
performance report so when you go in

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,570
there for the first time that's what

00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,890
you're looking at if you add a page as a

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,600
filter you'll be looking at that

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:34,070
information for a particular page let's

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,350
talk about what's going on in our

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,060
dimensions table

00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:41,680
down here so we have a few different

00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:45,340
dimensions starting with queries so

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,470
queries are on the far left here those

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,870
are the search terms or the keywords

00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,960
that we are being discovered for in

00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:54,670
search results our pages are going to

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,950
give us information about how each one

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,560
of our pages on our site are appearing

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,880
in search results countries once again

00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,520
that's where people are searching for

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,610
the keywords related to our our site

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,530
where we're actually appearing in search

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,690
the devices the devices are using and

00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,370
searching parents that's gonna give you

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,190
information about how you're appearing

00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:17,260
in rich results and that's not available

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:22,090
for everybody if for some reason you

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,530
don't have elements that are able to

00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,530
appear in rich results that might not

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,510
appear in here but in order to use the

00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,190
dimensions table you're gonna click on

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,170
queries for example and that's gonna

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,530
list all the queries that your site is

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,510
showing up for in search so if we did

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,360
that now to aggregate all those queries

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,670
together for all the pages on our site

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,470
and give us information for that site as

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,020
a whole so these are all the keywords

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,450
that site is performing for you can also

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,310
see rows per page by default that's

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,560
gonna be 10 it can often be helpful to

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,360
drop it down to 25 or 50 when you're

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,030
looking at this I think it goes up to

00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,860
250 but often that much can be

00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:04,090
overwhelming 25 is probably a good place

00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,610
to start and when we're looking at the

00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:09,430
performance report we also like to

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:12,250
recommend that people use 12 months of

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:15,430
data that's kind of like the best D the

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:18,910
best date range to work with Google by

00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,990
default will show you 3 months but 12 is

00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,500
going to give you a little bit more of a

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,600
holistic picture and so when we're

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,450
looking at our queries dimension we can

00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,340
see that for half the guide service 14

00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,780
people clicked through to our site from

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:37,120
search it was shown our site was shown

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,350
297 times in the or pages from our site

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,930
were showing 297 times in search results

00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:47,650
4.7 percent of those 297 people clicked

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:51,340
through to it and on average those pages

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:55,510
ranked 1.5 for that particular search

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:57,700
term or keyword and if we are able and

00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,950
if we clicked over the pages that's

00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:04,030
gonna list all our pages sorted by

00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,070
clicks by default high to low and that's

00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,340
going to show us which of our pages are

00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,810
performing the best in search how many

00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,450
impressions are getting how many times

00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,760
they've appeared in search and all those

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,170
other good metrics right there you can

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,730
click over to impressions or

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,170
click-through rate if you want to sort

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,170
using those metrics yes

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,080
typically you're looking for a lower

00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,240
number because if your ranking position

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,670
1 they're gonna be at the very top 1

00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,520
through 10 is first page 11 to 20 you're

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,630
looking at second page and anything

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,880
below that you'll probably not get you

00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,390
found but that being said remember that

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,380
this is aggregate data most of the time

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:48,490
or actually when we're looking at our

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,740
pages it's not so this page asking dad

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,560
service our home page is performing

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:57,040
position 26.1 but that's for a ton of

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,960
different queries and until you added a

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,240
particular query as a filter you

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,820
wouldn't know the exact performance of

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,830
that page for a particular keyword so

00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,440
that's why all these all this filtering

00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:11,190
is extremely helpful here in search

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,190
console yes

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,960
you would do that up top and we'll take

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,640
a look at how you how you can do that a

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,740
little bit let's get into some of this

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,750
improvement and optimization because

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,370
this has been a little bit dry if we've

00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,080
been poking around giving you a lay of

00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:31,360
the land but here's some actual stuff

00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:36,010
you can go home and do to improve the

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:38,800
way you're ranking so I imagine a lot of

00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:41,980
you have selected a focus keyword and

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,780
plugged it into Yoast and then hopefully

00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,820
your content is performing for that

00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,910
focus keyword that happens all the time

00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,460
but even the best most seasoned se owes

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,220
don't select the best focused keyword

00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,690
right off the bat and so as a result

00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,450
what we can do is come into our

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,670
performance report and find a better

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,460
focus keyword or find out if our

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:07,240
original focus keyword is performing the

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,460
way we want it to so we're gonna start

00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,850
by highlighting all of our metrics so

00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,890
that we have all the information about

00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,930
our pages and so what we're doing here

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,690
we're trying to see if for an individual

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,420
page we have the best focus keyword

00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,470
possible and then so once those are

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,630
highlighted it's going to show us our

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,200
metrics we're gonna click on pages in

00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:31,150
the dimensions table what's that what

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,550
that's gonna do is gonna show us all the

00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:36,610
pages on our site and how they are

00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:39,070
performing based on clicks by default

00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,130
and so let's take this one for example

00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:44,740
the second one down this is an article

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,240
about XML sitemaps for WordPress you see

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,400
has had nine hundred and seventy-seven

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,860
clicks one hundred and eighty thousand

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,390
impressions and it's ranking 30.4

00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:58,900
because that's for all the different

00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:01,240
keywords that that shows up in search

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,770
results for so sometimes they might show

00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,750
up number one sometimes it might show up

00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:10,420
number one hundred but when we click on

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,280
that page so if we're in our pages in

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,450
dimensions if we actually click on that

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,349
page that's gonna automatically

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:22,190
as a filter up top this is that page at

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,920
it is a filter and once it's added is a

00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,140
filter we can click back over to queries

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,440
to see all the keywords that that page

00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,270
is performing for and we see that this

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,059
particular article is performing the

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:37,579
best for Yoast SEO sitemap yo sitemap

00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:39,200
and sitemap Yoast those are keywords

00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:42,740
that are driving and clicks and

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,809
impressions and so that means Google

00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,020
likes our piece of content for those

00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:50,000
particular keywords however something

00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,369
tells me that that wasn't the actual

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,790
focus keyword that we wanted that piece

00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:58,220
of content to perform for we originally

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:01,400
take the XML sitemap for WordPress as

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:06,049
our focus keyword but when we were just

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,700
looking at that data in the queries XML

00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:10,730
sitemap for WordPress doesn't show up

00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,859
anywhere Google doesn't like that piece

00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,559
of content for that particular focus

00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:17,750
keyword it likes it for XML sitemap but

00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,130
kind of in a 4th page rankings kind of

00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,319
way which doesn't really do us all that

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:25,400
much good when you did is sending some

00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,200
traffic in clicks but what we do know is

00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,980
that Google does really like this

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,880
article for Yoast SEO sitemap and so we

00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,599
can use that insight to go improve our

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,030
focus keyword on that page and so what

00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,059
we would do is substitute our keyword

00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:47,839
that is not performing for a new keyword

00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:51,920
that is performing already or that that

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,849
article is performing well for and when

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,270
we do that Google is much more likely to

00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:03,589
say oh hey this article is about Yoast

00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:06,589
SEO site sitemaps even more now because

00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:09,290
we were sending it stronger signals that

00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:15,349
this that's what we want this particular

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:17,660
article to be ranked for and so when you

00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:21,440
switch out focus keywords in your

00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:24,510
content what you can do is put them in

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,810
the title tag your meta description

00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:29,700
your page title or h1 somewhere towards

00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:34,200
the top of the page ideally in the first

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:37,260
paragraph of copy in alt text on images

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,960
on that page sprinkled throughout your

00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,820
copy and in some internal links

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,270
elsewhere on your site pointing back to

00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:48,300
that page after we've done this we're

00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:51,210
gonna go use the URL inspection tool to

00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,430
tell Google to re-index this page so

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,560
we're gonna put that in request indexing

00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,480
Google's gonna send his crawlers out and

00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:02,190
see those improvements we've made to

00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,480
this page and I did this a couple weeks

00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,490
ago just to see if we could get a little

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,609
bump and we see that our click-through

00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,589
rate improved 0.3 percent not terribly

00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:12,060
substantial I didn't really improve the

00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:15,300
content beyond just switching out the

00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,400
focus keyword so if I had we'd probably

00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,960
see more of a bump but the click-through

00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,940
rate improved just a little bit and our

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,190
position jumped up to six point seven

00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,900
from seven point four so it can have a

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,869
pretty immediate impact on how your

00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,240
content is able to rank however if your

00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:31,980
focus keyword is already performing

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,170
great then you don't want to switch it

00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:39,390
out you can keep letting it roll so in

00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,130
order to take action with this

00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,050
particular tactic you're gonna highlight

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,810
all those metrics add your pages of

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,520
filter click the queries dimension to

00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:50,310
see what keywords that page is ranking

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,290
for or appearing in search results for

00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,990
and which keywords are sending traffic

00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:57,810
to the site identify a good substitute

00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:00,569
keyword if your focus keyword isn't

00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:04,920
performing if it is you can just leave

00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:07,020
it integrate new keyword into your page

00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,400
all those places we just discussed and

00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:13,140
then request indexing and also this will

00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,500
be available this slide deck will be

00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,800
available at pathfinder SEO com /wc

00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:24,140
avielle so you will be able to get that

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:27,119
there if you need these down the road

00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,740
alright so we've improved our focused

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,130
keywords I want to talk about improving

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,319
the supporting keywords in our content

00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:36,060
so when it comes to supporting keywords

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,600
we refer to these in the SEO space and

00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,840
semantic

00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,030
related keywords and these are basically

00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,670
ideas that are related to our focused

00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,950
keywords so Yoast SEO site map has

00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:51,750
semantically related keywords yo sitemap

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:54,510
yes XML sitemap and so on Asheville has

00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:58,470
semantically related keywords like the

00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:00,540
Biltmore North Carolina breweries so

00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,960
these are basically just ideas that go

00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,450
together and so what we can do is use

00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,530
our queries report for a particular page

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,990
when we add that pages of filter and see

00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:17,130
what keywords is performing for we can

00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:20,960
see what other ideas Google likes this

00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:23,670
piece of content for and so we see that

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,880
Yoast XML sitemap is a semantically

00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,680
related keyword or a supporting keyword

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:32,100
that Google is also sending us traffic

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,100
for we're saying hey guys here's a great

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,720
article about yes XML sitemaps it's the

00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:40,980
same thing essentially is yes SEO

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,160
sitemaps but synonyms but what we can do

00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,170
is integrate these other keywords into

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,870
our content or make sure they're

00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:52,800
integrated in there and then expand upon

00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:55,380
the ideas that those keywords relate to

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,960
so we'd want to make sure this piece of

00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,170
content is actually talking about how to

00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:05,010
create a site map with Yoast in the

00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,780
article about Yoast SEO sitemaps because

00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,760
that's an idea people want to know about

00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,870
so we need to make sure we touch on it

00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,700
in our actual content go sitemap URL

00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,520
we'd want to tell people exactly what

00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:20,580
the yo sitemap URL is so that they can

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,340
go find it on their site so use these

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:26,370
medically related keywords to make sure

00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,230
your content is comprehensive and more

00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,930
definitive that's going to give it a

00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,700
much better chance of ranking in search

00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:35,070
results because Google's gonna see all

00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,050
of those keywords talked about in your

00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:40,110
article and say hey this is a great

00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,580
piece of content a couple other places

00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:44,070
you can finally semantically related

00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,440
keywords you can do an image search for

00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,840
us SEO sitemap for example you can see

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,880
some semantically related

00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:55,820
you could add and supporting keywords in

00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:58,730
your content or you can do a said Google

00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:01,490
Suggest search so you search for US SEO

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,810
sitemap and then click back into the

00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,490
search bar and it's going to show you

00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,440
all these other terms that people are

00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,730
searching for at the same time they're

00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,960
trying to learn about that particular

00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:12,440
idea and then you can select a few of

00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,480
those

00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,910
ideally starting with the ones that are

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,040
appearing in queries and then expand

00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:22,040
upon them integrate those keywords and

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,320
the ideas are about into your content to

00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:31,100
improve it and make it more attractive

00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:32,330
to both users and Google so when it

00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,850
comes to your semantically related

00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,470
keywords here's how you can take action

00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:39,350
so you can identify those supporting

00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:41,300
keywords in your queries report then go

00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,740
into your piece of content and see if

00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,960
they're already there maybe you already

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,120
talked about them in which case you're

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,790
set and if you didn't talk about them

00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,650
add that particular keyword that was

00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:55,420
showing up in queries into your content

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:59,510
and expand upon the idea that it's about

00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:01,340
that keywords related to and make sure

00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,080
you do this naturally you don't want to

00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,520
just throw them in there in a hacky kind

00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,040
of way because that's not gonna help

00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,870
anyone Google and us we're all trying to

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,210
make the internet a better place so when

00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:16,370
you naturally integrate these Google is

00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:17,780
more likely to reward you all right so

00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,610
we're closing in on it here and I want

00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,940
to talk about one more tactic and how

00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:26,090
you can use Google search console to act

00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,860
upon it so I want you to be able to

00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,390
build ranking power and spread it

00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,540
throughout your site using Google search

00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,090
console and you can do that in part by

00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,800
looking at the links report and start in

00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,210
the bottom left-hand corner so when you

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,940
go to the links report what Google is

00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,510
going to show you is the pages on your

00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:46,220
site those that have the most external

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,170
links pointing to them from other web

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,650
sites around the internet that's

00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:53,870
toppling pages toppling sites top

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:56,780
ranking sites are those sites that are

00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,990
sending the most links your way top

00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,230
linking text is

00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:04,230
anchor text of those links that are

00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:06,869
pointing at your site then the internal

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:09,450
links that's gonna show you the pages on

00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:11,250
your site and how many internal links

00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,410
each one of those pages has pointing at

00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,240
them ideally you want your most

00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:17,460
important pages to have the highest

00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,839
number of internal links your least

00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,099
important pages to have the lowest

00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:25,380
number of internal links but what you

00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,990
can do to improve your ranking power and

00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,780
then spread it is start by doing some

00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:34,320
link building so say you own the website

00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,670
I hate cilantro com when you record

00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,230
there's a lot of ways to do link

00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,240
building there's like thousands of

00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,680
tactics but we like to recommend you

00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,750
start by leveraging your business

00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,580
relationships and an easy way to do that

00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,740
is by creating a spreadsheet like this

00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,330
where you identify your partner's your

00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,790
affiliates organizations and

00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:53,180
certifications you have some your top

00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:56,130
customers nonprofits you help out

00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,550
prominent leaders on your team podcasts

00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:02,130
and news media and then where you have

00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:06,359
these relationships lift them out

00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:08,220
underneath here in each column and then

00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:11,190
you want to go to each one of those

00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:13,020
relationships and say hey we have a

00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,770
great partnership or we worked on this

00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,630
project together

00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,160
would you mind throwing a link our way

00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,460
here's a great place you could put it on

00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,109
your website when you leverage your

00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,580
business relationships to build those

00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,440
links that's one of the some of the

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:29,130
lowest hanging fruit in the link

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,170
building game so we'd go - cilantro

00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:33,390
sucks Oregon say hey guys we're in this

00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:35,250
together can you please send a link our

00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:40,619
way and we'll do the same send one back

00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:42,150
your way or we might go to say the

00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:44,970
kitchen comm because they wrote an

00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:47,880
article about our funny website because

00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:50,640
not all people love cilantro and say hey

00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,430
thanks for writing that that article can

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,320
you make sure you link back to us so

00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,740
leverage your business relationships to

00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,720
start with a link building strategy then

00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,109
once you have those internal links

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:08,200
pointing at your site see which pages

00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:09,280
have the most incoming links

00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,140
those are gonna be your most powerful

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,530
pages they have the most link equity

00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:16,810
coming from those other websites flowing

00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,630
through those links so link equity is

00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:24,520
ranking power link juice as we call it

00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:26,829
an SEO those pages with most external

00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,609
links pointing on them are going to have

00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:33,579
the best ability to perform in search

00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:35,740
they also have the ability to send some

00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:37,359
of that linking power that ranking power

00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:42,640
that they're getting from those other

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:44,740
sites to other pages on our site there

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,890
might be a little bit deeper and so what

00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:49,450
we can do when we know which which of

00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:53,650
our pages are performing the best is

00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:56,140
create or build internal links to pages

00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:59,680
that we're looking to boost a little bit

00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,839
and so if we identified some pages that

00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,859
we want to boost in search results we

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,890
want to give them a little bit more

00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:09,820
ranking power we could send some or

00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:13,359
build some internal links from our home

00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:16,000
page or that XML sitemap article

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,250
pointing at those pages that we're

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,599
looking to boost now you don't want to

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,460
build a ton of Link's because that's

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,300
going to dilute all your ranking power

00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,950
but maybe a half dozen and most it's

00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,040
kind of like if you had four links on a

00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,630
page all those pages internally that

00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,910
those links are pointing at are gonna be

00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:36,520
getting 25% of that ranking power it's

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:40,060
sent to them so if you have a ton of

00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,790
links you're gonna be really diluting

00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,130
that and not really achieving the the

00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:48,660
end result that you would want to by

00:54:45,130 --> 00:55:01,110
building those internal links yes sir

00:54:48,660 --> 00:55:05,520
if there's somebody if we should link to

00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:08,970
their page it really depends on what

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,990
that relationship looks like if we have

00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,990
a good partnership we're trying to

00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:15,450
bolster that partnership we will often

00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,730
very easily send a link their way

00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:20,670
because it's very helpful and maybe

00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,620
it'll send one back our way so it is a

00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,140
case-by-case basis it's kind of just

00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,170
hard to take a broad brush when

00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,280
approaching that but yeah um if you'd

00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,870
like to talk to me about that a little

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,850
bit more in depth we could jump into the

00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:42,560
happiness bar and take a look at some

00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:47,280
specific examples yes ma'am as many

00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:49,800
externally as possible internally keep

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,420
the number relatively low ideally if

00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,580
you're trying to boost other pages

00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,440
otherwise you're going to totally dilute

00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,110
your ability to send that ranking power

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,340
throughout your site so the fewer the

00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:03,840
better because that's really gonna push

00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:24,180
more of that ranking power through right

00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:38,040
they give you like right okay yes manual

00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:40,350
actions yes I don't know I never abuse

00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,510
Rich Snippets I hold the Rich Snippets

00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:45,150
in very high regard so I always try to

00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:46,890
treat them with as much respect as

00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,720
possible um I don't know exactly how

00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:52,170
folks are doing that maybe it's writing

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,510
some hacky json-ld that's they're trying

00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:56,610
to get them ranking better in Rich

00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:59,790
Snippets I don't know how to do that

00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:01,320
might be a blackhat SEO tactic I try to

00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:10,470
keep it on the white hat side of things

00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:12,800
so that could be so yes alright so take

00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,640
action when it comes to building links

00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,080
identify those link building

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,940
opportunities using a spreadsheet

00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,130
leverage your business relationship

00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,560
ships to start out that's the lowest

00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,810
hanging fruit build more of those links

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,720
identify the pages that have the most

00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:30,780
link equity ranking power flowing into

00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,940
them from externally on the web and then

00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,400
build internal links that are going to

00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:38,720
send some that ranking power to pages on

00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,370
your site that you want to boost and

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,240
that's going to set you up for success

00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:47,100
with some of that link building and so

00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,990
we're closing in on it here I want to

00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,570
leave you with this one in action breeds

00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:53,810
doubt and fear action breeds confidence

00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:56,970
and courage if you want to conquer fear

00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:58,590
let that wave of stress wash over you

00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:00,360
like we were talking about do not sit at

00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:02,280
home and think about it go out and get

00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,770
busy and that's why I gave you all these

00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,840
sections to take action these are things

00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:08,460
you can actually go home and do and the

00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,420
more of them you do the better off

00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,070
