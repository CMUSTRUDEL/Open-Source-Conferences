	There is a lot of talk today in the WordPress world about using a content-first approach to design. And, while that is one reason to use a content-first approach, it is not really the most compelling reason. In this session I will share how to implement a content-first website development approach that prevents project delays, increases project productivity, and thereby increases your overall project return on investment.

my name is Beth Livingston I currently

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,110
live in Greensboro North Carolina and

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,990
today we're going to talk about how to

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,890
hold on to more of your project profits

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,900
by using a Content first approach but as

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,490
always at wordcamp first I'm gonna tell

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,560
you a little bit about me

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,269
that's my headshot from when I did that

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,060
little stint in New York I don't look

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,300
like that anymore wish I did but this

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,360
was my my avatar everywhere online for a

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,969
while and then I felt like I was being

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,030
not genuine by having a picture from

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,879
2006 up there but I do have a master's

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,219
degree in education my website is WP red

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,440
maps and you can get me at that email

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:55,710
address I spent 25 years or more we

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,370
won't say how many as a business analyst

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,579
in IT consulting space I was mostly in

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:11,210
the financial industry let me get my

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:12,360
slides down here please sorry okay so in

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,880
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,409
back in 2009 you know that was during

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,150
the couponing craze everybody didn't

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,070
have any money because the market had

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,450
crashed and all that and but I hate

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,759
couponing so I was going to create this

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,439
web app where it well you could create a

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,670
profile of the stuff you always buy and

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,680
just tell you where it's on sale through

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,150
the lion Harris Teeter Publix wherever

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,070
great idea

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,460
by the time I actually got it launched

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,939
when I left corporate IT in 2016 nobody

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,119
gave a crap the economy had improved who

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,220
knew that and a growing economy could

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,689
make your product obsolete I just didn't

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,770
know where my audience was so I said you

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,149
know what I'm gonna do it instead

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,070
because I've now I've learned so much

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,869
about WordPress I'm gonna start building

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,460
roadmaps like a complete solution how to

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,960
do a membership site how to do an

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,189
e-commerce site front to back what are

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,869
the right plug-ins what are the right

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,100
this and that and then I met Adam

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,140
Preiser does anybody know who that is WP

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,479
crafter he has a great Facebook page a

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,099
great YouTube channel and he's already

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,650
doing that and he's doing a really good

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,069
job the men can create 20 video

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,860

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,959
does all kinds of evaluations and tests

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,090
of these plugins so I'm still in his

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,780
group and he's really good that I got to

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:29,120
meet him when I was in California but so

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,189
he made my business obsolete what I was

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,409
planning to do and then I started going

00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,569
to work camps and meetups and started

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,959
hearing all these complaints about

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:40,730
fighting scope creep and how do I

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
couldn't get content from the customer

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,950
and all these things that I know how to

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,889
do because I did it for 25 years in IT

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,819

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,520
five surprising secrets to increasing

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,780
WordPress project profits without

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,240
raising your price

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,670
and the subtitle is how simple process

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,010
changes can get 100% of you look I take

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,420
lessons from Amy Porterfield she's like

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,670
the digital course queen of the world

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,620
and she says not to worry about how long

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,220
the title is the important thing is to

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,750
get the point across so so a hundred

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,280
percent of your projects completed on

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,630
time and under budget and delight your

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,150
clients that's the first one

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,590
number two is why your wordpress design

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,450
and development skills are no longer

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,460
enough and what to do about it

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,990
eight client questions you need to be

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,390
prepared to answer to win the project

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,240
even if they don't ask and then your

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,400
last choice is neither either because

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,720
you never sign up for webinars you don't

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,490
like any of them with either one of

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,960
those topics or you have some other

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,530
reason and I would like for you to tell

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,660
me privately in the hall okay so how

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,020

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,380
category see any term the title is kind

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,850
of salesy you're kind of pitchy the

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:49,160
really geeky people don't like it are

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,210
you a developer are you a demean that

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,210

huh

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,030
it's going to kind of get into the

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:20,470
nitty-gritty it's probably more geared

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:22,090
towards agencies and stuff okay thank

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:38,710

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,270
well my target market is developers who

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,870
managed WordPress projects did you want

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,870
to say something

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:25,140
I have five surprising secrets and eight

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:27,990
questions oh you know I had it that way

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,820
and I put it out on a couple of

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,760
WordPress Facebook groups and they hated

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,840
it

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,840
it was probably a bunch of geeky people

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,240
I'm just kidding

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,850
okay let's go let's move on to the real

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:48,680
content huh oh okay

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,680
you think that'll grab people more yeah

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,660
well I'm doing a total of four so I was

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,340
trying to decide should I do one two of

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,320
them that's a great way to do your a be

00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,820
testing is do the first two using one

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,030
and the second two doing the other and

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,250
see how it turns out okay all right so

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:10,670
let's move on to the actual content okay

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,720
so what are you gonna learn today I

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,420
wanted to tell you that one of the

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,830
things that Amy says is you know you

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,170
really need to get in front of your

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,060
ideal customer avatar or ICA as she

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,070
calls it and that's one the one thing I

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,700
love about WordPress you are all my I

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:30,030
CAS so I love that I did wanna mention

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,650
that so you're gonna learn why should

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,229
you even think about content first

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,940
development see there's a lot of people

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:40,080
out there talking about content first

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,190
design and I'm gonna tell you the

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,220
difference between the two in a minute

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,050
but nobody's talking about I think it

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,910
goes further than that I think it is

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,180
needs to be content first all the way

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,190
through the development product project

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,620
process how content first development

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,440
differs from content first design the

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,320
six steps of content collection five

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,760
content first best practices and how all

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,790
of this helps you hold on to your

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,790
profits more so

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,240
so let's do a little audience

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,360
participation before we move on to the

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,040

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,490
for the client when it wasn't in the

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:57,610
original plan sit down yeah you are all

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:58,960
in the right place okay so a lot up to a

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,250
lot of you this little scenario I'm

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,430
getting ready to say will sound very

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,900
familiar you got a new client you've

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,920
done a great you know it was kind of

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,990
like what Emily was talking about

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,790
earlier this morning you've got a great

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,440
client a new client you've done a great

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,300
job defining the solution and

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,100
identifying the content the client needs

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,960
to provide you've worked with the client

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,330
to agree upon a schedule to which they

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,130
will provide the content you accept a 50

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,080
percent deposit you get to work on the

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,050
website you'll get the other 50 percent

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,420
of the end and the client first content

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,280
deadline comes and they don't deliver so

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,020
you gently remind them you come to them

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,000
and you plead with them you send them

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,230
you send them part of it they end up

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,810
sending you part of the agreed-upon

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,790
content and then it takes several weeks

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,440
to get the rest in the meantime you take

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,540
on another project to make up for the

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,520
delay in cash flow and just when that

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,170
project is in full swing the font client

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,510
first client finally delivers their

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,300
content and wants you to meet the

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,650
originally agreed upon date so chances

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,940
are if you have been doing this for any

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,380
period of time you've experienced

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,680
something similar to that scenario I'm

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,970
gonna tell you why that doesn't work

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,110
okay here's the traditional development

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,060
method the first thing that's wrong with

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,550
this graphic is that the phases are not

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,170
all the same size but you see where

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,430
content sticks right in the middle and

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,410
that's where your project is always

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,520
going to stall so we're going to talk

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,530
about a completely different way to

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,940
structure your payment schedule and just

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,550
give up that 50 percent

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,410
stuff it does not work okay so let me

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,690
ask you this question how long if you

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,160
had everything up on the shelf all your

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,170
plugins you already knew how you were

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,230
going to configure them you already knew

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,970
all of that and you had all your content

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,380
right there waiting for you how long

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,920
would it actually take you to build the

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,660
website right well depending on how many

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,040
pages if it's a five page brochure site

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,020
I can do that in an hour right okay so

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,990
this is this is the best of all possible

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,520
worlds and exactly where we want to be

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,980
so the difference is a content first

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,720
design is that you consider the totality

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,640
of the content before creating the

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,530
design doesn't mean that you have it all

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,860
in your hand as you're considering it

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:06,880
and I this was actually clarified by

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:09,010
Jennifer born in Orange County when she

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,830
gave a talk and said she was talking

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,510
about how people she doesn't believe in

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,190
content first development she said you

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,080
get all the content up front she says

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,290
this is what content design was supposed

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,540
to be okay but there's another piece

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,130
which is content first development and I

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,750
believe because the result of content

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,450
first design is that you get a design

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,980
that best accommodates the content

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,020
content first development is that you

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,810
don't build until you get all the

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,550
content and the result is you get the

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,980
same results as content first design

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,260
plus it puts the proper resources

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,630
control the project is less likely to

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,270
stall development time is reduced and

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,550
that helps you to hold on to more of

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,140
your ROI so I just showed you how

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,850
development time can go to practically

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,920
nothing if you've got everything all

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,180
lined up but there's a lot of there's a

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,100
lot of issues I mean a lot of best

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,150
practices a lot of processes that you're

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,300
probably going to need to change if you

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,860
want to employ this this procedure so

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,140
the stick six steps of content

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,390
collection are determining the initial

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,000
content requirements craft an initial

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,660
content estimate set client expectations

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,530
regarding content refined content needs

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,020
populate your content collection

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,390
mechanism and manage the content

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,010
collection activities and we're going to

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:27,820
go into each one of these a little more

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:29,890
deeply but before we do that you know I

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,560
hate to say this I'm in a lot of these

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,930
some WordPress Facebook groups

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,759
and they classified people into two

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,470
groups notice I'm not doing the

00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,870
classifying okay this is the way I hear

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,689
there are button pushers and then there

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,339
are consultants okay so which you're

00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,540
either just you're gonna build websites

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,550
and that's all you're going to do are

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,959
you going to manage the project and even

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,990
the ones that tout themselves as

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,999
consultants have the clients content

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,279
activity if the client insists on doing

00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:59,290
the content as one giant chunk and they

00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,920
don't do any estimating for it that's

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,839
silly

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,420
you're the project manager you have to

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,550
figure out how big is that task and make

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,529
the client aware of how big the task is

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,670
and a lot of times it'll make them

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:14,170
realize they don't they're not qualified

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:16,420
to do it I have a blog article on my

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,059
website how to convince your client they

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,579
are not the right resource for content

00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,740
okay so if you're going to determine

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,699
initial content requirements the first

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,759
thing you're going to do is start with a

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:33,279
visual sitemap then you are oh you're

00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,230
gonna then take that stuff that's on the

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,269
sitemap and see how many regular pages

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,370
you have how many Gallery pages how many

00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,290
product pages I break it down into those

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,509
three groups because anything that's not

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,500
a gallery or a product page is a regular

00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,910
page so why are you estimating content

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,759
it was just what I said a minute ago it

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,920
is your job to manage the project not

00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,079
just the part you're doing but the whole

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,660
project and your client will thank you

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,149
for this so it's our job to manage the

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,009
project you create a rough order of

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,509
magnitude of the clock of the content

00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:06,939
that's going to be required for this

00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,800
website and you show that to the client

00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,870
it can be a selling tool if you offer

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,540
copywriting services or you have a

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,480
partner that does the copywriting for

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,839
you you can send them some business this

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,660
way and it also is a good basis for your

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,399
initial project estimate all right I'm

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,860
gonna go off on a little soapbox here

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,839
for a second and Emily brought it up

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,540
this morning to stop calling it a quote

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,529
it is not a quote it is an estimate

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,050
because

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,120
estimates change quotes is like the guys

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,679
coming to build a fence in your yard he

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
can measure it he knows exactly what

00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,250
materials he's going to use and exactly

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,259
how much it's going to cost until you do

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,750
a deep dive until you get really into

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,970
the new

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,000
details of your customers business

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,490
requirements you can't give them an

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,020
accurate Oh almost set accurate estimate

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,660
which you can't say either because

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,340
there's no such thing estimate it

00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,810
implies that it will change and it will

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,210
probably change over the course of the

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,630
project that's a whole nother topic for

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,840
another day ok so to do this what I do

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,440
is I take each one of those pages

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,950
individually I list them on a

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,980
spreadsheet

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,600
I should spreadsheet and I estimate ok

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,640
how many paragraphs do I think are going

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,270
to be on that page how many images how

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,970
many videos products forms and tables

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,870
because all of those I saw all the forms

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,810
of content that I generally use ok so

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,940
there's an example of I have a tool it's

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,100
content estimator tool and it does the

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,950
calculation on the last tab for all of

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,860
this this is just an example of how I do

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,540
it I'm kind of old school to y'all I've

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,160
been around since you know Windows was a

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,610
toy and no self-respecting business

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:51,620
would use a Mac ok so this is the final

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,040
page of my rough order of magnitude

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,050
estimate where then I give ok if there

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,400
if I take 15 minutes to write a

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,950
paragraph and that's just an arbitrary

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,710
number I pull down this guy ok so

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,900
whatever you think is the estimate there

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,790
in five minutes per image eight hours

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,380
per video and so forth and then I came

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,900
up with a total number of man-hours

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,540
and when you show that to a client it's

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,949
impactful then they finally go you know

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,230
I don't think we can write all that

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,939
content by the due date you know all

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,709
right and then it convinces them to get

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,760
help

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:26,630
all right setting the client

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,670
expectations regarding content is first

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,160
you need a content management process

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,420
you need to write it down what is it and

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,530
you need to share it with your client

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,540
when you're going through the proposal

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,980
this is how we handle content now if

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,250
you're doing the content first thing

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,930
then you need to explain that to them

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,340
you want to explain common content

00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,720
issues this is another one of my big

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,220
things I get on my soapbox about you

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,410
have to be brutally honest with the

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,960
client about things that typically go

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,430
wrong in a project don't just not

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,110
mention them because you're gonna try to

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,750
not for it not to happen it's gonna

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,970
happen so tell them usually

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,010
ten stalls when the client doesn't meet

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,510
their delivery date and we're gonna put

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,030
some processes in place to make sure

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,140
that doesn't happen how can they not

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,030
like that your job is if they're not

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,380
necessarily the best resource for the

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,630
job that's part of your job is to

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,710
convince them they're not I don't care

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,630
how much money they think they're gonna

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,179
save it's not in their best interest in

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,919
the long run and then explain to them

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:24,440
what's going to happen if the content is

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,240
not delivered on time and then you show

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,309
them that rough order of magnitude so

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,919
that's how you set the kant's

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,909
expectations regarding content it's very

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,020
important another thing you can do is

00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:38,570
incentivize here's what I asked

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,010
sometimes do if during the first couple

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,929
of meetings I'm getting the feeling

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,220
because I hate trust your gut alright if

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,539
you're feeling like they're not probably

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,919
going to get it done on time they're

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,409
probably not like there they're

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,710
overworked or their staff is just too

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:55,010
busy I sometimes and I do not pad

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,710
estimates okay but I will add like five

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,480
hundred bucks to the estimate and say if

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,480
you get your content in on time I will

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,740
take five hundred off the total so I'm

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,059
not really out any money but they feel

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,090
like they got a bargain and it gives

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:10,460
them a an incentive to get that done or

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:16,610
$1,000 or $5,000 whatever you want to

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:19,909
use so when you step four now I'm trying

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,200
to go backwards hold on Oh step three we

00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,539
were still in step three which is set

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,850
the client expectations okay step four

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,140
refine the content needs this is when

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,720
you review the rough order of magnitude

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,130
with the client assign the activities

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,140
because you've had conversations about

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,059
who is going to do it it could be you

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,980
could be the client it could be a third

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,190
party so you got to assign those

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,710
activities create your content

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,980
specification you can use a variety of

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,929
things to do that will come so populate

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,370
the content collection mechanism all

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:52,130
right depending on the complexity of

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:57,200
your project and your client and their

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:58,850
ability to handle technology there are a

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
number of tools you can use

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:06,140
I used slick plan to create sitemaps but

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,450
I'm moving over to content snare for

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,450
getting the content from the client

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,929
and then sometimes if it's really small

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,929
I just use a spreadsheet and I'm an it

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:22,649
to the client or just paper I do have

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:24,179
some I'm working on some paper templates

00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:26,100
for content specification and then you

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,919
can just translate that into whatever

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,960
tool you decide to use you know every

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,519
online tool every theme every plug in

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,370
every hosting company it's all like

00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,750
religion everybody thinks their way is

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,260
the only way to heaven and everybody

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,179
else is misguided so don't listen all

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,980
that crap you hear online about this

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,409
hosting companies talks and all that

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,490
stuff I was so happy to hear Chris say

00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,590
that because I've been preaching that

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,370
forever because if you get better at

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,289
your job

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,330
chances are the bad hosting company that

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,799
was bad ten years ago it has a bad

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,230
reputation they're probably better at

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,350
their job now too so it's just my thing

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,330
all right step six manage the content

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,120
collection activities break the job down

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,760
for the client you know make it easy for

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,320
them give them little goals to reach and

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,549
then they feel like they've satisfied

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
themselves or if you're doing that in

00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,159
the Santa vidas thing you can give them

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,559
a little little piece of money every

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,220
time they meet a deadline and eke it out

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,380
that way

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,789
then it's your job to ensure that the

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,659
content is being delivered to the

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:27,210
repository whatever that is paper a tool

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:30,090
whatever ensure that content is being

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,679
delivered in the proper format have

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,730
regular status calls with the client

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,039
this is another thing I can't believe

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,559
people don't do I mean in corporate IT

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,539
every week come hell or high water you

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,399
had a staff you had a project status

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,960
meeting and everybody had to talk about

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,039
the action items from last week and what

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
you got done and what you didn't get

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,700
done and then not only helps the client

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,139
it helps your relationship with the

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,880
client but it helps you know where you

00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:58,289
are and then offer help to the client if

00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,419
they need it but always charge and if

00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:04,250
there are signs that the dates will be

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:06,840
missed invoke the change control process

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,970
immediately how many people have a

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,399
written change control process wait for

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:16,590
the rest of the question that you follow

00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:18,899
without exception exactly see this is

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,669
the problem you need to put a change

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:20,950
control process in place good news for

00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,460
you

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,380
got a free one for you on my website if

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,230
you go to WP road maps forward slash

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,840
templates I have a sample change control

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,040
process you can download you do have to

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,670
give me your email address

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,750
it's an opt-in sorry but for your email

00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,920
address you're gonna get some good

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,890
content here okay so let's talk about

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,840
content first best practices wait is my

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:54,780
time up I feel like I'm going along

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:54,780
already do I go all the way to 12 okay

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,250
content first best practices use a

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,480
two-step proposal process and I'll

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,760
explain that in a little more detail in

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,550
a minute restructure your payment

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,610
schedule embrace the idea of a Minimum

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,580
Viable website structure the project

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,620
plan for content first and automate

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,230
where possible that should be the last

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,930
step in everything you do

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,490
automate where possible all right so

00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,480
let's talk about this 2-step proposal

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,250
process I'm gonna tell you right now

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
it's not for everybody some people

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,150
complain about this it's oh that's

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,230
overkill for a wordpress project I can

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,940
get everything I need in that first

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,310
meeting with the client I say I called

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,080
the S but that's what they say just

00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,840
making that disclaimer this is not for

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,640
everybody alright so let me describe it

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,930
to you I should have put it on the slide

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,310
but okay when I do a proposal and Emily

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,550
talked about this about not being too

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:53,410
precise in your proposal I give a range

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:56,740
estimate of cost and at range cut and a

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:59,050
range of estimate for time and then I

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,540
make the first phase the deep dive

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,040
discovery and they give me a deposit if

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,110
they accept the proposal they give me a

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,210
deposit that covers all the way through

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,490
that process

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:12,820
so I give them the option to back out

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,590
after that and then I but only if the

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,990
new estimate that after I did the deep

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,390
dive and then if we found things that we

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,830
didn't know about they get documented

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,010
the client is right there with you the

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,170
whole way so they are fully aware of why

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,210
the second estimate is more but

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,330
generally it most of the time I know it

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,180
doesn't exceed so if it doesn't exceed

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,780
they don't get a chance to cancel but if

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,850
it goes

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,350
over the original estimate then I give

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,430
him the option to cancel they hardly

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,540
ever do though because they've been

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,980
there with you the whole time

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,080
but if they do I just hand them that

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,510
detailed statement of work they go

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,520
they've already paid for it they go off

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,220
and find somebody else to implement my

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,510
solution and that's the other thing that

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,030
happened is that sometimes when all we

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,220
do is drop off a proposal and say you

00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,770
know just call me or I'll call you in a

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:04,540
day or two never a good idea always a

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,920
walkthrough but so you'd hand up

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,320
statement of work and go on to a client

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,760
that suits you better so there's always

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,920
another client around the corner and we

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,660
tend to make allowances on our processes

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
and the things that we do because we

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,220
don't want to lose the client there's

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,590
another one down the street trust me so

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,720
when you use this two-step proposal

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,430
process you don't have to pad the

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,890
estimate because you're doing you're

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,770
just doing a global estimate to begin

00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,810
with then you're getting down into the

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,030
deep dive and documenting as you go

00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:40,090
things you find that are going to change

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:42,190
the the first estimate so by using this

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,860
process you get rid of the pad it

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,930
prevents doing a lot of work for $0 how

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,630
many people have spent hours hours hours

00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,790
and hours on a proposal I mean it is the

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,720
killer proposal of all time and you know

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:59,830
you've nailed it and you hear crickets

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,720
happens to everybody don't do that it's

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,290
okay if you know what the client needs

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,580
don't write it all down make it I forget

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,070
the words that Emily used this morning

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,830
but you need to be you know tell what

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,720
the what the what the stuff is without

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,670
saying all the nitty-gritty detail

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,690
because they don't care they just want

00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,520
to know that you're gonna get their

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,410
business needs met with their website

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,940
some of them we care about the design in

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:27,750
the color but they don't care about they

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,100
don't hear about your technical skills

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,470
ok restructure the payment schedule this

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,270
is how I do it okay so other people

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,530
might do it a little differently but

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,500
this is how I make sure I get paid for

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,480
that deep dive discovery upon acceptance

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,040
of the proposal they give me that

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,900
deposit that covers me all the way

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,760
through the statement of work upon

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,860
acceptance of the statement of work I

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,520
take I get

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:55,480
50% of whatever's left then we go to

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,210
client we go to content activities at

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,150
the completion of testing now see my

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,860
faces are a little different so this is

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,570
kind of a generic thing I'll show I

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,130
don't think I have that the faces that I

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,410
use in here but basically I have

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,350
development testing in the same phase so

00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,200
at the end of development and testing

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,480
you get I use 50% then I get 50% of

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,309
whatever's left and then the completion

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,230
of training that's when the rest of the

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:23,710
funds are due notice I didn't say at

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,000
launch because there's people and you

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,220
may have met some of you who may have

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,620
had this happen where you've built it on

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,780
the clients environment bad idea you

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,240
built it on the clients environment you

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,669
get all the way down to acceptance and

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,960
you never get paid for that last leg and

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,630
this is another reason I do it this way

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,950
because if that were to happen it

00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,320
doesn't happen because I don't I don't

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,520
make it live on their site until after

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,770
I've gotten theirs all remaining funds

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,350
but if it does happen it's only a little

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,330
fraction of the money because I've been

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,309
getting these incremental payments for

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,929
different milestones in the project plan

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:59,770
does that make sense

00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:02,140
all right embrace the Minimum Viable

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,790
website okay so you got a client maybe

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,400
they're moving a site so they've got

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,679
some content right but they want to do

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,400
all this stuff and you already know that

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,169
I'm not gonna happen by that video then

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,660
start with what they have and go ahead

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,400
and try to convince them to launch with

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,870
a minimum but what is the very minimum

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,070
that you need to have out there to meet

00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,590
your business requirements

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,570
do that and then we'll do the rest in a

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,400
phase two after we do the deep dive

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,210
discovery and collect all the content

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,860
that makes sense okay structure the

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,440
project plan for oh yeah here my phase

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,559
is now this will make more sense so I

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,000
call phase zero a zero because I don't

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,280
consider it a project until the

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,070
proposals been accepted so my first

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,840
phase in my process is proposal creation

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,630
and that's where I estimate the needed

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,429
content then project definition is where

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,740
identify who's going to do it and when

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,059
and I estimate again it's another thing

00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,490
we think we can do this estimate at the

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,160
beginning of the project never asked

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,470
that's cray-cray so you got to estimate

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,330
all along the project and of course if

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,340
this is a five page brochure site that

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,800
you finish in a week this is a little

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,640
bit of overkill okay but the principles

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,380
still apply so you can scale it down

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,390
then I do design in preparation this is

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,240
when we click the client a third party

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,180
or me collects all the content as well

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,160
as getting the environment set up and

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,080
you know but and I may do a mock-up but

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,660
I know development work has taken place

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,760
yet at all first three phases in our

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,440
development work then development

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,420
testing and then deployment and training

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,630
which is weird because development

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,160
becomes almost the anti climax of the

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,140
whole thing because if you've got that

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,230
plan and everything up on the shelf

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,500
ready to go development cz testing is

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,230
easier deployment training of both

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,460
easier and then automate where possible

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,350
and I showed you some of these things

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:58,170
before one new thing on the market that

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,820
just came out is WP feedback it's a new

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,560
plug-in most of those others are

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,210
external to WordPress they're just

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:08,130
they've just for anybody any kind of

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:09,930
project WP feedback is a way to get I've

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,420
not actually had time to look at it I

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:15,570
wanted to but I have it excuse me but I

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:18,240
do know that the premise is that you

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,710
have built either mock pages or actually

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,080
on the on the site that you're building

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,480
and your client can come in and leave

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,640
comments on specific areas of the

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,710
website like change this color of this

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,380
button to a different color or whatever

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,850
their comments are so how many learn

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,290
something so far that they want to

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,270
incorporate into their business please

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,580
raise your hand

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:42,480
really just five of you kidding there's

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:45,600
more people back there great okay so

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,240
let's do a little recap the six steps of

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,790
content collection determine your

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,920
requirements graphic content estimate

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,860
set your client expectations regarding

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,730
content refine the content needs

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,400
populate your content collection

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:04,170
mechanism manage the content collection

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,820
activities and our our best practices

00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,740
when you're implementing are using a

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,559
two-step approval process or

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,160
way that you get paid for that deep dive

00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,900
restructure your payment schedule

00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,809
embrace the idea of the Minimum Viable

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,210
website structure the project plan for

00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:22,470
content first and automate where

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:25,220
possible now if you want to learn more I

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,920
have some freebies on my website one is

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:31,830
how to use a project notebook for making

00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,510
yourself better at what you do and I'm

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,100
gonna change that cover I just really

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,470
fell in love with the scope creep wat

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,170
phu oh you guys are familiar with wap is

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,179
right i love him he's a villain they

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,510
call him a villain but I don't like the

00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,309
cover

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,170
anyway six easy ways to control scope

00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,510
creep in your project proposal and that

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,309
one actually has some language in it

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,610
that you can maybe scarf out and use in

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:57,330
your own projects and then I also the

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,340
the last one I base all of what what I'm

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,630
teaching and what I do on the six

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,440
principles of productivity management

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,620
for software development that John Keane

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,360
developed back in the 80s and I've taken

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,520
those six principles and modified and

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,260
remained specific for WordPress and so

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,490
that is it like a little short mini

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,350
course so that you can sign up for and

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,510
go through the modules and it talks

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,640
about all those principles and it's you

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,160
know it's it's Chris talked about one

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,440
this morning it's common sense stuff

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,150
that we forget like defining the job in

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,410
detail before you start getting to work

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,610
you know that was actually one of the

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,530
things Chris mentioned does one of the

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,750
mistakes he made when the client

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,170
accepted too quickly because he didn't

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,929
really do enough discovery

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:45,120
oh and again if you want that sample

00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,190
change control procedure go to WP read

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,220
maps comm forward slash templates or

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:54,960
there's also a templates menu item on

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,120
the main page or these two Facebook

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,220
groups one of them is uh WordPress

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,760
project management I administer that one

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,760
hold on please

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:07,020
the other one is the admin bar there's

00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,360
two guys that run it they have a podcast

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,250
and this Facebook group and they focus

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,190
more on the business side streamlining

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,140
the business side of what you do they

00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,669
evaluate different tools they put

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,920
different processes in place and they're

00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:23,730
very open about it and they're just

00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,410
really fun to hang out I love them so

00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:30,810
that's another one you might want to

00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:32,700
check out my name is Beth Livingston and

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,620
that's my presentation and I would

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,480
certainly love it if you liked what you

00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,360
heard here today if you could give me

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,690
some social media love appreciate that

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,580
and then oh if you just want to be kept

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,230
abreast of this product I have coming

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,000
out and you don't want any of those

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,920
freebies and you just you know you can

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
just text read maps two four four four

really wanted to go to it you still have

00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:41,429
an opportunity to watch it I love that

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,490
because I really wanted to go to Europe

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,260
and I don't get to go so I'm anxious to

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,320
watch the tops from Europe that'll be

00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:53,060
interesting really no questions about

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,060
content first is anybody going to try it

00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,750
yeah just go to my blog

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,900
showing him that wrong I mean that's

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:11,420
that's the biggest one right there you

00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,920
know and just I can't even remember what

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,490
all I put in there but it's like a

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,160
checklist I'm sorry I really drank too

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,980
much last night I can't remember what is

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,390
in my blog article I just wrote it last

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,130
week it was like one of those things

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,660
where you just said oh I need to shoot

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,800
this off and you write it real fast and

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,690
it comes out really good so you go ahead

00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,250
and post it but I didn't really think

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,119
too much about it because it's kind of

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:38,030
you know common sense to me so is

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,760
anybody gonna try this any of this yes

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:43,300
you are okay good which piece of it do

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,300
you like the best

00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:09,330
yeah yeah exactly

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,460
I mean that's another thing that people

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,410
tend to struggle with is and complaining

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,170
about my client just doesn't understand

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,280
how much in effort its put into all this

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,720
and they don't understand how our

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,150
project runes and they don't understand

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,330
this if you are saying my client doesn't

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,790
understand that's your fault you need to

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,080
explain it to them they don't work and

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,000
they don't have their head and all this

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,200
Kiki stuff all the time like we do I'm

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,730
shocked how much they don't know if you

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,000
whatever you think your client knows

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,590
subtract 70% and then teach it to him

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,320
that way I mean that's why those dummies

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,120
books came out y'all because you know my

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,380
dad told me before those books came out

00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,600
he said you need to write a book like

00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,670
that shows how dummies how to use

00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,960
computers and then those books came out

00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:59,550
it was a very interesting well okay so I

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,980
finished up a little early oh the

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:06,930
Facebook groups yeah sure anybody else

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,070
question I must just be a kick-ass

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,950
teacher that's all

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:15,660
oh are you gonna have to edit that out

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:17,490
of the video was that a bad word I said

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,100
one in Atlanta no where was it

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,270
Miami know who was here last year I said

00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,790
a bad word in my speech and I

00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,290
immediately went to the to the cameraman

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,280
and said oh my god oh my god can you

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:33,870
edit that out

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:36,060
and he said it's already gone yes so yes

00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:40,350
I but I'm not really a cursor but

00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,980
sometimes you just need a curse word yes

00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,420
exactly

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,420
Oh a question I'm so happy

00:37:56,939 --> 00:38:05,799
motivate clients to deliver content okay

00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:08,109
it it's hard to break it down into only

00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:10,180
content right because the setting the

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:13,329
client expectations you need to include

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,949
your processes in your proposal and you

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:16,930
need to go over each one of those

00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:18,819
proposal each one of those processes

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,559
with the client you're doing two things

00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,079
here remember you're shopping for a

00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,689
client - they're not just shopping for a

00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,099
provider you get to pick so if you're

00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:28,930
walking through this proposal and

00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:32,289
they're saying well that seems like a

00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:34,390
lot of work well that I don't like you

00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:36,099
you mean I got Sal use a change budget

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,579
okay this isn't part of this topic but

00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:41,709
I'm gonna tell you real quick if you did

00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,569
a true estimate using real hours and

00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:46,599
real stuff and didn't just pull a number

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:48,609
out of the air and then you take a

00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,749
percentage of that I usually use twenty

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:52,059
to thirty percent depending on the

00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:54,759
client and add that to the project it's

00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:58,180
not a pad it's set aside in a change

00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:59,650
budget they're in control of that change

00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,559
budget and when you implement your

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,119
change control process they get to

00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,989
decide are we going to use that money

00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:10,199
out of that bucket or not it seriously

00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:13,029
reduces the frivolous request for change

00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,239
gets them motivated to get their stuff

00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:18,219
done on time because that change budget

00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,609
it means if I lose time we're losing

00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:23,259
money - right so that's one way I do it

00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,779
is with the change control procedure and

00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:27,809
if they balk at that if they balk at the

00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:30,609
change budget bye-bye

00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,969
where they say now by Sheila what does I

00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:38,410
don't get what that means but anyway

00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:40,979
that does that help it all okay anybody

00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:44,140
else all right let's go have lunch oh

00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:46,839
and let me just say I am oh I wanted to

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,819
tell y'all didn't tell you that that

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,329
last year word camp asheville changed my

00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:54,160
life yeah okay so I gave that talk and

00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,689
because it was so well received is when

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,759
I said this is when I need this what I

00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:59,979
need to do I need to create something

00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:01,479
for these people that helps them with

00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:02,799
that and that all happened here at

00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,309
wordcamp and if I hadn't been at

00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,239
WordCamp

00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:05,650
I would have been floundering around

00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,200
forever trying to figure out what it is

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,700
I needed

00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,040
due to pull all of my talents together

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,570
so and you know what don't you feel like

00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,300
it's kind of like summer camp for geeks

00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,220
I love it I love being with all you

00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,260
people so go out have lunch meet

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,650
