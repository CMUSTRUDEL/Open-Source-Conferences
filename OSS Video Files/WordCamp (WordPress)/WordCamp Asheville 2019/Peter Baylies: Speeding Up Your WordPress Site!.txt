Title: Peter Baylies: Speeding Up Your WordPress Site!
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	This session covers how to analyze and identify slowdowns and bottlenecks in your website performance, use the right tools and plugins to optimize your website page speed, and leverage Javascript and the WordPress REST API to add fast, dynamic content on your newly speedy site!
Takeaways:
Performance analysis and debugging is the first key step in site optimization. This will guide the next optimization steps, such as caching, or image optimization. Often, there is much room for improvement, and complex sites can benefit from caching at several different levels.

all right hello everybody thank you

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,190
I haven't even done anything yet that's

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,400
great I'm just I'm just gonna bask in

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,160
the glow right now hi I'm Peter Bayliss

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,550
I work at a little startup in Durham

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,850
called picado my twitter handle is up

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,420
there at P Bayliss if you want to find

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:34,410
me follow me bug me I am available for

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,070
that picado is a little startup that is

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,620
about finding discounts on shoes so we

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,690
will not be talking about shoes today

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,970
but but that's that's their business

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,850
we're going to talk about speeding up

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,589
your WordPress site which I imagine even

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,269
if your WordPress site is is pretty

00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,190
speedy you still might want to do or

00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,540
might want to know about and if it's not

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:05,369
you probably really want to know about

00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:07,290
it so here we go all right so so when I

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,229
say like your website is slow you might

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,350
be thinking like it's not that slow like

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,180
maybe maybe you think it's fine but it

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,310
turns out that people are very impatient

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,560
and and they always want your site to be

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,090
a little bit faster because they just

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,960
they just want to move on they want to

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,840
get to the next page about three seconds

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,460
is is sort of the the baseline at that

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,770
point like people are already leaving

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,260
your site some of them may have left

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,180
already and so like if they're sitting

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,160
there and nothing is loaded like that is

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,050
just that's dead air that's bad that's

00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,340
like me just sitting here not saying

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,890
anything and so you'll also find out for

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,450
SEO Google will penalize slow websites

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,490
when they crawl your site they will

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,050
record that and they will say oh well

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,640
this sites faster than that site so

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,229
people are going to like that experience

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,659
better and so we're going to rank that

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,800
site higher than your site so there are

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,260
a lot of reasons to be concerned about

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,740
this both for the user experience and

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,020
for your search engine rankings and so

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,349
I'm going to go through a lot of things

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,510
just sort of a survey some of it is

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,989
technical I will probably lose you at

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,430
some point please raise your hand ask me

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,770
questions if you're confused

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,140
if we can't reconcile that in a

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,330
reasonable amount of time

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,140
then you can talk to me afterwards I

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,050
will wander over to the happiness bar

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,820
probably after lunch and and you know

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,280
certainly just talk to people after the

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,500
talk but we can just have a back and

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,330
forth and talk about website speed and

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,190
things you could be doing and so the

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,650
first thing the first technical term I'm

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,709
going to throw at you is this TTFN be

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,510
the the time to first byte and so that

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,920
is the amount of time it takes for

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,990
someone to get anything from your

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,700
website and so that's where you have

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,410
that blank screen when you first go to

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,150
that page the amount of time that you

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,750
wait there that's the time to first byte

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,630
it could be in milliseconds it should be

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,790
if it's in seconds that is bad you don't

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,910
want to be waiting a second staring at a

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,640
blank screen before you see anything and

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,410
then that could have to do with your

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,500
hosting with your web hosting with your

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,570
server performance it could just take

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,459
that much time to contact something or

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,780
start pulling that page it could be that

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,150
some things just really slow on that

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,820
server and what we want to do is kind of

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,299
drill down and find out why and identify

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,510
what the problem is and fix it you could

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,850
have a slow theme you could have a slow

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,250
plug-in use something within your

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,220
WordPress site this slow runs on top of

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,720
the server it could be individual

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,760
resources you could have a very large

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,350
image it takes a long time to load

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,160
that's slowing things down you could

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,430
have CSS files and JavaScript files that

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,900
are taking a long time or maybe you

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,310
don't know maybe it's gremlins maybe

00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,769
there's just something else going on

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,430
that you can't explain

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,430
we've seen that too

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,849
all right so I've got a nifty graphic on

00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,409
the side there and the things I'm going

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,729
over are going to relate to that you

00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:20,359
don't have to read it I think it's

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:22,699
pretty illegible but I generated that by

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,789
going to the word camp Asheville site

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,680
actually and so each one of those bars

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:30,770
has to do with how long it took

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,570
something to load on that page and if

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,120
you follow those links up top if you go

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,770
to ping Daum or webpage speed test you

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,780
can get a graph that looks like that and

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,259
you can put in the address of your site

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,370
and you can find out all those things

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,500
that you're loading from your site and

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,050
how long each of them takes and so that

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,599
is a waterfall view because it just sort

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,440
of cascades down like a waterfall I

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,360
guess that's what we call it you can

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,789
also do the same thing within Chrome or

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,289
probably within your web browser there's

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,990
usually a set of development tools you

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,820
can get to somehow in Chrome you can

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,250
right-click on the page and it says

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,630
inspect element and if you go in there

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,009
it'll bring up the dev tools and there

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,870
will be a lot of tabs and it will be

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,780
confusing but it has many interesting

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,270
nuggets buried in there and it will do

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,250
the same waterfall view and it'll have a

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,630
lot of information and instead of being

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,159
a static image it'll actually be a

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,389
dynamic thing that you can click through

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:26,060
and play with and find out more

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,259
information about all the resources so

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,300
if you're really interested in why

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:33,800
something is slow that's a great tool to

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,000
play with and so each one of these all

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,949
the waterfall views you'll encounter

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,759
pretty much tell you the number of

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,110
things you load the size of each thing

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,620
what type of thing it is if it's an

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,830
image if it's a script file and so you

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,750
know if you see a really long bar like

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,009
like whatever these four or five things

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,690
are down here

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,780
they're obviously taking the most time

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,229
because this is like a timeline and so

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,060
those are actually images I think those

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:04,219
are like sponsored images I think

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,840
there's probably like like PNG files

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:07,430
that someone just upload over there like

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,680
do you under kilobytes I bet that's fine

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,240
so this is actually a pretty fast site

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,639
there's no scale on here you don't know

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,199
how many seconds that is and at the

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,270
beginning you see that short bar at the

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,370
top that's the actual page and you see

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,300
it starts to load immediately and so

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,590
that's good you have a good response and

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,360
by the time of those down there or

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,150
loading you probably can't even see them

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,650
because they're further down on the page

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,080
so this is actually not a bad waterfall

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,330
chart what would be bad is if you had

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,620
the long bar at the top and you're

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,819
taking a long time just to get to the

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,740
page and and so that's that's sort of

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,740
the basics of of waterfall charts

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,030
I'd like to talk a little bit more about

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,310
the chrome dev tools themselves they're

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,770
excellent tools if you use Chrome just

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,770
please use them if you have an issue to

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,200
troubleshoot I'm gonna talk about two

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,850
panes in particular for this the

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,460
networking pane is the one I told you

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,440
about that has the waterfall views it

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,360
tells you every resources that load if

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,820
you click on any of them it will tell

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,280
you detailed what's the size when it

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,040
started to load all the details about it

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,630
and you can inspect and debug and drill

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,760
down into anything you can see exactly

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,240
what loaded if you click on an image it

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,210
will show you a picture of how it loaded

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,729
you can get into like just detailed like

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,360
script responses and so that's the the

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:37,190
pretty JSON views JSON is the JavaScript

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,610
object notation so if you have a

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,940
variable in JavaScript it's in JSON and

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,220
so you can open that up and see all the

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,350
different things you if I lost at this

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,050
point

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:55,850
just completely confused now I'm not

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,940
doing my job okay next we have the

00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,700
audits pane and this is great because

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,260
this is actually a human readable report

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,640
you know before I'm telling you to do

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,380
all the work go through the waterfall

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,270
view figure it out that's what I like to

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,680
do but some people just want a summary

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,320
they just want you to tell oh your

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,210
images are slow the audits pane actually

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,590
like they added this more recently and

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,770
it gives you a lot of great information

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,380
so you can run an audit on a page and it

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,570
will give you a report and tell you and

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,580
it will simulate a slow connection by

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,530
default and why you want to do this is

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,060
because like let's say somebody's on a

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,620
mobile phone and they only have two G

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,030
and they're trying to load your webpage

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,440
you might not have designed it for that

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,110
you might not have thought about that

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,430
use case but it happens and so then you

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,560
want it to load really fast

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,539
and you might be on your desktop at home

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,750
with a nice internet connection thinking

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,370
my pages are really snappy but when

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,070
you're on that phone they're not and you

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,839
aren't looking at it and this will try

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,970
it like that first and then you'll say

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,830
oh my websites really slow don't freak

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,020
out it's not that slow not most of the

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,190
time but it could be faster and it would

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,590
help those people if it was

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,760
and it will it will build that whole

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:08,010
report it has just so much information

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,590
and there's also a Chrome extension

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,450
there's a a lighthouse Chrome extension

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,590
the tool is called lighthouse it's from

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,320
a third party and I believe Google

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,760
licensed it but it still shows up in the

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,770
audits tab in chrome by default and

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,810
there's also an extension that you can

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,970
use just like so you don't have to open

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,650
the inspector and get in there you can

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,550
just click that button and get a report

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,740
for the page you're currently on so

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,090
that's pretty much everything about

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,090
troubleshooting any questions about that

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:48,450
cool so let's talk about images a lot of

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,800
times people just have really big images

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,950
and they might not even know that

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,500
they're big images your phone is amazing

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,950
it takes huge pictures they don't need

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,320
to be that big on your website cameras

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,660
these days are amazing DSLR cameras are

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,910
incredible they take enormous pictures

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,520
and so you're going to upload that into

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,530
WordPress and by default WordPress will

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,120
have that full sized image it doesn't

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,530
always load that full sized image but it

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,750
might depending on where you are on the

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:19,020
site WordPress tries to resize your

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,970
images down but you know it doesn't

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,620
always fix it for you not by default not

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,510
out of the box and so if you have a

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,720
photo just like a straight up you took a

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,600
picture of a person or something or a

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,510
scene a beautiful landscape you want to

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,160
use JPEGs for that and probably you

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,900
already do when you take that photo on

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,340
your camera but maybe you've got a stock

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,960
photo maybe you got a photo from

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,690
somewhere else maybe you got a really

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,780
high quality bit of artwork that's used

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,400
for a designer and it's in a PNG even

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,350
though it's a picture of a person or a

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,020
landscape you don't want to upload that

00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:01,380
directly into your website as a PNG you

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:03,310
want it as a JPEG yeah you do you don't

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,259
want to do that

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,499
you can actually download that picture

00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:10,689
and you can upload it again and so

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:14,649
here's the thing there's a plugin called

00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:17,860
insanity and I recommend this it's great

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,930
for a number of reasons it has you can

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,430
put in a maximum dimension for your

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,740
image uploads you can say I don't want

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,990
anything that's wider than two thousand

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,279
pixels or 1000 pixels if you know you're

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,879
never going to need that on your site

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,129
you can set a compression level so by

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,899
default WordPress defaults to 82 for a

00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,279
JPEG compression level you don't want it

00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,839
to be a hundred it doesn't need to be

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,939
that high quality and some of these

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,040
stock photos even if they're JPEGs might

00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,930
be like a hundred there's also an option

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,470
in insanity that you can check say

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,850
convert pngs to JPEGs for me and so if

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,129
you know you're never going to want a

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,509
raw PNG on your website you can do that

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,360
and then when you upload it it will

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:57,339
automatically get converted to a JPEG

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,990
and that's really nice and so that's the

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,759
situation if you had that plug-in and

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,920
you went in the settings for it and you

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,240
checked that box then the next time you

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,180
uploaded that image you could just

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,519
download it delete it upload it again

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,889
set it as an image in your post or

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,240
wherever you're using it and then it

00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,389
would be converted to a JPEG for you

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,819
okay

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,500
well that's nice that that probably does

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,730
a pretty good job on images but I don't

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,839
know that it would automatically convert

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,800
it for you but we can take a look at

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,680
that later there are also other tools

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,300
you can use to optimize your images if

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,519
you're on a Mac there's a great tool

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,649
called imageoptim that will try to

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,779
recompress your images it will do a good

00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,300
job of just crunching them down without

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,100
losing any detail there is an option in

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,569
there for if you want to actually reduce

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,639
the quality as well and still have it

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,559
look okay but that's not turned on by

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,389
default if you just get image often out

00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,040
of the box it doesn't change the quality

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:54,250
of your images but it tries to make them

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,379
smaller in file size there's another

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,019
tool called image alpha that is just for

00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,839
PNG s it's for reducing the number of

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,279
colors and still having it look good so

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,170
if you need to have a PNG because you

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,730
need a transparent image then you can

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,879
use image alpha to try to reduce the

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,649
size if it's really big and then there

00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,929
are similar tools on Windows I'd say

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,750
equivalents to those to our file

00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,050
compressor and color quantizer

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,970
respectively

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,670
file compressor is like imageoptim on

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,010
Windows it can crunch down images color

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,709
quantizer is like image alpha can reduce

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,830
down PNG s if you're on Linux you can

00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,810
probably figure this out for yourself

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:36,130
but but that's you know just handy GUI

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,290
tools for Mac and Windows and then if

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,360
you have logos or align our SDGs are

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,610
good for that so you wouldn't convert

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,079
something to an SVG probably but if you

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,120
were using illustrator or something you

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,529
might have something as an SVG and you

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,269
can use those on the web now and they'll

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,490
display it like pretty much fine and

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,170
they're usually pretty small although

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,990
you know again it's always worth looking

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:02,560
at the file size to verify that scalable

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,450
vector graphic is what SVG stands for so

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,320
it's fine art and then the lines are

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:17,230
just like clean strokes right right

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:19,480
there you go all right so maybe your

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,279
problem isn't that your images are just

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,740
too big maybe your problem is that you

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,329
just have too many little images maybe

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,130
you've got a gallery on your page maybe

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:29,620
you've got a wedding website and you've

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,930
got like a hundred images or 500 images

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,500
is some crazy amount of images that you

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,149
had you took and so there are lazy

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,930
loading plugins there's a plug-in called

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,399
lazy loader

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,649
there were actually a lot of these if

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,579
you look for this feel free to try them

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,410
and see what works for you

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:47,110
I like lazy loader there are different

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,890
ones and what it will do is it will only

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,709
load the image if it's on the screen and

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,570
so when you scroll down it'll be pulling

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,430
in more images and usually they'll be

00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,899
pulling in before you even see them

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,459
because usually these things happen

00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,050
pretty quickly but it doesn't happen

00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:04,000
quickly if it's trying to pull in 500

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,589
images at once it happens if it's just

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,690
pulling and a feeling is images at once

00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,520
it can just devote all those resources

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,130
to those few images and load them faster

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,959
also this helps the page load quicker

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,459
when you just first load the page

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,140
because it doesn't have to load

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,620
everything because you aren't looking at

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,329
it yet

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,550
by default browsers don't know what

00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,170
you're looking at that they're they're

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,760
trying to fix that Google is working on

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,589
that they're trying to get lazy loading

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,880
just built in the chrome but at the

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,380
moment you know you still want to

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,220
plug-in like this because not all

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,220
browsers would do that

00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,970
also there are sort of more technical

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,040
ways to combine images together there

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,230
are tools for building image sprites

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,730
which is literally like a big image that

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,249
has a bunch of little images in it and

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,410
you just show little parts of that a lot

00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:49,449
of websites use that for things that

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,249
show up on a lot of pages and so like

00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,989
again with Google if they have like they

00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,610
always have the logo and then they have

00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,989
a couple arrows and then maybe you have

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,970
some dots that they display for

00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,949
pagination just different design

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,569
elements so a lot of times the design

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:03,279
shop will combine that together into an

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:05,379
image sprite so it only has to load a

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,569
single image and then they can use CSS

00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:11,410
to just selectively show parts of that

00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:13,629
image and so that's a neat trick there

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,629
are also data your eyes you can actually

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,459
put an image into your CSS into your

00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,649
stylesheet by encoding it into a data

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,029
URI you don't really want to do that for

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,220
a big image because it takes up space

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:27,129
and your CSS is loaded across all your

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,239
pages usually but you might want to do

00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,279
it if there's an image that just you

00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:32,199
know shows up on all the pages because

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,089
then when your CSS file loads those

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,639
images also load along with it and

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,369
they're just referenced in the CSS so

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,049
that's another neat trick now I should

00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:45,489
say the only reason you do this at all

00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:49,029
is because HTTP the transfer protocol on

00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:50,559
the web used to be very slow for having

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,350
a bunch of resources that it has to

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,360
fetch because it would get each one and

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,939
have to talk back to the server and so

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,519
there's a newer protocol called HTTP 2

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:02,379
and if your web server supports that and

00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,879
if you're in the chrome inspector it

00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,500
will tell you it will tell you what the

00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,829
protocol is for all the connections so

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,130
it will say HTTP slash 1 HTTP slash 2

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,929
different things if you see that / -

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,880
then you'll know that it's actually

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,529
going to be faster for having a bunch of

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,389
small resources because it keeps that

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:21,699
connection open so it doesn't have to

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:24,220
keep talking back it just says give me

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,919
these images and it just streams them

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,909
all through that open connection and so

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,740
then you don't have to worry as much

00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:32,019
about having a lot of small images they

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,090
still load pretty fast or a lot of small

00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:36,880
CSS files or a lot of small JavaScript

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,950
files so if you know your server is HTTP

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,740
- then the number of resources isn't as

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,210
important it can still be important

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,260
because javascript files can load other

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,000
JavaScript file

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,679
so you could be waiting for something to

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,330
load that and if it was meant off' I'd

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,640
it would just pull in one javascript

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,960
file but in general that speeds things

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,309
up for small resources but you would

00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,840
need to make sure that's configured on

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,280
your web server or have somebody do that

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,900
for you if you don't know how to do that

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,000
that would actually be like a

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,799
configuration file in a setting on a

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
server that someone would have to change

00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,790
and restart and it might not always work

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,110
you probably want to test it out

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,299
somewhere else first before you go

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,260
taking down your server if you're using

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:19,809
that for anything if you do just have

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,250
too much CSS or JavaScript and you want

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,200
to compress it or minify it together

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,960
there are a couple of good plugins for

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,570
that one of them is called Auto

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,190
optimizer or ought optimizer somehow

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,020
they just thought to just stick that 100

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,960
in there and I don't know if it's

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:38,200
British or how you say that and then

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,010
there's also be WP minify so between the

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,950
two of those

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,540
I'd say Auto optimizer probably has less

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,179
settings but they have like a button to

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,750
see more settings they're both pretty

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,190
robust a danger with minification is

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,350
it's always possible that something

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,059
could minify incorrectly and you

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,980
wouldn't see it right on your site so it

00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,679
could break your layout or it could just

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,799
cause a script to give an error these

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,720
two plugins are usually pretty good but

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,010
they also have some options for if you

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,690
know there's a script that causes

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,580
problems to say don't minify this one

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,110
script identify everything else together

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,790
and then this one that's a problem just

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,990
keep that one out and usually it takes

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,490
some trial and error to figure that out

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,470
if you have that problem where you need

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,910
to troubleshoot like which script you

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,410
have to sort of play whack-a-mole and

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,750
say okay is that this one is that that

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,690
one maybe just disable half of them and

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,100
narrow it down you know hopefully you

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,090
won't run into that but that can be a

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,090
problem with meta fication

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:40,779
all right so now we get to caching

00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:44,269
plugins maybe you've heard about caching

00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:46,850
the basic idea is that you just want the

00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,830
server to render and output whatever

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,200
it's going to do and then you store the

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:55,610
result and the next time you can just

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,950
give them that saved result and so there

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,340
are two really big caching plugins in

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:04,490
the space there's WP super cache and w3

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,860
total cache and they sound kind of

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,919
similar but they're they're pretty

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,259
different WP super cache is definitely

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,389
simpler when you first enable it and

00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,980
turn it on so the good thing is is you

00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,240
know you have sort of less options to

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,909
look at

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,330
however it also does less so it is a

00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:26,029
simpler plug-in actually it does page

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,100
caching and that's great if that's all

00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,799
you need you know so will you go to a

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,539
page if you're not logged into WordPress

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,009
it will save that out and it will serve

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:37,220
that same page to everybody and

00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,289
sometimes that works fine and and so

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,990
that's that's sort of your basic it

00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,960
doesn't cache things from the database

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,549
it doesn't cache objects or code and

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,350
WordPress on your site things that it

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,669
generates intermediate results it

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,490
doesn't do that it just does the page

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,259
just HTML and then it serves that fast

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,279
and so that's that initial time to first

00:20:54,259 --> 00:21:00,019
byte that's what we're optimizing here

00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,610
w3 total cache the great thing about w3

00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:02,269
total cache is it's got a lot of

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,879
features

00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:08,840
the problem with w3 total cache is that

00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:11,029
it's got a lot of features yeah and and

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,159
it does it does have a page cache it

00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,559
also caches objects it caches things

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,159
from the database it is the all-singing

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,330
all-dancing bear it does all the things

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,830
you have to go through and configure it

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,039
you have to be very careful with it you

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,480
have to know what all these options are

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,519
but if you have a complicated site it

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,019
might be worth that pain to get that

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,700
payoff to speed up things you wouldn't

00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,019
otherwise be able to speed up if you

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,840
have a simple site you probably don't

00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:37,789
need it at all it also has a minify ER

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,710
built in you never use the minify ER

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,600
I've never had luck with the minify ER

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,700
that's built into w3 total cache that's

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,420
why I recommended to other manna fires

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,440
before I even got to it

00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,140
yeah just don't even turn that on

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,760
pretend it's not there you know if it

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,790
works for you great I've never seen it

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,530
work but other than that it's a great

00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:00,250
plugin I don't know why the minifiers

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,410
busted and then for the object caching

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,060
specifically if you're programming in

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,730
WordPress you can also use the

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,220
transients API so if you're a developer

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,590
it's a way to sort of store information

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,240
for those intermediate results and then

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,160
that way they will show up in the object

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,200
cache so if you're aware of that if you

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,180
know you need that you can program to be

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,680
aware of putting things in the object

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,340
cache when you're using w3 total cache

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,170
that's sort of an advanced tip also if

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,880
you're doing that there are different

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,350
backends for the object cache so these

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,320
are other programs that store that

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,750
information I like to use memcached it's

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,610
pretty simple it's a basic key value

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,550
store so you're you know looking up data

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,750
by name in memcache and usually that's

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,670
pretty good you would have to also

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,530
configure that on your server to run and

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,180
then it would show up in w3 total cache

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,220
and you could say use memcache for the

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,480
object cache so again if you know you

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,480
need that that's useful

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,929
so you do all this and it's still slow

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,670
you've done everything you can do you

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,090
don't know why it's still slow

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,400
maybe it's your post if you're on shared

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,929
hosting don't use shared hosting it

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,150
could be somebody else's on your server

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,950
slowing you down and the reason you got

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,780
a cheap deal on that web post is because

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,280
of that is because there's eight other

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,140
people and one of them has a big site

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,400
and it's just falling all over I don't

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,200
think that's as much of a problem as it

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,450
used to be but it used to be people were

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,210
just on qi posts and it could be very

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,960
slow for that reason you know and

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,309
sometimes you do get what you pay for

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,630
for the web server if you control your

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,929
environment

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,210
consider using nginx over Apache Apache

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:43,210
was sort of the default web server that

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,860
everybody used for a long time and nginx

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,750
came out later and it didn't have as

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,080
many of the features as they had maybe

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,179
90% of the features than Apache Apache

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,620
is very full-featured but nginx was a

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,110
lot faster it was just focused on

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,429
performance so you know if you if you

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,040
know what all those letter mean letters

00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:02,020
mean then consider setting up nginx on

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,669
your server otherwise go to a host that

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,880
does it for you and see if that says

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,340
that when you signed up for that host

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,190
along with nginx it plays well with PHP

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,250
fpm which is a specific server for

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,980
running PHP and so those two together

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,630
very speedy combination that's just

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,110
pretty good out of the box they work

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:25,570
well together if you do all that and

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,240
things are still slow there's another

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,650
static page cache that it again runs as

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,760
a server in front of your web server

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:37,360
called varnish and you can set that up

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,160
and if varnish is too hard to configure

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,870
which it usually is varnish is pretty

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,309
complicated you don't always know what

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,710
it cache is you don't always know how to

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:46,630
flush the cache if you figure all that

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,919
out you're probably a varnish expert at

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,270
that point you should probably start a

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,030
company like fastly because they've

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,590
already done this they just put their

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,100
varnish servers in front of your server

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,190
and you can use it as a service

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,290
CloudFlare in general works the same way

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,510
it but it's it's sort of in the CDN

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,580
market cloud far is an interesting

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,470
company because they started out trying

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,880
to be a security company and they said

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,560
we're going to protect people from it

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,450
tax and people were like we don't really

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,730
care about that but you sped up our

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,720
website and we like that and so Clara

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,060
was like we're gonna speed up your

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,570
website they pivoted they changed that

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,640
entirely but but they they start out as

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,020
a free service and you can have cloud

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,870
four in front of your website and it'll

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,580
speed it up or if their servers are down

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,870
then you'll see a notice the cloud four

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,220
servers are down this is the problem

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,780
with having somebody else's server in

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,940
front of your server I've seen that

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,720
notice before too but I expect on

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,850
balance usually it's faster

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,950
there's also see DNS I should mention

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,510
CDN stands for content delivery network

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,430
the idea is that they have a lot of

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,410
servers all over the globe and it tries

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,200
to use the closest one geographically to

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,850
where your users are so if you have a

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,220
web server that's in England and I'm in

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,630
California but you're on a CDN then

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,720
maybe it fetches it from closer to

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,220
California because it has just different

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,900
servers where they've mirrored all your

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,800
content so that can go out and find it

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,410
that's what that service is there is in

00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,540
the jetpack plugin there is a free image

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,340
CDN called Photon

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,410
and so if you're using that it will

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,210
store your images on their servers and

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,830
that will speed things up and so you can

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,870
just try that out and see if it works

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,200
for you if you have slow images and see

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,160
if that speeds it up also way back in

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,250
the beginning when I mentioned the

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,260
waterfall tools this is a test you can

00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,900
actually use them to test from different

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,970
locations so in ping Dom you can say try

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,500
it from the west coast and it will use a

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,840
server there and tell you the speed from

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,400
there so if you are concerned or you

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:53,020
know your customers live somewhere else

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:55,230
you can try that up yes excellent right

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,230
right

00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:11,210
nice yeah yeah if you if you already

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,190
have jetpack try it out you know because

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,219
it costs you nothing to just check that

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,109
bucks and photon and and see if it works

00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:19,789
and see if it speed things up and that's

00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,869
by far the easier solution if you're

00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:25,309
just doing it yourself you know if on

00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,139
the other hand you want to speed up the

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,149
whole site if you know there are slow

00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:32,119
other things that are slow other you

00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:33,409
know CSS JavaScript and it's not the

00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,359
images that are the problem

00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,830
then consider CloudFlare because photon

00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:49,759
will do nothing for the rest of it it

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:51,440
just is an image CDN right yeah yeah

00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,059
CloudFlare is like just having something

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,969
in front of your web server that serves

00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,009
all your content but it does it from

00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:59,659
different locations and so it

00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,149
geographically tries to be smart and

00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,830
pick the best one if it knows that my IP

00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:06,139
address is coming from somewhere else

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,509
right yeah cloud floor is everything

00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:10,399
yeah

00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,349
photon is just images but if images are

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,279
the problem maybe photon is enough so

00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:19,009
that that's sort of the trade-off and so

00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,919
if you've done all that and things are

00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,119
still slow maybe you've optimized your

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,609
website and you just have a lot of

00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,749
traffic maybe you're really popular this

00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,609
is not a bad problem and a half

00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:30,379
hopefully you're making money on this if

00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:32,960
you've got a website that operates that

00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:34,219
at a large scale and at that point you

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,710
can afford to invest more in

00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:40,099
infrastructure and so then we're talking

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,679
about scaling out and so maybe you need

00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:44,299
separate or multiple front end servers

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,999
maybe you need different servers serving

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,589
the PHP and the images even though you

00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:51,139
have the CD ends the CD ends eventually

00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:52,609
have to talk back to your server and so

00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:54,440
you're still getting traffic you're not

00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,759
getting as much traffic but it still

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,729
needs to be fresh it still needs to

00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,830
update sometimes or if you have like a

00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:02,359
membership site if everybody logs in it

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,369
might not be able to cache as much

00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,889
because you need specific profile

00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,239
information you need you know and so it

00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,040
can't cache all that if it's like my

00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,200
user isn't the same

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,300
as your user so like Facebook you know

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,740
they operate at scale everybody sees

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,510
something different that's a hard

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,950
problem that's a lot of you know sort of

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,510
combinations of things

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,160
everybody's wall looks different they

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,900
change it all the time that's hard to

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,060
cache you can't do a static page cache

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,860
for a long you know maybe you can do

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,350
that for like 30 seconds but you know

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,740
you can't do it for 15 minutes as people

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,860
are still refreshing it

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,510
there's hyper DB which is again sort of

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,400
low and the WordPress stack it's

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,220
something that you can put in there for

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,740
talking to the database for partitioning

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,420
and replication hopefully if you if you

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,680
you know if you can figure out what I'm

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,620
talking about there you know you might

00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,000
know about it or need it the idea is

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,610
that you know if you have a wordpress

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,260
multi-user site you might have different

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,360
different sites that are on sort of like

00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,830
different databases and hyper DB is how

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,680
you would do that so you could say like

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,230
on this you know on this mu site you've

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,740
got like 200 servers on the site so

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,970
maybe 20 of them are over on one

00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,710
database server and 20 are over on

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,330
another and you can you can parcel it

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,790
out like that so that's sort of scaling

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:24,280
out on AWS on Amazon Web Services they

00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,080
have a product called Aurora they can do

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,270
database clustering so it'll look like

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,070
one database but it's actually multiple

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,560
servers clustered together and they can

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,910
have multiple readers and writers and so

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,220
you can have just sort of different

00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,450
servers serving that so even though it

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,040
looks like you're just talking to one

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,510
instance it's actually faster because

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,640
it's coming back faster because they

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,590
have multiple servers on the back so

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,410
that's sort of again high level scaling

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,940
but that is an option I mean you could

00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,980
do that you could set that up you could

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,840
completely over engineer your blog on

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,310
Amazon Web Services and be ready to

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,390
operate at scale and then realize you're

00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,180
just paying too much money because

00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,810
you're not getting that much traffic yet

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,810
or maybe you need it

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:12,070
and so that that sort of concludes the

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,740
the basic performance optimization piece

00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,440
but I wanted to talk a little about sort

00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,840
of more more technical with the

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,690
WordPress REST API it's possible to just

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,159
dynamically pull in content so even if

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,320
you have a static page if you know you

00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,840
have one dynamic element you can have

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,940
the REST API pull that in and so the

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,340
example I wanted to use was something

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,929
like a fortune like a fortune cookie or

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,280
like a quote maybe you have something

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,980
that you ran and we want to rotate on a

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,390
page typically that doesn't work well

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,030
with a static page cache you know you

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,669
wrote all this this PHP code or somebody

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,350
did to get a random quote you installed

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,669
your static page cache and now it's the

00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,799
same quote all the time or it's the same

00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:55,220
quote for an hour because it cached that

00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:56,720
static page and so this is an example of

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,360
how you could do this with the REST API

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,640
and have it just pull back new content

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,039
every time because that's in JavaScript

00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,230
and the JavaScript is on the client side

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,000
then the client just fetches the new

00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,890
quote every time and they could reload

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
the page every second and pull back a

00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,150
new one but the rest of the page is

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,679
still static so the page loads fast and

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:21,320
then that content pops in and so this is

00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,049
if you go to github.com slash p bayless

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,120
you'll see this WCA VL fortune repo

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:27,409
there's one file in it I'm going to go

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,900
move for most of it in the next couple

00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:33,250
slides if you don't understand what's

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,250
going on there don't worry about it

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,730
so the first thing you do with a post

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,190
type is you register your post type and

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,170
the key thing here is there's this show

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,140
in rest flag when you register a post

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:51,210
type and if you set it to true then you

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,740
can use that in the rest api and if you

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,930
don't then you're gonna be like why is

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,870
the rest api broken I can't see my post

00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,520
type and it's because you didn't do that

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,800
and so that's the the key thing if you

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,330
want to use the REST API to pull posts

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,000
out of a post type it has to have that

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,890
show and rest flag set to true when you

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,380
register that post type so here I'm

00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,950
registering a post type called WCA vo

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,530
underscore fortune and then when you do

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,000
that you'll see like a fortune label and

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,610
the WordPress admin and then you can

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,290
post fortune posts as that's your basic

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,840
how you create a post type and you would

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:27,290
have that code in a plugin which I have

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,290
on that github

00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,919
and then this is your basic code to

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,690
fetch one of those fortune posts I put

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,210
this in jQuery because this is actually

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,730
shorter if I had written it out and just

00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,990
raw JavaScript it would be longer I'll

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,400
show you that next and we'll just

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,510
completely gloss over it because it's

00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,250
way too long to just read on a slide but

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,940
yeah here you have you have a div at the

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,200
top it says show fortune I gave it an ID

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,910
and then you're going to put content

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,590
into that dip so that's your placeholder

00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,110
so this is still static you have a

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,090
static div it has nothing in it and then

00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,399
this is your script and then in the

00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:11,250
script you see that Ajax right there

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,520
that does your Ajax request it pulls it

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,590
in from a URL on your website the slash

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,000
WordPress slash is actually hard-coded I

00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,260
probably should have done that but

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,389
that's where my wordpress installation

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,159
lives if you're doing this right you

00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:26,639
would want to use something like a site

00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,379
URL and pull that in and then you have

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,560
the rest of the URL to it and so that's

00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,359
your usual REST API URL so the WP JSON I

00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,790
told you about JSON before it pulls

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,840
things back in the JSON object model is

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:42,270
a JavaScript variable slash WP / uh v2

00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,899
slash and then the name of my post types

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:47,970
there's the WCA BL fortune and then

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,889
slash question mark and then we have the

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,929
options for pulling things out and so

00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,210
this is what you'd see in WP query so

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:56,820
that's the post per page the offset and

00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:00,960
so I'm saying where pagination is one

00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:03,570
the only want one page one one post the

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,859
offset is how far you seek in there and

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,020
so like maybe you're just going through

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:08,400
like three posts or something but I

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,230
don't have that set to a number because

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,210
if I hard-coded it to three you would

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,190
see the same post every time and so I

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,100
have some code here some more JavaScript

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,990
to say okay I want a random number and

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,690
then multiply that by the total posts

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,550
and give it to me as an integer and so

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,430
say like and then that might come up

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,320
with post three or my caliph was four

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:30,930
and then it fetches that post data and

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,690
once it's done we shoved that post data

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,670
back into the show fortune div and then

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,359
it just pops in and so that's the basic

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,890
idea behind this code and so that that's

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,480
sort of the the amount of effort

00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,480
required to do something like that

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,569
or if you weren't using jQuery it would

00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:55,460
look more like that and that probably

00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:57,339
looks like more work and you know

00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,599
actually I can still read that from here

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:01,910
I was thinking I would have a smaller

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,069
screen but that's still probably too

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,859
much to go through on the slide so yeah

00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,940
that's why people use jQuery folks

00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,619
everybody's like oh you can write it in

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,230
raw JavaScript it's the same thing it's

00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:15,260
great like you're writing more more

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,730
letters so it's that trade-off you know

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,859
do you want to spend the time loading

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,140
the jQuery library on the front and then

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,910
having to wait for that file to load or

00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,609
do you want to spend your time writing

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,079
longer code and then you know waiting

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,000
for that and you're like well it's it's

00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,490
less kilobytes yeah but but you spent

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,839
time doing it so there's always sort of

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,369
that trade-off between the libraries

00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,410
that help you and more code to load in

00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,460
on the front versus more code for you to

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:47,029
write because you didn't use that

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:50,900
library now we talked about the rest API

00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:52,640
and the rest API is great but there's

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,160
some overhead to it because every time

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,990
you make a REST API call in WordPress it

00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,819
has already loaded all your plugins it

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,400
has already loaded the theme and I told

00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:03,559
you guys I just want one post out of

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,390
this fortune post type do I need an SEO

00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,260
plugin for that do I need a caching

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,240
plugin for that

00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm not cashing in I'm just I'm pulling

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,410
the post back so there may be some you

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,940
need there may be some you don't and you

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,819
want to sort of step back and look at

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,980
that and say okay is this fast enough or

00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,779
do I need to make it faster is it taking

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,369
too long for that quote to pop in and it

00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:25,599
is it taking two seconds to load all my

00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:28,700
plugins and my theme every time and so

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,230
this gets pretty technical and that

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,079
you'd need to create a must use plug-in

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:35,150
to be able to override other plugins and

00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,450
so that that shows up in the WP content

00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,650
/mu plugins directory

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,940
most of the time you know if you don't

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,470
know what a mute plug-in is you probably

00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,670
don't want to be writing one because

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,829
that's getting just sort of into the

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,990
more dangerous it's basically a plugin

00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:49,609
you can't deactivate it's always running

00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,309
you don't even necessarily see it on the

00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:54,710
plugins list there is a tab for it but

00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:56,900
you might not even notice and so it's

00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,740
just for things that you always want to

00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,599
run

00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,329
and in this case it would just be very

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,599
short and it would just check and say is

00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:08,060
this URL going into the rest API if so

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,700
maybe what rest api call is it you know

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,670
is it this fortune one and then if so

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,320
don't run these other plugins and it's

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,599
powerful it can do that because it loads

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,079
before the plugins load so it can tell

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,640
WordPress not to load things and so

00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,829
that's what this option actually active

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,359
plugins filter is the active plugins

00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:28,640
option controls all the plugins that

00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:30,410
load and so you can grab that and you

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,240
can manipulate it before the plugins

00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,010
load and say don't load this one I know

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,619
this is slow I don't need it for the

00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,359
rest call I'm gonna just deactivate it

00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:40,369
it doesn't deactivate the plug-in like

00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,960
in the admin it's just temporarily for

00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,810
that request that plug-in just doesn't

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,540
even load and no one's the wiser because

00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:49,220
you decided I don't need it for this and

00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,349
so that's just getting sort of into the

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,700
into the weeds of the fine tuning of

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:54,550
WordPress but that's what you do when

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,349
you really need to speed things up

00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,930
there's also a constant and WordPress

00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:02,510
called doing Ajax that was used sort of

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,380
in the legacy previous Ajax system if

00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,940
you remember WP admin had been ajax

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,890
that's where we used to do Ajax calls

00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,660
and that still has a lot of code and

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,369
WordPress where it would say oh you're

00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,319
doing Ajax you don't need to do this and

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,940
so you could set that and that would

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,369
also speed things up before the REST API

00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,710
even loads in that same way so that's

00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,329
sort of another hack that you can do if

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,710
you need to really speed up a REST API

00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:30,079
call also going even deeper than that

00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,849
you can have a standalone PHP script

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,099
just for doing REST API eyes and bypass

00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,410
the REST API entirely and there's a

00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,750
short NIT constant and that if you

00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,609
enable that first it doesn't even load

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,859
the plugins it doesn't load the theme it

00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:44,240
doesn't learn most of WordPress but if

00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:45,710
all you need is a post you might be able

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,660
to pull out a post with a little bit of

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,760
WordPress it does load so that's super

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,800
fast but it also gives you almost no

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,630
functionality and you're hitting just

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,730
like a standalone PHP script that's just

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,319
barely talking to WordPress so I'd say

00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,359
for most use cases you don't even need

00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,369
that that's probably overkill but if it

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,650
has to be really fast I was actually

00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,060
talking to Michael Wood earlier and he

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,470
was telling me a use case for this and

00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,260
I'm just gonna steal this and tell you

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,000
and it was like an autocomplete you know

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,870
so you know when you're live typing

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,030
and then it comes up with the

00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:16,640
suggestions but updates every time you

00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,990
press a key they needed to do that short

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,120
net solution because that was the only

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,650
way it could be that fast because if it

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,900
took a second or two seconds to load a

00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,100
theme or all the plugins and every time

00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,630
you're waiting to see what happens when

00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,920
you press that key you would not use

00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,510
that autocomplete you would not type

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,370
into that search field but if it comes

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,090
back in 50 milliseconds you can type

00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,250
just fine

00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,760
and so that was the use case and so it

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:40,220
doesn't happen often but it can't happen

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,220
and then you can also cache responses

00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,530
from the REST API so for this fortune

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,180
example maybe you've already seen this

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,320
quote before but it pulls it in again

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,610
when you reload the page because maybe

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,320
you've gone through all the quotes and

00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,870
so then it would pull it back faster

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,330
because it's seen that REST API call and

00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:59,090
so there's a plug-in called WP rest

00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,340
cache I don't personally use this

00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,720
because I have sort of a custom solution

00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,460
I did where I actually sort of

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,130
compressed the things first and it's a

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,950
little complicated but for simple rest

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,330
calls it's great and it actually adds

00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,030
some filters in front so there's this

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:16,760
rush rest cache headers filter where you

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,890
can actually send special headers to the

00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,020
browser and say like you know I want to

00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,000
cache this for 900 seconds or something

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,010
you can just specifically control that

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,010
and that's a nice feature that they

00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:30,230
added and so I'd say like as a developer

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,670
it's useful sort of looking into that WP

00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,100
rest cache plugin and seeing what they

00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:37,150
did and how they did it you know at

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,150
least does an example

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,790
all right so at this point we're

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,230
probably overdue for questions anything

00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,700
you guys want to know about or talk to

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,310
me about or questions you have about

00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,450
your site doesn't have to be you know

00:41:51,310 --> 00:42:00,760
hopefully you're talking about speeding

00:41:52,450 --> 00:42:01,810
it up but other than that anything I'm

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,130
just going to assume I went through all

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:12,900
the things and did a great job but feel

00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:12,900
