Description: 
	SVG may have been overlooked in the past due to poor browser support, however, SVG1.1 is now fully supported in all evergreen browsers. SVG is crisp on any screen, responsive by nature and is seriously cool, with nifty features like grouping, stoke and fill, and filters. Oh and the ability to easily animate, Who doesn’t love a good SVG animation?
Even if you’ve never used SVG before, come learn how to get started with this amazing element. We’ll see what all those features actually do, we’ll look at how all that code in an SVG file draws a shape and best practices for formatting your SVG code.
Takeaways:
In this talk, we will discuss the why, when, and how of using SVG’s (Scalable Vector Graphics) in your project. At code42, we decided to exclusively use SVG’s for iconography and logos across all our production websites. I will share what we learned throughout this process, the use cases, edge cases, best cases, and worst cases. Also, we will take an in-depth look at the anatomy of an SVG. Finally, we will compare capabilities SVG vs .png, CSS, JavaScript. You will leave this talk excited and prepared to implement SVG’s in your next project.
