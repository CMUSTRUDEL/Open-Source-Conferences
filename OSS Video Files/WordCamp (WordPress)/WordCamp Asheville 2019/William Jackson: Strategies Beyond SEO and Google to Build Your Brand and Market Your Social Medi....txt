awesomeness from within you for social

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,159
media so as we go through this I always

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,890
tell my kids at school kindergarten to

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,950
the apartments they are fantastic

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,860
these are several features of what I'm

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,789
doing a community and spark has work

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,380
camp technology teaching and steam but

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,319
one of the most important parts is

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,140
brighten them myself my girlfriend could

00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,130
be travel for work camps all over we've

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,640
been in Calgary we tend to Costa Rica

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:59,549
obviously were here this all summer camp

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,849
Jacksonville things are Atlanta so we

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,590
travel around a lot to attend and to

00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,950
meet awesome people such as yourselves

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,569
and the primary reason is to share

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,700
information that we've learned from

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,709
other work camps and the information I

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,019
be receiving we like to share with other

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,010
people to build up your awesome so it's

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,209
like kind of giving back to the

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:26,609
community so some pictures starting to

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:28,200
limit who is this that's me maybe that's

00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,600
a concept for one of the first graders

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,100
that drew me okay that was your idea

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,350
about me I also volunteer for TEDx for

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,780
State College in Jacksonville I help

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,959
with their social media social you serve

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,129
silent

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:49,790
and then shielded them to what brain is

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,150
that from our so we understand the

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:58,069
symbology of different brands so your

00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:01,340
brand is you but also your logo so we

00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,810
never go cheap on your logo because when

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,209
you put stuff on the internet doesn't

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,040
ever go away no it's always there

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,140
because I might eventually it's gonna

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
copy to get computer or to your phone

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,370
and it may bring it up later but you

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,470
take to logo we change the brand so

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,340
don't confuse them if you're going to

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,470
have a logo click the money out

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,390
professionally have your local done the

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,959
right way so if you're comfortable with

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,859
it and put the top obviously education I

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,170
eat and I are also for bloggers so we

00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,000
1040 Venice and we bought about their

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,190
family events that they have and a

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,459
sponsor now why did I bring that up

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,310
because it's all engagement in the

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:47,569
community is things that we love to do

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,419
so I'm encouraging you and the ink of

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,609
this work and others find what your

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,799
passion is and share your passion with

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:56,780
others so you're building your brand

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,569
you're building the kinds of that work

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,940
camps are fun your engagement is fun

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,950
having a business is fun even though you

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,290
have a lot of challenges so if you look

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,989
up you think about this information

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,389
I love empirically skip some valuable

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:15,319
information and everyone smile in PR

00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,900
moment bringing in good and pure awesome

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,630
so one of the things is 50 beta users

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,430
how long did it take this to happen I

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,660
remember when I was little television

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,990
from one date myself and 12 o'clock on

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,990
the night

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,229
sound that made this time would be

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,979
economy that's because team is develop

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,250
okay

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:47,530
so stuff also how long it take between

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:50,620
users or okay Pepperell TV the internet

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,729
so who was faster in this case who's

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,190
faster we know today

00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,590
internet because the Internet is global

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,330
access and I try to teach my students

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,360
and when I go to conferences to speak to

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,259
have a global perspective of the world

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,770
and be inclusive and recognize the

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,539
diversity that Internet provides because

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,030
sometimes we forget about that we're in

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:15,819
our local area or networking the people

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,550
that we know and talk like us and look

00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:21,430
like us to think like us but you have to

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,830
remember the world is so diverse you

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,469
never know if you want to miss the

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,449
opportunity of meeting somebody next to

00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:30,430
you from another state of another

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,849
country that you can collaborate with

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,400
and it's always great to collaborate as

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,169
opposed to compete because when you

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,870
collaborate you both win

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,419
you know you spread your event your and

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,580
you empower your brand so it's very

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:49,389
important that you're not going to

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:52,750
collaborate so find your tribe goes in

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,360
your tribe who can you connect to that's

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,610
different than you because you share the

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,949
same passion all of us are in here

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,810
because we share a passion one of the

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,150
open source community where we can come

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,969
together and sit another peace and calm

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,650
and intelligence and passion to get as

00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,419
much information as we can because young

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,219
lady they came before me some has

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,500
information about breakfast I did not

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:17,440
understand but now I have to go back to

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,949
my whole blogs and make sure I have my

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,870
tags correct for all my damages the

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,240
other part is closer than that just

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,880
popping up then globally and be

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,830
authentic in what you're doing don't

00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,810
copy other people why would you copy

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,020
somebody else and I got to tell my kids

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,380

of people in the world it was only one

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,839

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,530
because you should kill me network

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,340
amongst each other and share information

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:29,020
we you know someone has some content

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,510
make sure you share it with that person

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,450
the things that you learned you share

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:40,060
with others why keep it to you because

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:43,570
we're all here to share thanksfully one

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,610
here how many use a bigger than that

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,980
amount of knowledge

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,740
build your dream and take the places

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,820
that you never knew that you could go

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,980
before now I'm in my fifties so I'm not

00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,550
scared to talk to sewing in the 20s and

00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,860
30s

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,450
because I can share information with

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,329
them that I can also get information

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,779
from them and I'm also smart enough for

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:08,950
that one day they may be a customer or

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,170
an employee

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,329
so sometimes it's good to get out of

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,589
your box of comfort to meet other people

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:21,070
greet other people and share information

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:26,110
the right brand commands strengthen your

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:28,000
brand to command attention if you're a

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,600
business you have to get people's

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,970
attention

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,490
who you are what services you provide

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,880
what can you give that person what a

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,940
problem can keep some create the right

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,000
great brand and strategically you have

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,950
to be strategic about what you're doing

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,839
marketing is important but you may not

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,850
have to use all the social media

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,000
platforms in the world that should pick

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,800
the ones that are most effective for you

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,490
but it also takes you sitting down and

00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,910
being strategic and planning what you

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,680
need to do to be successful and we all

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,190
have some level of patience in there

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,810
right

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,880
I have a lot of patience when I'm going

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,980
to kindergarten first grade and trying

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,199
to line them up in a box like herding

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,880
cats you may have heard it before but

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:15,160
you have to be real careful and

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,940
strategic about what you're going where

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:24,490
your information goes brand is just a

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,190
perception but what type of perception

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,329
are you creating to brand so I'm going

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,329
to give you a homework assignment

00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:34,209
this your home or side if you have kids

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:38,829
grandkids nephews or nieces your

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:41,820
homework assignment is to ask them what

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,470
their perception is of your business

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,080
or what you're trying to accomplish in

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,320
the business

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,019
world or your profession and ask them to

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,970
be honest as you know about do you think

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,220
I was built at all no just say because

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,029
on the top of your head and that gives

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,519
you an idea you may be creating one type

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,899
of perception but that may not be the

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,680
perception that other people are

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:09,459
perceiving that you're trying to protect

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,560
so you do Facebook Instagram Twitter

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:15,380
whatever it is what are you using to

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,459
project your brand and what are you

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,839
doing that is correct or incorrect it's

00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,940
always good to find out what you're

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,940
going right and what you're doing wrong

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:34,310
and lastly never forget that people

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,529
again are watching you and I almost like

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:40,339
to tell my kids when I'm walking into

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:43,459
Walmart I have to be very careful of how

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:46,040
I behave and how I act as a professional

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:49,040
educator because I never know who's

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,190
watching me whether it's a pencil

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,910
another teacher a student or a parent

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:59,329
because one of us LaBeouf could destroy

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,490
my brand and my reputation so it's very

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,829
important that you have the perception

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,290
in your mind yes you have your personal

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,810
life the issue of your business life but

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,420
in this day and age of technology is all

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,760
combined

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,010
for example and thank you for watching

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,630
this presentation and being the rock and

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,900
all that provides us with some good

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,900
