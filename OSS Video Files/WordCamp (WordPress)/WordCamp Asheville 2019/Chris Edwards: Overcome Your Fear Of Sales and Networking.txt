all right we'll go and get started here

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,910
how's everyone doing today pretty good

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,190
pretty good

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,539
everybody enjoying the I guess actually

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,630
this is the second day with the

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,490
workshops of working awesome awesome all

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,500
right well I just kind of started out

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,900
here this could be an idea of what the

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,550
talk is going to be it's gonna be about

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,980
overcoming your fear of sales and

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,790
networking it's gonna be kind of driven

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,129
more towards people who are introverted

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,739
you know people who are not big fans of

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:50,820
large crowds or can't walk into a crowd

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:52,590
and just you know be just walk into a

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,350
crowd and be social right it's always a

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,370
little harder and the reason I just kind

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,739
of real quick the reason I were at this

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,440
talk was you know I was a freelancer I

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,899
had to learn I'm one of those people

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,760
walked in and went and found the corner

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,049
found one person I knew and stood over

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,090
there the whole time I never talked to

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,340
anybody well listen to grow my business

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,390
that way and so I had to learn how to

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,470
talk to people and how to do sales when

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,150
frankly I didn't want to be near anybody

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,890
and talk to people it kind of scared me

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,950
so that's kind of what this sauce gonna

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:29,189
be about so first off I'm Chris Edwards

okay so for today's talk kind of give

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,420
you a little bit of an outline of what

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,830
we're gonna be talking about so we're

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,500
gonna kind of go through first off the

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,570
mentality you need to have then followed

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,880
by where we're gonna talk about knowing

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,040
your limits how to start the

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,350
conversation and then how to turn a

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,750
conversation into a sales conversation

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,270
to sell a product and even how to close

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,500
that deal and then thinking we're gonna

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,740
kind of go through and we're going to

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,150
talk about sales tools and and such if

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,130
you can hold questions to the end that'd

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,530
be great if you do have a you know

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,590
really a big question you want to try to

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,160
ask feel free to raise your hand and

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,930
we'll try to answer it okay so let's

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,800
start off first with the buying set

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,600
right everybody when you say I say you

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,850
know you're like oh well let's talk

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,230
about a salesperson right or we're gonna

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,970
talk to sales everyone starts to kind of

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,040
think of that car salesman like kind of

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,330
person it's like that he said that he

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,070
doesn't care about you he just wants to

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,620
walk in it's gonna sell you a car

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,450
whatever it takes is gonna you know

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,070
pressure you into it and everything and

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,720
what we want to do is we want to keep

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,370
that mindset because if you have that

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,860
mindset especially if you're introvert a

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,959
lot of times as an introvert you're kind

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,430
of a little bit more about you don't

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,709
want to chase people off you don't want

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,870
to scare people you want to please

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,190
people and so the idea is instantly

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,630
you're turned away from sales cuz you're

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,920
like I'm not that kind of person I don't

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,830
want to get involved and I want to walk

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,750
up and be like take this buy this do

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,600
this you're just not that kind of person

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,709
and so you and you start to think of

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,870
sales you start to think of that car

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,180
salesman type of attitude and that's

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,580
actually not the mindset that you need

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,950
to have going into this instead what you

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,860
gonna do is you're gonna look at it as

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,570
you're consulting right so instead of

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,299
focusing on selling you want to focus

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,330
kind of more on consulting oh you're

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,610
there to help them not sell product so

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,579
this is the first big thing to come in

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,100
because naturally if you go in with a

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,560
Salesman tality of just push push push

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,790
push you're gonna really be scared of

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
having those conversations you're not

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,120
gonna want to have that conversation

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,560
with people and and it's gonna really

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,510
make you uncomfortable which students

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,789
gonna make it very hard to make a sale

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,330
right so one of the biggest things I

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,240
always like

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,979
is go in there and just be yourself help

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,289
them you're an expert and what you do

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,340
that's why you do it for a living so go

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,219
up and just talk to them

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,569
and just be helpful and don't don't

00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,620
don't think about selling their own

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,060
product that's something I can come

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,949
later we can talk about that later with

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,599
them just find out and just just be

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,800
there to help and if you have that

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,509
mentality you're just helping people

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,789
that you're not trying to sell things

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,590
you're not trying to do any of that it's

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,520
gonna make it a lot easier to go in

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,629
there because you're not gonna be

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,000
nervous you're not gonna be thinking Oh

00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:58,530
am I gonna am I not gonna I'm not gonna

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,590
sell something which is kind of really

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,289
good our next point right rejection it

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,810
happens right it's real you don't need

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,229
to worry about it I often look at it as

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,969
a way to learn from it right people

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,770
aren't always going to want what you're

00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,479
selling right so if you come in with the

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,909
mentality to help them you're not

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,669
sitting here worried about oh do they

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,500
want to buy what I'm selling and you're

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,490
not worried about that rejection because

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,080
you're just there to help you're there

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,319
to do what you know help them out with

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,229
what they need it's gonna really help

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,550
you build that relationship being closer

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:39,960
right so just kind of remember I say

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,740
remember I heard this from for you which

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,569
it was another word camp someone said

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,960
remember every rejection is one step

00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:52,650
closer to a yes and so and I enjoyed

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,000
that quote because it was really it kind

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,169
of told me you know that's true when

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,800
you're talking to somebody and they say

00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,409
I'm not interested I don't want that it

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,969
really kind of helps you understand okay

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:04,710
well they didn't want it lets me get

00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:06,270
move on to the next person who may want

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,250
that product or it helps you understand

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,289
what they may really want and then maybe

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:16,229
you can talk to them about a service you

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:18,900
have for that and then just kind of

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,180
remember this is a relationship building

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,659
thing right you're not gonna just walk

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,370
in this isn't a okay I got five minutes

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,050
to make a say on how to move on this is

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,240
gonna you want to focus on building that

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,800
relationship with somebody it's it's

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,229
you're not gonna close every single cell

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,669
on the first encounter it may take

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,319
multiple encounters but instead you want

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,849
just but work on building a relationship

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,249
and some be a little bit easier if you

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,699
walk in to a conversation with some

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,139
buddy and you are in that mindset that

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,789
I'm gonna help them you're not worried

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,619
about that rejection right and then

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,329
you're not sitting here just instantly

00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,909
like yeah yeah that's great it's great

00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,919
great hey buy my stuff right they're not

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,199
going they're gonna be like whoa you

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
know a little too quick there so instead

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,169
just sit there and just talk to them

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,079
build a solid relationship with those

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,759
people and just really get to know what

00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,189
they're looking for and understand and

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,559
just focus on the relationship aspect

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:16,499
not the sales aspect and then know your

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:18,209
limit don't overwhelm yourself this is a

00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:23,099
big one for me it's actually kind of

00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:24,659
funny because you'll you'll see this if

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,809
you know me you'll see this happen all

00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:31,469
the time but what will kind of into what

00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:34,469
I mean by that so first group size this

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:36,179
is this is one of those I always say it

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,589
could be one or together right for

00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,419
different depending what kind of

00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,799
personality type you are you may be

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,709
somebody who's more comfortable talking

00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,079
to just one-on-one with people or you

00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,729
may be some get intimidated if there's

00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,689
like five or six people right there you

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,949
might start to get a little more

00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:57,029
intimidated like me speaking to like 35

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:58,979
40 of you but you know it might be a

00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,569
little intimidating right or you might

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,209
thrive on that it might be easier for

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,099
you to talk to a larger group or insert

00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,959
yourself if you see a group of like

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,479
three or four people at a networking

00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,159
event right you see three or four people

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,449
standing over here to just join in with

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,389
that because then you don't have to

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:18,269
completely lead on the conversation

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,649
don't over if you know that a certain

00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,669
one in intimidates you more any other

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:23,039
don't put yourself in that position

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,949
because once you get intimidated once

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,309
you start to feel uncomfortable it's

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:32,789
really really hard to go back and you

00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,439
know come back from that it's gonna be

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,819
here and become overwhelmed you're not

00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,839
gonna your minds not gonna be clear

00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,300
you're not gonna be able sell your

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,229
product you're not gonna build a show

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,669
that you're an expert in your field

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,759
because you're gonna be too busy

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,350
thinking about you know you know just

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,269
being intimidated by the whole situation

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,009
right so what I like to do is focus on a

00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,020
one-on-one conversation with somebody or

00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,790
if you are the group person

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,470
having that group and then learn about

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,500
the different people to that group and

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,980
then focus on a one-on-one conversation

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,140
to start that conversation for sales so

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,400
this is the big one if you know me if

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,050
you see me at word camps

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,720
you'll see there will be a point where

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,330
you just don't see me for a little while

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,790
take breaks right when you need to take

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,960
a break you'll know it you're gonna be

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,780
overwhelmed you're gonna hit a point

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,000
where you can't really you know think

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,010
what's going on you're just you're just

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,980
way overwhelmed with everything going on

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,960
there take a break I know the last year

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,520
we're camper us this this happened to me

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,170
with the large room with everybody there

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,420
I was running around talking to

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,800
everybody and everything and then my

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,750
wife was there as well with me she's

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,790
next River well I should talk about that

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,880
a little bit here but and how that can

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,410
work for your advantage but she's just

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,180
she's loving it she's loving all these

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,560
people she's like this is awesome and

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,030
she's getting me into all these

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,010
conversations we're talking everybody

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,720
and then I come up there and say I'm

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,400
gonna disappear for about an hour I'll

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,430
be back and so I went back to the hotel

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,050
went down went sat down just by the

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,540
window worked on a few things on my

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,980
computer and just silence the silent

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,360
place maybe you can't go back to the

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,330
hotel maybe it's just finding a nice

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,590
quiet place is here for example tons I

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,420
love this place there's so many of the

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,070
different seats there's another level

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,020
you can seek down to and hide if you

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,000
want to you can just kind of find a

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,770
place just to kind of get away even if

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,270
it's in a large networking event finding

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,500
a room that you can step out to or just

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,570
going outside and just walking around

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,880
for a second if you need to collect your

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,500
mind do that because if you don't do

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
that you're gonna have a very unclear

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,670
mind you're gonna be going into this

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,900
super nervous and you're gonna be we're

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,610
gonna see that and you're not going to

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,710
show that you're an expert in that field

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,630
you're not going to show hey I know what

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,010
I'm talking about if in your mind you've

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,180
got twenty other thoughts running

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,670
through your head while you're trying to

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,070
have that conversation with people so

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,410
just find a quiet place recharge take a

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,300
minute grab some water or something and

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,780
just just sit back and just you know

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,260
take a rest speaking of water I gotta

00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,260
have a little bit here

00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:06,509
kind of along those same lines I also

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,179
want to talk about pacing yourself right

00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:12,069
so similar to taking a break when you

00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,539
have a conversation with somebody you

00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:16,269
don't want to just you know now like my

00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,739
wife she just she'll be still talking to

00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,179
this person and starting her second

00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:20,199
conversation with another person how she

00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,989
does I don't know

00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,939
but take a break between people figure

00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:27,009
out how much time you need between to

00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:29,769
reset between each conversation you've

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,889
had with people right so what I like to

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,959
do is after I talk to one person I like

00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,519
to go ahead and take a step back think

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,699
about what I just talked to them about

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,139
maybe write some notes down about them

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,079
and make sure that I just kind of take a

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:46,059
minute to fully understand what I just

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,729
had a conversation about and then I move

00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,949
over to the next person right and then I

00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:53,949
go ahead and start that conversation

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:55,239
with that person and I make sure I have

00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,100
a little bit of time in between I know

00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:59,499
where I'm I know and that's where I can

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,769
assess - Anita break don't even take a

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:04,839
break you know where do I talk to next

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,279
you know just take a minute to really

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,079
clear your mind before jumping into that

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,189
next conversation and it's gonna make it

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:15,299
a lot easier another one this is a big

00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:18,249
one I like to use split the room and

00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,439
this is an interesting because I've told

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,359
this to a few people that are extrovert

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,919
sales people like what do you mean split

00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:26,049
the room I see the room and I just go

00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,689
and I'm like yeah not me I see the room

00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,759
they go whoa no no that's let's not do

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,919
this so what I like to do is kind of

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,929
take the room and go alright let's let's

00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,929
let's let's let's divide this room into

00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:39,339
an to force and I'm really gonna just

00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,899
pretend I'm just gonna look over and

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,369
focus on this section of the room for

00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,869
now I'm not gonna even pay attention to

00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:45,369
what's going on around here because

00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:48,069
there's too many people here and it's

00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:50,529
gonna be very intimidating to just walk

00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:52,389
in and be like oh wow you know and just

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,069
try to where do I go who do I try and

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,939
talk to what's going on I just like to

00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,109
come on kind of go over and figure out

00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:00,909
you know this is the only area I'm

00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,949
focusing on it makes it a little easier

00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:04,569
and that can also be the area that only

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,309
has a couple people in it if you want

00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:08,350
make sure there's nope if you're the

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,059
section has no people then you're not

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,139
really doing it right there so you need

00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,230
to at least make sure there's some

00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:16,840
people in that section right

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,420
all right so this is where we're gonna

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,760
kind of get more into that's kind of the

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,090
mentality I think and kind of how you

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,280
know I like to make sure that I don't

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,850
get overwhelmed when I'm into situations

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,930
now how I start those conversations so I

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,480
told you we're gonna talk about my wife

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,950
here good things don't know how I said

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,680
anything bad right

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:43,120
first get a wing man or a wing woman

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,220
right get somebody who can help you the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,540
easiest way to start a conversation is

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,050
actually to have somebody else do it for

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:54,430
you right finding good leads sending him

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,140
over to your way we do this my wife she

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,270
goes around and she talks like I said to

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,100
everyone in the room and she goes and

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,390
finds all the people she qualifies them

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,850
and she brings them over since let me

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,310
introduce you to Chris Chris Chris works

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,450
with us you know as well let me he could

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,670
tell you a little bit more on the

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,100
technical side about what he does and so

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,810
she's kind of pre pre talk to everybody

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,370
found out people who may be interested

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,170
in having more of a conversation and

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,970
then she brings him over to me and then

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,910
at that point it's a little easier

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,140
because they were brought to me like I

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,760
didn't have to try to find that

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,870
conversation and this doesn't have to be

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,740
a significant other this could be a

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,540
friend business partner partner another

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,120
one that we found recently it worked out

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,790
really well for us was complementary

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,020
business connections that that's a word

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,540
I made up because I couldn't really

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,130
figure out what to call them right so

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,870
when we did a lot of stuff with our

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,080
local chamber and going to a lot of

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,250
local chamber events and that one was a

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,490
really interesting one because people

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,470
not only with being an introvert was it

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,450
a little difficult but everyone's very

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,670
close circled there to like everyone's

00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,950
like no no you can't come talk to us yet

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,600
you haven't been here long enough and so

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,330
what we found was we actually ended up

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,370
talking with a grant a print marketing

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,760
company they didn't do digital marketing

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,190
and so what ended up being is we are

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,080
very and I don't do print marketing but

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,120
we do digital marketing but both are

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,220
needed for a successful marketing

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,680
campaign for a business and so instead

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,240
what they would do is they'd bring us in

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,250
on conversations and be like well let's

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,390
talk about your marketing in general and

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,610
then they would introduce and say you

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,190
know this is this is David Labs

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,570
they do digital marketing as well as we

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,610
help you with your print marketing sign

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,709
and we together we can come up with a

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,510
whole marketing plan and they were able

00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,860
to help bring us in so that's kind of

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,529
what I mean by complementary business

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,180
connections find other people that may

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,670
do stuff that can complement your

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,010
service or your product and work with

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:56,230
them to help start those conversations

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:58,480
and bring those conversations in oh yeah

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,180
and then anyone else who's willing just

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,149
to do it for you you may actually just

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,350
find meet somebody who's like you know

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,760
after talking to somebody and like oh

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,230
yeah yeah you know what I know like five

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,000
people that they were asking me earlier

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,200
I talked to you know this is the

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,180
extrovert that's running around meeting

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,579
everybody right my wife does this for

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,380
people she'll go to different booths out

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,880
at a word camp talk to all these people

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,980
and then bring people back to all these

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,040
different booths I'm like how to get

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,060
commission from these people but she

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,459
goes out and she starts telling

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,750
everybody's product right because she

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,089
starts talking to people and she's like

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,680
well I don't I know somebody so just

00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,019
find anybody who's you know you know if

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,190
you that's part of that going out and

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,560
talking and networking with people

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,959
you're gonna meet people that are going

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,220
to help bring business to you just to

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,170
help you out because they may say I

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,060
don't do that oh you're looking for

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,760
analytic services I don't do analytic

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:52,839
services but I know somebody who does so

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,519
that's kind of the really cool that's

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,800
kind of the whole idea of what I saved

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,320
the wingman you know using somebody to

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,810
help you bring that and now you don't

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,589
always then have that available so

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,709
there's a couple different things like

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,319
to do first make them come to you so

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,669
this is another really easy one well

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,980
it's a little hard but a little easy

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:17,770
right so one of the cool things you can

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:20,410
do is instead of trying to go walk up to

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,839
somebody become that like I died right

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,299
in here the thing you're good at guy or

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,110
girl right so one of the things I do I

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:31,120
give a lot of talks on the analytics I

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,710
analyst nerd a lot of times when I go to

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,990
different camps I actually have people

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:39,920
come up to me and go hey you're that

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:42,830
analytics guy right and I'm like sure

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,900
I guess so right and and so how do you

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,220
get to there there's different ways one

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:51,380
of the things is kind of doing what I'm

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:54,230
doing right now giving talks we're just

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,020
going to follow me giving talks about

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,000
the subjects that you know right so

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,230
everybody here like I said again you're

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,790
an expert in your field

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,130
you really know what you're doing right

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,570
so why not stand up and just talk about

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,480
it it's really easy to talk about

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,000
something you know in depth you can get

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,880
me on to an analytics talk and I've had

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,010
to be I've had what I said oh you got an

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,390
extra you know hour and a half I'm an

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,020
hour and half in and you know I've got

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,340
the moderator tell me because it's

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,500
something I know it's something I really

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,810
really love doing passionate about it

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,490
and so it's one of those talks that

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,660
because I know it's something I can

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,220
easily talk about it and answer

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,260
questions all day long on it well by

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,740
doing that once you walk out in the

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,060
hallway

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,650
and you're walking around the event

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,420
you're gonna have people coming up to

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,590
you and going hey I want you to talk

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,380
I've actually had people come up to me

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,240
who were like hey I was in your talk and

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,030
I'm like I didn't give a talk at this

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,050
event like no no it was like a year and

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,610
a half ago oh okay that's cool I have no

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,580
idea when that was but that's awesome

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,930
right and so it once you started to give

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,420
some of those talks people start to know

00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:03,350
you another way which is really easy way

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:05,390
and I do this a lot at the when I do

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,520
like a networking event or I go to like

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,280
a Chamber event on my nametag

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,360
instead of just writing my name I write

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,620
asked me about and I put in like so when

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,830
we're doing like one with the small

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,280
business chamber I'll say ask me about

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,540
digital marketing and then you get a lot

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,950
of people because what a lot of people

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,620
do is they write their name on their

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,290
nametag but I didn't asked me about now

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,790
when people just see you they go oh yeah

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,200
I was thinking about doing something

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,590
with that let me go talk to this guy

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,550
right and then mention in your

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,660
introduction if you have a lot of times

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,220
you get to introduce yourself at

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,930
different networking events or just they

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,570
gives you a quick little time just to

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:51,860
say who you are we rather than just

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,800
going hi my name is Chris I work at day

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,330
driven labs

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,580
that means nothing to people right

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,920
instead you don't have to even give them

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,250
your job title say what you do at that

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,190
job right so instead of coming in I can

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,350
say I am Chris you know I'm co-owner of

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,820
beige overlaps that doesn't really tell

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,670
you anything but instead I can come in

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,520
and go hi I'm Chris I do

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,430
analytics and digital marketing for day

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,290
driven major elapsed so yes I didn't

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,700
give you my title but now you know

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,460
exactly what I do because I put the

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,280
service in there I told you what I do in

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,170
that introduction and a lot of places

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,360
don't allow you to say much more than

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,340
that if it's like one of those places in

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,870
a lot of introductions and it's not what

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,190
you can't get that out there same thing

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,710
to do that even though what's your name

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,270
tag if you know that asked me about but

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,740
you can write your title just write that

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:46,290
on there and then the other thing I like

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:50,400
to do and you'll see this at different

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,590
camps is where something unique we've

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,550
seen people who've done they've had

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,700
different color hair they've done really

00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,980
funky hats they they they have something

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,970
that makes them stand out that makes

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,310
people want to come up to have a

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,920
conversation one of the things I do is I

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:10,620
go to a lot of camps and I collect these

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,940
little guys they're the wahoos you see I

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,340
think there's a couple of them out here

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,560
you can find but a lot of camps make

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,380
these little whoppers and I've got one

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,730
from I got one from Japan on here I've

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,680
got one from I got ones from all

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,200
different work camps all over and I've

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,720
got about three times this in my

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,370
backpack or at home and so I have all

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,020
these different ones my wife actually

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,360
gone to the route that she actually has

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,820
like a triple lanyard and she swears all

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,580
these but I have back problems I'm not

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,400
gonna wear that much weight on my neck

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,630
right but it causes it it gets feel to

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,460
come up I can tell you already at this

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,750
camp there may be a few of you in this

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,610
room they actually have come up to me

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,190
and asked me about some of these that

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,720
are on my lanyard that's actually a

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,900
tactic that I use to get people to come

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,970
in here and talk with me because by that

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,620
you started that conversation with me I

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,210
didn't have to go and try and start that

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,370
conversation and it's an easy

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,140
conversation for me to have I'm like oh

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,630
yeah I got this one this is from work

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,940
camp Orlando and 2000

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,679
good thing and I can start kind of

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,230
talking about that and then it can

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,730
transition into you so you know what do

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,500
you do and then it turns into a

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:22,260
conversation and that's how he's got our

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:24,360
conversation started alright so this one

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,640
so it's a little creepy so I was like

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,789
not sure how to put it in here it sounds

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,270
really bad but it does work right

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:37,350
eavesdrop and I don't mean like right

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,240
this conversation is happening all

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,220
around you and so when you're in at an

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,840
event kind of keep your ears open and

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,309
see what what people are talking about

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,520
because every once in a while you

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,690
overhear people having a conversation

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,640
about something that you may actually

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,289
know and you may overhear them going

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,280
yeah I don't know how that works and

00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,669
I've actually heard like two people

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,190
going the ad I have no idea and if you

00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:01,140
feel make sure it's right let's walk in

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,760
on someone's conversation but you can go

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,140
actually I can help you with that I

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,870
actually know a little bit about that

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,419
and you can walk in and kind of get into

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,650
the conversation that's worked a lot and

00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,840
and it's one of the things that a

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,070
networking event it's okay

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,980
there are certain places maybe you

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,960
shouldn't eavesdrop on people but most

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,270
places like in the networking event it's

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,760
usually okay to kind of hear or it can

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,309
even be that you hear a conversation

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,140
happening over here you can listen and

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,280
kind of get an idea of what certain

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,440
people are talking about and then later

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,730
on go and find that person and have that

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
conversation with that person because

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,110
you know that was something that they

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,480
were having that talked about earlier

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,890
with somebody else and you can say hey I

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,059
want to go back to that person and have

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,159
a conversation so that's one I use as

00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:51,210
well to get things started and then the

00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,820
basic one just approach somebody they're

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,380
not gonna bite you at least I hope not I

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,799
haven't been doing event yet this one's

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,830
fit me it happens at this camp well

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,090
might be a little weird but I'm not

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,340
nobody's gonna bite your head off

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,840
nobody's gonna yell at you it's it's

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,980
natural for people to just come up and

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,450
talk at one of these events that's why

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,090
they call them networking events right

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,460
and and every event you go to even even

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,419
a work camp right this is a networking

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,640
everybody's here talking to each other

00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,260
learning from each other it's natural

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,039
for someone to just come up and talk to

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,100
you who doesn't know

00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,200
right so find a way to just go up have a

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,059
conversation with people and just start

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,169
talking with them right and just start

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,029
finding out you know we you know just

00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,769
just just just just start that that

00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,139
relationship building process right

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,269
because I think that's the key is with

00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:41,820
the conversation piece before you start

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:44,879
selling you want to just really build

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,389
that relationship and then that's when

00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:51,749
we kind of start selling so how do we do

00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:54,960
that right biggest way and this is the

00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:57,210
biggest thing necessay actually makes

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,059
the difference between ace a car sales

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,940
of car salesperson and anyone else right

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:06,090
you need to listen hear what they have

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,340
to say instead of talking to them and

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,419
telling them what you want them to do

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,249
because you remember you're there to

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,809
help right you're you're not there to

00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:14,549
just sell a product you're there to help

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,440
so you want to hear what their problem

00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:19,409
is hear hear what's going on with them

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,960
listen for like different key points you

00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:24,090
can use later that you might be able to

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,009
help them with and don't immediately

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,529
jump into trying to sell sell something

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:30,359
to them hear what they have asked more

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,649
questions to dive deeper into dig a

00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:36,330
little bit deeper into what they're

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:40,919
they're asking and then you want to

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,929
identify some pain points so this is

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,080
where when you're talking to them you're

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,789
gonna hear they're usually what I have

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,139
found you're talking to someone when

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:51,659
there's a pain point they go back to

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:53,879
that pain point two or three times they

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,919
keep they stay they pass it and they

00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:57,539
come back to it and so you'll start to

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,429
hear those if you listen long enough to

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,679
what they have to say you'll start to

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,279
really understand where they're having

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,080
issues this is kind of going back to you

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,999
know buying any product if you walk in

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,229
and you're looking to buy you know

00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,489
you're just you walk into a store you're

00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:12,509
looking to buy a soda and someone's

00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:14,909
trying to sell you a sandwich

00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:18,359
and I was here to buy a soda I'm not

00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:19,649
really sure I want that this is kind of

00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,929
where the pain points come you want to

00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:25,019
make sure that you can identify what

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:27,479
they're looking for first and then with

00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:30,119
that that's where you can then offer

00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:32,039
them a real solution and notice I didn't

00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,480
say a product here I said you want to

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,840
offer them a solution

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,240
and this is this is where we come in and

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,010
we say you know what based off your pain

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,190
points this is where you're having the

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,260
most issues that I can see this is what

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,450
I would tell you that you should do this

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,700
if I were you this is how I would fix

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,350
those problems and then you kind of go

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,480
through those and those can be your

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,450
products but you're presenting it in a

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,750
solutions type of form to them you're

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,059
not just coming straight off and saying

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,799
okay cool so your biggest problem is

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,399
that you just don't have time to get in

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,960
an update your website that's great

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,240
here I have a maintenance package you

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,190
should buy instead of doing that and go

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
you know tell them you know hey I

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,700
understand so you're telling me your

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,320
issues going into your website you're

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,600
having a lot you know you're not able to

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,539
get all the updates in there what if you

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,120
had a what if there was somebody who

00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:29,100
could do that for you what do you have

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,539
some you know is there somebody else you

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,279
know who go in and make those updates

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,289
for you or have you worked with anybody

00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,940
who can make this kind of updates and so

00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:39,809
that way it doesn't come off very salesy

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,549
you're showing them hey listen I have a

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,049
solution for you and I'm not trying to

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,700
sell you my product I'm just offering

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,440
you a solution there's tons of people

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,419
who can do this for you I just want to

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:56,010
say maybe you should look into maybe

00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:59,549
using a service okay yeah and then with

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:02,399
that you also want to set sell the value

00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:07,049
right so you need to focus on that value

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,100
of why they're trying to why they should

00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,720
because this is where you start

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,730
transition and talk a little bit about

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,889
your product right this is where you're

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,600
talking about your maintenance for and

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,100
the example we gave and you're talking

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
about your maintenance packages or

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,110
whatnot and so you want to give them the

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,320
value of why it makes more sense to pay

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,909
for somebody to do that for them and

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,190
this is where you can use things like

00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,470
ROI help them understand what their ROI

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,260
their return on investment can be for

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,750
using a service or using your product to

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,600
help them with this type of service or

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,610
with what you're working on

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,019
don't talk pricing though I think that's

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,190
going a little too far right then you

00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,130
just really want to just kind of just

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:50,519
talk about the value of using that

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,440
a good example is going back with the

00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:57,720
maintenance stuff I've had people tell

00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:00,029
me that well I could just you know I can

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,130
go in login up let update my own

00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,230
websites okay well that's great

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,240
are you updating them on a daily basis

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,679
I've had people tell me well I've got

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,639
multiple websites and why can't I just

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,679
update them there's I mean there's tools

00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:16,860
out there you can do that go to the pros

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,259
one right you can actually just they can

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,669
sign up for that and they can update all

00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,230
their something like well why why would

00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:24,059
I just use one of those tools I remember

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,570
we even use that tool to update our

00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,059
sites

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,970
why couldn't I use that tool to run all

00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,649
my updates and my thing is I come back

00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,379
and say well here's the difference yes

00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:36,240
you gotta log in daily and you got it

00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:38,460
you got to do that but what happens when

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,200
it breaks what happens when an update

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,120
doesn't take do you know how to

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,570
troubleshoot that have you worked on

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,580
that are you actually logging in on a

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,399
daily basis to do that or do you forget

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,860
and then realize you know four months

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,240
down the road and a big security

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,940
vulnerability comes out and posted on

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,379
CNN and you're like oh yeah I haven't

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,600
updated my site in four months I forgot

00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,250
to log in and do that you know are you

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,289
actually making sure all that happens

00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,240
because that's what our service does and

00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:08,279
our service has this value we come in

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,409
and we we have somebody who logs in

00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,059
daily and they they take care of you and

00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,710
they make sure all this is happening if

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,750
something it's not right they'll reach

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,309
out to you what you're doing is you're

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,559
selling the value of the product now

00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,970
you're saying yes you can do this on

00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,299
your own and there's tools to do this

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,759
and those tools will work that will help

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,009
you but what we're telling you is you're

00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,429
hiring not just a tool but you're hiring

00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:34,080
a person there's a value to using our

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,000
service and you can do this with any

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,649
product you know even if you're hosting

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,970
a hosting product or you are a website

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:44,340
developer this is where you can come in

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,649
and say you know look with our websites

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,480
we do this this and this and this is

00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:50,429
what makes us stand out from our

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,500
competitor and this is why there's value

00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,960
in working with us and this is the kind

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,510
of an return on your investment you can

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,320
see one thing is we do all web sites

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,460
that you build with us we've you know

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,220
I've been doing conversion rate

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,139
optimization a be testing analytics so

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,360
when your site comes up it's gonna have

00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:10,370
full-blown analytics in it it's gonna be

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,779
conversion rate optimized it's gonna be

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,909
built to best practices based off of

00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,480
lots of a/b tests that we have done over

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:19,070
many years and this is why I come to

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,779
them and say so here's the value you're

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,830
not just getting a website from us but

00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,110
you're getting a website it's gonna

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,309
increase your conversions so increase

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,080
your sales it's going to increase your

00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:30,080
leads and hopefully increase your

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,730
revenue and and so there's a value to

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,620
buying our service and I still haven't

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,080
at this point talk price I haven't even

00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,279
said what we charge because that's a

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,169
whole different discussion that we want

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,700
to have down the road I just want them

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:45,320
to at least be interested in working

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,889
with me and then yeah we're back to it

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,620
again

00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,730
it's time to listen again because once

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,929
you've talked about all this they're

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,720
gonna come back and then they're gonna

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:56,149
they're gonna restate they're gonna

00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,379
restate their issues and they're going

00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:59,179
to talk about what you just talked about

00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:01,370
and you may find out that some of the

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:02,990
stuff that you just offered isn't what

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,370
they actually wanted and this is where

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,279
you need to listen again because they're

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,240
gonna really help refine what they need

00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:11,179
the biggest thing I say when you get

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,799
into sales don't sell people something

00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,470
they do they don't want if you're gonna

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,419
sell somebody something they don't an

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,159
item they don't want they're not going

00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,470
to convert there they're going to run

00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,679
away instead hear what they have to say

00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:28,190
know what they want and come in with a I

00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,659
want to help you and in saying just tell

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,820
them you want to help them but actually

00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:33,409
have that as your actual attitude make

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,600
sure you're coming in to help people and

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,220
you're just there to take care of them

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,039
and make a little money along the way

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,330
but you're going to be there just to

00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,029
take care of them and I think that's the

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,799
biggest key that we found and it's about

00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:47,509
that relationship all of our clients

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,980
trust us we have a lot of clients

00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,350
they've actually told us you know what

00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,029
just tell us what we mean because we

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,700
know that you're not going to just throw

00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,350
things in there and we don't we've

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,080
actually had clients afford that we've

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,149
gone to them and said look this strategy

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,259
is not working we want to switch to this

00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,639
strategy and you're like well that means

00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,620
you're getting less money a month I'm

00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,970
like yes but I don't want you throwing

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,799
your money away on this thing that

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,200
doesn't work and it helped to build that

00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,340
trust that client stayed with us for a

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,679
very long time

00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,809
because they're still with us but they

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,029
stayed with us because they trusted us

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:20,990
they knew that hey we're looking out for

00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,210
them we're looking out for their bottom

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,860
dollar I tell people I'm gonna treat

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,570
your company as if it's my own company

00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,220
with the marketing I'm not gonna just

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,499
waste your money and if you build that

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,899
trust in that relationship and you can

00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:34,159
do that through these conversations

00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,360
they're going to trust you a whole lot

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,529
more and they're gonna want to do

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,049
business with you all right so then get

00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:45,169
their contact info and I don't mean hand

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:47,960
them your business card a lot of people

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:50,600
will ask hey do you have a business card

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,639
or you have any uh any way I can contact

00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,289
you and they'll say well just give me

00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,899
they'll say I don't have any business

00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:59,509
cards printed up or I don't have money

00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:01,940
can you scan your business card if they

00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:03,350
tell you that see if you can write down

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,809
so you can get their information to

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,569
write that write it down this is one of

00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:11,060
those biggest things that I like to

00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:12,440
really focus on because what we have

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,419
found is if you hand a business card to

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,579
somebody the likelihood in there we're

00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,409
going to call you is very low because

00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,970
they're gonna forget about it and go to

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,919
the wash they're gonna forget about you

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,929
know who you were instead if you get

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,129
their card you go back and you can

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,429
follow up with them which we'll talk

00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:30,710
about in a little bit and then the other

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,230
thing I do so they'll just collect their

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,119
contact info I take notes on them on

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,040
right onto your business card so I'll

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,440
carry a pen and I'll turn around and

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,730
after either while I'm talking to them

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,780
but usually it's right after I talk to

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,450
them when I turn around I'm talking

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,159
about that little break you take between

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,589
going from person to person I'll turn

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,240
around and write a couple key words down

00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,310
that I know is gonna help me later that

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,349
night when I go put them into my CRM

00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,659
which we'll talk about as well it's

00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:58,010
gonna help me put some notes in so that

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,290
when I actually have that call or I

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,619
follow up with that person I'm not just

00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,720
going hi I don't really remember who you

00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:07,910
are but I met you at this last event at

00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,380
this one event you've got to remember

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,240
you may not be talking these people

00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,680
again for a month later you're not gonna

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,329
remember everybody as much as you think

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,490
you are you're not gonna remember every

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:18,680
detail about them but if you do remember

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,119
the stuff that's really important put it

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,010
down so I always put down kind of what

00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,450
they're looking for so I don't call them

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,760
and start selling them a website when

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,210
they were looking for in those package I

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,390
don't start selling there

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,790
you know SEO when they were asking for

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,130
PPC I made sure that I write down what

00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:38,970
they were looking for and so that way I

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,849
can come back and go hey we talked to

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,250
about a month ago about PPC and I'll be

00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,359
like oh yeah okay yeah that's right I've

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,290
actually had enough whole people in

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,640
there like I don't remember when I

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,150
talked to you about and then I have to

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,760
remind them so always take notes and I

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,410
take them right onto the card if you

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,700
want to have a notebook you can actually

00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,349
write their name and take the

00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,640
information down to a notebook it's

00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:02,430
however you want to do it that's easiest

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,900
for you like I said for me I was right

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,430
all right on to the card and then that

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,440
they don't have that I write down their

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,420
information so I have it for later to

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,369
contact them I usually ask for just

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,250
their name email address and phone

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:18,230
number and usually then I can take my

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:20,460
own notes from that so speaking of that

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:27,150
and then want to talk about following up

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:29,400
right this is a big step with any of

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,369
those with any leads you need to make

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,589
sure that you do follow up and I'm not

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,299
talking about justinian email and this

00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:38,940
is where the introvert side of me comes

00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:41,400
out right for me I like to set an email

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,589
and go oh they didn't reply all right

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,280
whatever right and walk away

00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:48,960
I found that doesn't work I found

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,030
sometimes takes multiple emails they

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,240
lose your email or whatever they forget

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,760
to reply but also make calls and I mean

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,549
that pithre all make phone calls until

00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,380
you connect with them and don't don't

00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:02,760
stop and the reason I say phone calls is

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,359
if you initially talked to this person

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,950
in person so having a conversation with

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,130
them on the phone there's gonna be a lot

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,349
easier than just a lot more formal than

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,540
just sitting an email to them so that's

00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:16,710
one of the things I'm like you you can

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,559
send an email now if you send an email

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,390
they reply right away then you can go

00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,250
that route they may be someone who likes

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,010
to email back and forth but make sure

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,420
you try to make some calls as well to

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:31,680
try and follow up and do your best to

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:35,849
try and get hold of them if you can if

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,569
you don't follow yeah so like with the

00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:38,670
following up

00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:40,410
I don't immediately jump in to try and

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,040
sell it as well that's where I try to

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,410
build

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,570
relationship I don't jump in in my first

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,840
initial email to them and say hey you

00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:51,030
were at this camp here's my pricing

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,640
let's let's talk I still come back to

00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,230
the you know hey we talked about someone

00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,210
you're you know we mentioned some of

00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,700
their pain points and say and we talked

00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:02,780
about how we could use this particular

00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,310
service PPC we can use PPC to help you

00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,770
you know build your business and get

00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:10,410
past that and you know kind of reach out

00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,990
to them more as hey I still just want to

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,880
help you and so you can get that call in

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:18,840
that conversation going so that you then

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,110
move on to actually you know presenting

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,640
your pricing presenting your proposal to

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,150
them which will actually talk about some

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,580
proposal tools here in a minute as well

00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:32,100
and then don't walk away from Anil and

00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:36,390
this is one it is more of a recent

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:38,720
lesson for me we actually just were

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,630
fortunate enough to be able to hire a

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,240
business development guy to do all of

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,250
our sales for us so once we get a lead

00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,410
we give him over to him he goes ahead

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,390
and get has those initial conversations

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,320
relationship building and it gets us on

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:57,960
the line for the final piece to talk to

00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,330
them and put together a proposal one of

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,650
the things I learned from him was the

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,900
walking away from Anil

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,670
what we often did is when someone said

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,160
no or they said I'm not interested at

00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:11,330
this time or anything like that we took

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,090
it as a rejection and we said oh well

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,740
throw it out moved on and we recently

00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,620
had this with a very large client who

00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:23,010
was looking for PPC for a bunch of

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:25,230
different stores nationwide and they

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,640
came back and they said we had a meeting

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,170
set up their head we're trying to have a

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,700
meeting with their headquarters we were

00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,680
really excited about it was a good

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,870
opportunity and then they came back and

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,570
just said that they didn't want to focus

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,620
right now on brand awareness and they

00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,350
didn't want to spend money on brand

00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,060
awareness well I was like wow that

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,880
stinks I was like well we lost that lead

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,140
and maybe they'll call us back one day I

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,160
don't know

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,780
and I sales like I said I'm not done and

00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,640
he turns around he calls them back up

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,480
and he and he actually offered him he

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,410
says I just

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,760
Sanna you're not looking for brand

00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,300
awareness but we would love to still

00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:03,210
educate you on how PPC just educate you

00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,890
on how PPC can help you in other areas

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,900
beyond brand awareness and then that way

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,670
you can all and and still present you

00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,070
some numbers so you can have those

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,780
numbers ready for when you are ready to

00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,060
make the decision and then turn around

00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,290
said can we still set a meeting and we

00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,210
end up getting a meeting with the top

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:20,070
executives when we weren't speaking with

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,540
the top executive at that time we

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,180
actually have a meeting actually Monday

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,550
morning with the top executives to go

00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,770
over and present all this information to

00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,000
them even though they said they weren't

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,480
interested and this is gonna allow us

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,980
another opportunity to still try and

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,510
sell them with a need because now we

00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,780
understand and that's that part of

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,310
listening we understand they don't they

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,310
don't want the brand recognition they

00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,720
want to get people into the stores with

00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,270
their campaigns so that's gonna be our

00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,920
focus of our entire presentation is not

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,960
just let's build your brands that people

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,550
know who you are but we know when we

00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,010
walk in there we're gonna go ahead and

00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,440
sell the idea of how do we get people to

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,720
show up at their store and so that just

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,550
changes the way I do my PPC strategy I'm

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,770
gonna pull out any kind of brand pieces

00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,520
and just focus on the pieces that

00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:09,840
generate the direct conversions and so I

00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,510
thought that was really interesting and

00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,770
and so from that to kind of a way you're

00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:19,260
gonna offer education so yes oh sorry

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,230
PPC is paid pay-per-click so Google Ads

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:27,240
Facebook Ads any kind of advertising

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:30,240
they click on to get to your site so you

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,090
can offer education that's that's the

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,410
biggest way to do it so when they say no

00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,630
say well that's awesome

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,030
well can we still at least educate you

00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,470
on it because that allows them to learn

00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,300
a little bit more about it sometimes

00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,670
people say no because they're scared and

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,200
they don't know what it is and so

00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,440
educating them on it may make them a

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,030
little bit more opened up to it you can

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,110
go the route of talking to somebody else

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,450
be careful with this because if you if

00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,070
they know that you know you've or they

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,740
assigned someone to talk and you go over

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,330
their head it could turn out bad but if

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,220
you're talking to one person and you

00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,160
know somebody else there maybe talk to

00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,809
them as well right

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,369
ask them what a better time is right

00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:16,230
this is really for me this is this works

00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,960
out because we get a lot of people who

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,780
just say yeah it's just not the time so

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,280
when I asked him what's a better time it

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,220
kind of puts them on a commitment to set

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,420
a time they're like well I mean it's I

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,349
mean it's the summer the kids are asked

00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,000
can we set something forward maybe

00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,099
September and you're coming back in

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,599
September and so that least now gets you

00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,670
a reason when you call back in September

00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,349
and say hey I'm giving a call back you

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,059
asked me to call you back in September

00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,880
and talk to you about this and so that

00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:47,250
kind of helps kind of forces them to

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,569
give you a timeline so you're not overly

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,420
annoying because if they don't tell you

00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:52,829
what a better time is you don't want to

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,750
call them in a month and it's actually a

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,690
worse time than just say stop calling me

00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,819
so it's a great way to set a future time

00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,589
and then in your CRM which key and we'll

00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,530
talk about that in a second that's gonna

00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:07,740
allow you to put a note to make sure you

00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,329
do reach back out to them content

00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,859
contact them back at a later time I

00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,760
think that's a duplicate of what I just

00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:14,700
said

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,589
and then add them to a drip campaign so

00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,200
what we actually will do sometimes is

00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:20,700
we'll take certain clients that will put

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,500
them in our nurturing campaign which is

00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,940
where every once in a while we'll send

00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,950
out a couple marketing tips and

00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,020
everything through email to them it's a

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,359
very simple we actually have it above

00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,890
the fold says unsubscribe so if they

00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,190
don't want those they can get out of

00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,799
there

00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:37,260
make sure that's the key do not overly

00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:38,579
annoy them right but we have it we're

00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,670
just every couple of weeks that still

00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,079
drop something over to them it just

00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,750
talks to them and tells them a little

00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,250
bit about some marketing stuff and ways

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,049
they can digitally market their business

00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,270
and that way they still keep remembering

00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:53,160
who we are and they don't forget who we

00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,150
are down the road so that if they do end

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,529
up needing something down the road

00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:01,619
hopefully they remember who we are and

00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:07,829
then simply you may not be the person

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:11,539
for them in that case you still want to

00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:14,190
try to build that relationship you know

00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,990
don't push a product on them

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,140
that they don't mean so if you look at

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,609
them and go really I don't have anything

00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,570
that's going to help what you need I had

00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:24,480
a guy who

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,700
Ashley thought he needed digital

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,030
marketing but when he talked to him he

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,820
wanted us to completely rebuild he had a

00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:34,380
warehouse solution and he needed some

00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,150
kind of I ain't forget what the name of

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,520
the system the type of system is but it

00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,970
was a very complex software system to

00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,190
track and it plugged in literally to the

00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,530
manufacturing machines in the warehouse

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,050
to track the performance of the machines

00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,720
on I'm like this is software development

00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,840
this isn't web development this is not

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,210
what we do and rather than try to push

00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,710
one of our products on him I made sure

00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,690
he understood what kind of work did we

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,730
did and then I actually gave him a

00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,200
couple references of people I knew who

00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,790
were in a software development business

00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,110
and said these people might be able to

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,000
help you with what you're looking for

00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:12,060
and then sent him on his way and by

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,740
doing that the guy did not the guy has

00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,270
stayed in touch he has reached out to me

00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,220
to four and had us do a couple small

00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,050
things for him because we didn't try to

00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,690
push products on him at the time that he

00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,700
meet that he didn't need because his his

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,920
pain point at that time was his soft

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:29,240
custom software solution that we

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:34,950
couldn't put we couldn't do for him and

00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:37,950
then the sales tools right this isn't a

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,270
digital one this is still print and a

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,040
lot of people go but you're all about

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,890
digital why would you say this business

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,510
cards business cards are still still a

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,200
big thing I carry them with me

00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,930
everywhere I go

00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,640
sometimes I always kind of forget as

00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:54,030
well but usually they're in my pocket

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,770
I'm ready to hand them out these are

00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:59,310
great to have to hand out to people at

00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:02,490
all times it you know most of them are

00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:04,230
gonna probably throw them away but you

00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,980
will get a few people who do contact you

00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,690
from them still

00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,190
so having knows because you can then

00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,600
quickly hand them out because the other

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,060
thing I find it networking events and

00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,620
fans like this is somebody's on their

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,850
way to something else they got to run to

00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,530
something and so they run up so you

00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,330
didn't say hey I don't have time to talk

00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,370
do you have a business card you can

00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,130
throw me real quick they run off with

00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:25,230
your business card and you have no idea

00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,190
what they even wanted but they run off

00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,640
your business card and they usually

00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,860
contact you a little bit later so make

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,230
sure you always have that on you and you

00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,750
have something you know printed up that

00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,220
has your information on

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,800
and then we're going to talk about crms

00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,210
right so the biggest thing you want to

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,770
do is you want to track everything with

00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:49,050
a CRM this is extremely important to log

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,780
all notes all information on every

00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,940
single lead that you have while you

00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,790
think that your brain is a sealed trap

00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,930
you will forget things especially as you

00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,300
get older I'm starting to learn that

00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:03,150
happens a lot

00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:07,080
you will so what we do is we we actually

00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:08,670
use doho CRM I they do have a free

00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,170
version and then they have a paid

00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,520
version I think all of these have I

00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,350
don't know if closed I oh I don't think

00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,870
closed i/o has a free version but all

00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,010
their other ones have a free version I

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,420
mean they have paid upgrades and stuff

00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,310
like that

00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,870
we use these to track everything with

00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,700
everybody and so when I talked about

00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:29,340
earlier you writin down the notes on

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,280
those cards get back to your hotel room

00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,080
or go back home or wherever when you get

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,580
back make sure that whenever you

00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,800
schedule any kind of networking event

00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,650
that you schedule time when you get back

00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,140
home to sit down for 20-30 minutes and

00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,940
log all of these people into your CRM

00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,430
because you have fresh knowledge of

00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,040
talking to them and so those little

00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,930
keywords you put on that card you will

00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,850
hopefully still be able to remember what

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,560
you just had a conversation with them

00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:57,360
about and you can put that in the notes

00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,890
and fill out the whole notes field

00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,170
because I've gone to great calls before

00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:03,360
and having all of those notes from that

00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,830
initial conversation is amazing and

00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,920
having every single note from every

00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:11,220
single other call is great and another

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,470
cool thing is our system actually

00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,510
automatically tracks emails and most of

00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,340
them you can actually have a BCC line

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,200
that you can put in there and so all

00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,890
emails you send with that client are

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,500
tracked our system actually does the

00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:28,380
Zoho CRM system integrates with our

00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,320
Gmail I think as well I don't know about

00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,810
bit tricks but it actually pulls not

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,760
every email that I sent every email that

00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,800
anybody in our organization has sent and

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,600
I can see every email everybody in our

00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,700
organization has sent back and forth to

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,840
that client so I can also see if

00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,750
somebody else is having a conversation

00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,940
with him at the same time be like okay

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,660
well you know Sandy's already handling

00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,359
this so

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,220
I'm not gonna bother or I can pick up

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,049
where she left off and so it's nice to

00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:58,170
know other conversations that were had

00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:59,369
and what they talked about so I'm just

00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,700
make sure all those are getting logged

00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:04,920
into a CRM and these are these are some

00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,020
of the ones I recommend that are they

00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,460
all have free versions I said I don't

00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,530
know about close to Iowa has a free

00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,589
version but these are all really good

00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:17,609
tools with these sign up for the trials

00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:19,410
well they're free start sign up play

00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:21,510
around with them see if they do what you

00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,470
need and if they don't move on to the

00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,420
next one

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,339
these four tools are a little bit

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,910
different and you want to find the best

00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,910
one for you

00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:35,309
and then the last tool I want to talk

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,390
about is running good proposals

00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,039
so once you've had all these

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,770
conversations you want to send them

00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:45,119
everything written now in a nice scope

00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:46,950
of work with a price on it there's

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,980
couple really great tools to do this we

00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:52,619
use for post fi panda Docs is like

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,230
almost an exact copy or maybe propose if

00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,420
I copied panda Docs they're both very

00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,420
similar the way they work they have a

00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,000
sign they have abilities for templates

00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,520
and all that Google Docs is a little bit

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,589
is a free method these other ones do not

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,619
have a free version and Docs proposed if

00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:13,020
I and I don't think Quiller does either

00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:15,539
Google Docs is a free version but you

00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:18,119
will need an e sine component and

00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:21,839
usually I think there's hello sine is

00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,069
one that's out there DocuSign so there's

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,529
a couple of those you can look up as

00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:27,480
well and those allow you to do ecig

00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:31,020
matures to get them to sign off on a

00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,690
quote but you can do those as well

00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,549
through Google Docs if you want for a

00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,319
cheaper option send everything as a PDF

00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:40,440
don't ever send it as a document that

00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:43,349
they can edit send it over as a PDF and

00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,880
have the digital signatures on it so

00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:46,710
that you can have a copy and you can

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,210
make it very easy for them to sign the

00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,089
key is to make it so they can accept the

00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:53,819
proposal as as easily as possible and

00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,930
don't make a lot of steps to it what we

00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:57,390
often do this will send over to a

00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,849
proposal we'll wait a couple days if

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:01,829
they haven't we actually the president

00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,310
proposed if I I can actually see and

00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,440
same with

00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,060
Oh Docs you can actually see exactly

00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,920
what they've read and how much time

00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,810
they've spent on individual pages within

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,650
the proposal which is kind of cool so

00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,070
you can see how many times they've

00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,510
opened it where they're getting stuck

00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,490
sadly most of the people that we send

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,020
proposals to skip over the scope of work

00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,080
go straight to the price section and

00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:24,420
then go down to the contract section

00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,890
which is really bad because that means

00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,900
it didn't actually look at the scope of

00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:29,940
work so they're gonna maybe be a client

00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,990
later it says oh I didn't know that

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,280
wasn't in scope of work so you can see

00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,010
and sometimes know where to have a

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,830
conversation with them from that as well

00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:42,470
but yeah I would I would say you want to

00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,220
make sure your proposals well-written

00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:49,830
our proposals are about normally about

00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:52,020
sixteen pages long and they include

00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:54,750
information about our team has our

00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,130
contract in it and it also has the

00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,800
pricing in the scope of work

00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,200
well-defined which is a whole different

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,810
talk but you want to make sure that

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,130
that's all defined in that proposal so

00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,320
that they can see it don't just email

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,570
them over you know oh that's gonna cost

00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,040
five grand to build that and that's all

00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:14,340
you send them make sure everything is

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,590
detailed out and looks professional even

00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:21,600
as a freelancer it's gonna really help

00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:24,180
you close those deals so for this talk

00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,580
that's all I have if you have any

00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:28,590
questions you can email me

00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,650
there's our website it's got a lot of

00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:40,460
blog articles related to this on it and

00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:40,460
now we're gonna take questions now yes

00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:55,500
oh yeah no I haven't I haven't read that

00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:59,000
book now what's the book called wind

00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:04,470
without pitching who's it by layer ends

00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:09,150
okay so I haven't read it it sounds like

00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:13,269
a good book so yeah yeah author pick it

00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:17,319
up and read it yes sir

00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:24,349
- a wedge yes yes I'll be there

00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:26,150
huh IVA I've scared the whole time I'm

00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:43,670
in a camp but I go - enough of them left

00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:49,940
I figured it out yes ma'am he's he's the

00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:52,690
extrovert that yes awesome

00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,690
in the back first

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,160
I think more beyond resources is just

00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,010
more just kind of what I like to do is I

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,610
did so the reason I give talks I've

00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:19,520
given now probably over 50 different

00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:21,440
talks at different camps and stuff the

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,210
reason I started giving talks is because

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,100
it scared me to death

00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,840
it still makes me nervous like how many

00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,790
of you tell I'm sweating a little bit it

00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,010
still makes me nervous getting up in

00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:33,980
front of a big group of people even even

00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,230
now but nothing like I mean when I first

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,380
did it I was shivering I had to hold on

00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:41,510
to the podium when I gave my first talk

00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,860
and I did it because it scared me and I

00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,570
think that's really the thing is just

00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,090
find it but make sure you do it on

00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:48,350
something that you absolutely love and

00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,490
you're passionate about because if you

00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,650
try to do it on something that you don't

00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:54,080
know that you just you read something

00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:56,270
else and you're trying to copy their

00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,950
presentation or copy what they did

00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:59,600
you're gonna mess up but if you do it on

00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,430
something that you that you know and

00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,780
love and you're passionate about it's

00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,520
something that you're gonna be able cuz

00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,250
it's its second nature to you you're

00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,660
gonna go back to it you know and then

00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:12,560
there's different things you know look

00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,030
over the heads if you want you know I it

00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,220
took me a while to get to the point now

00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,540
I actually you know have points I

00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,430
actually have points set in this room

00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:22,190
right now when I was talking of you know

00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:24,200
people I keep looking around too so I

00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:26,570
keep looking around but when I first

00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,190
started I couldn't look at faces if I

00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,720
looked at faces I would freeze up and I

00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,460
wouldn't know what to do so I would just

00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,980
kind of like look like this it never

00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,630
never actually look anybody in the eye

00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,780
in the room so that's kind of my

00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:41,540
suggestion it's just really just fine to

00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,610
place a word camps are amazing maybe if

00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:47,630
a word camps too big your local meetup

00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:48,710
start there and just find something to

00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,020
get up in front of people and just talk

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:53,060
about and I think that it helps you

00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,060
along the way get a little bit easier

00:55:53,060 --> 00:56:01,030
yeah it's a little easier to to sell the

00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,030
things we had a question over here

00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,369
so I bring them up pretty much right

00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:15,260
away I come back and I kind of give him

00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:18,079
a submarine because a lot of times I

00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,940
find you know when you meet them in a

00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,309
networking event they're like four

00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:26,510
drinks and they're gonna tell you

00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:28,099
everything and and so I bring back up

00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,480
the pain points their business they go

00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:32,450
into pain points of other things that's

00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,300
we're not covering that up but but you

00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:37,099
know I go into those like right away and

00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,800
I kind of give him a recap of what we

00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:42,500

00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,390

00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,930
they're receptive because they're at a

00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,570
networking event that's what they're

00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:04,090

00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:06,610

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,950
chair and sit down at their table that's

00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,510
gonna get a little weird

00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,280
and they may tell you to leave at that

00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,480
