the wonderful thing about word camp

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,590
right because we have looked at other

met the CEO that was pretty cool so did

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,990
I mention we mentioned meet people from

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,880
all over the world so remember I

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,660
mentioned to you carol Olinger from

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,750
Germany from the German Eiffel she used

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,270
to be the community manager of Plesk she

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,610
just recently retired so people who know

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,100
her in the working camp community do

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:02,270
follow her still she is at wordcamp

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:06,740
europe I think this weekend and her and

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:10,970
her dog have their own who I'm

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,800
working my way that way and in this

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,140
particular one this is actually in

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,690
memory of I met a wonderful lady from

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:23,210
Nigeria this is Catherine egg Walley

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,140
she was a five-time best seller on

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,720
Amazon and she was a national bestseller

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,550
she actually came to Jacksonville and we

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,690
had the opportunity to drive her

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,550
and we became really good friends

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,970
unfortunately we did lose her this year

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,139
so this is in memory of her I struggled

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,949
with whether or not to put this in here

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,479
but she loved the community and she knew

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,819
about this you know before she passed

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,330
she was so excited about it so we keep

00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,490
her in there for for her here in the

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,620
middle that's part of campus so if

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,880
you're into the Latin community she is a

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,979
speaker she's also a celebrity Lindsey

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,620
is one of the wonderful people in work

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,789
camps San Jose these are just things

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,409
that you get to do with the after

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,569
parties you get to meet people so you

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,460
know here we get to talk but at the

00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,500
after party you actually get to sit and

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,710
really get to know people and and

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,110
communicate with them so again I'm going

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,630
back free to nearly free information for

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,400

to what we're going to call sickbay

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,900
right so it's a happiness bar but if you

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,490
have a problem with your computer or

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,590
your website someone is going to sit

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,060
with you and not charge you and say hey

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,740
yeah this is what you can do and you can

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,139
do the other thing that's like that's a

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,240
great thing

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,740
WordPress TV so if you missed the other

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,650
talks being here

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,849
they'll be uploaded to WordPress TV so

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,009
you didn't really miss anything you can

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:58,099
actually watch them on there and then

00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:01,819
there's hundreds if not more talks on

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:06,319
there plus the more often you go the

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,849
more you learn but there's more yay so

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,770
you're going to be one of the first to

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,569
narrow so the more you go to work camps

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,280
the more you're gonna know I didn't know

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,380
about Gutenberg and all of that I was

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,960
doing WordPress I learned that in a work

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,479
camp someone underneath and in fact did

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,639
a talk on Gutenberg and it was like oh

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,840
so we were the first ones to know this

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,370
is what's coming and this is what's

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,069
gonna come down the line I'm like oh

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,880
that was pretty neat inspiration is

00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:34,250
everywhere so you're gonna go online and

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,510
the hashtag is and we'll go over that -

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,130
hashtag WC AVL and follow all the other

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,469
people who are attacked you know um

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,380
tweeting and sending putting things on

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,790
Instagram volunteering

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,500
I actually volunteered this morning

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,820
that's my favorite thing to do is go to

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,100
the work camps and Roland's here so and

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,420
it can build confidence this someone

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,990
tweeted this out when we went to work

00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,030
camp

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,130
Fillie and they were saying I learned so

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,990
much I feel like an expert so I had to

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,550
put this little tweet in there so it

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,220
says long when did you become an expert

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:11,450
in Google Analytics and then it says

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,770
last night okay

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,880
so you get it you already know why

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,850
you're here you already know why you

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,560
paid your money so what are you gonna do

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,440
while you're here so the very first

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,510
thing I say is visit the sponsors so I

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,890
don't get paid by anyone I'm not this is

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,020
and I'm not plugging any particular

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,620
sponsor these are the sponsors that are

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,260
actually here blue house these are not

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,720
the guys that are here but Micah and

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,660
William are here today I went and went

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,490
by to see what their names are sometimes

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,870
they're just really cool people but more

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,120
importantly first of all this couldn't

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,550
happen without sponsors and secondly

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,950
they may have information that might

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,080
actually help your business just sit

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,790
down listen to them you know and they

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,500
may actually help your even your

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:59,000
personal website or what you're working

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:03,440
on so these are more sponsors here this

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,360
is a actually made Jonathan and Mickey

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,200
trivet they're both here so you can

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,000
visit them at no no's okay so this is

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,400
the interactive part this is where we're

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,750
gonna actually stop like I didn't come

00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,870

was really cool I want to remember that

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:16,250
you could just quote it say great talk

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,420
by Chris Lima and then quote it and then

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:28,510
you can put it on Twitter so remember

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:39,050

although they did enjoy it

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:04,370
this was actually a recommendation from

00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:06,890
another speaker take a cool picture and

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,300

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,240
a chance to walk around anyone took

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,400
pictures of the mountains great take a

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,040
picture of the mountains and say hey I'm

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,070
in work camp Asheville and I'm hashtag

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,660
WC AVL here's you know a beautiful

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,570
picture of the mountains let me say we

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,060
come from Florida so the whole way here

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,060
was kind of flat flat flat and in South

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,790
Carolina was pretty and then we get up

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,740
and then it was like okay exit one and

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,660
just a little bit up there was the

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,250
mountain it was like oh yeah North

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,020
Carolina delivered on some mountains

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:43,220
that was beautiful okay so since we

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:49,190
haven't had a chance you could take a

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,810
selfie right now and share it and you

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,550
can also share a video of your

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,170
experience so videos are really cool you

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,200
could just grab your phone kind of talk

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,570
and chat to yourself and it's fine I

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,280
won't feel you know just some kind of

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:05,470
way if you're looking at yourself taking

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,470
pictures I'm gonna feel like okay great

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,940
anybody post

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:18,350
you ready posted

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,000
don't forget hashtag WC AVL so if you

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,010
don't know about hashtags and the @

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,700
symbol so if you just do the @ symbol at

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,800
WordCamp

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,160
Asheville that will only go to Asheville

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,080
but if you do the hashtag WC AVL

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
everyone will be able to see what you're

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,770
posting who's ever following that

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,720
hashtag and it throughout the day you

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,830
might have an aha moment now let me tell

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,970
you this is one of the tricks that

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,980
you're going to learn what you're

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,350
learning is that you may not remember

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,850
that aha moment when you get home there

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,280
may be something great that someone said

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,280
but if you post it you'll remember it

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,260
okay

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,709
so um we're gonna talk with other

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,750
campers and this is part of this

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,760
interactive thing so what we're going to

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,240
do is because part of this is going to

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,209
go on WordCamp TV we're gonna take about

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,720
six or seven minutes and we are going to

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:22,490
speak to each other because this is the

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,120
most important part of being in a word

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,970
camp is networking but that's hard I

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,010
will tell you when I first started I

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:33,529
didn't and I may be soon there may be

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,060
friendly but I'm not that friendly so

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,800
when I started I would sit in the

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:42,320
happiness bar I kind of just sit and

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,029
listen and kind of honestly he's draw on

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
conversations cuz most of it was about

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,420
you know computers and stuff and people

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,269
would be talking tech or whatever and

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,200
you know smile and just and before you

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,089
know it someone starts a conversation

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,320
with you and you start talking with them

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,910
so if you're a little on the shy side

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,040
that's one way to do it

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,140
but we're actually gonna take a minute

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,240
or a few minutes to do this now what I

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,570
am gonna ask is that I could if I can

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,300
get some people who would be willing to

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,010
volunteer to just speak while other

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,740
people are speaking to each other so

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,810
that when they're doing the word camp TV

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,940
is not just dead space for people just

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,279
murmuring well you can actually come up

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,870
here and share your business and who you

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,010
are and what it is that you're doing

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:27,709
okay so if I can get five volunteers or

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,920
so okay so we are actually going to stop

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:35,870
at this point and we're gonna talk to

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:42,020

speaks on business and how to really get

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,500
yourself together and for me that was so

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,750
important because the very most

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,690
important thing that she talked about

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,690
was you're not selling anything you're

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,630
actually offering a service that's gonna

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,730
help someone and I was so it was so hard

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,040
for me to charge for what I was doing

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,290
that was so difficult but when she said

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,620
that I was like that's it that was my

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,240

be taking a lot of notes throughout the

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,780
entire time that you're here so how do

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,800
you build a starship just like you eat

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:18,100
an elephant one part at a time that's a

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,020
little corny make sure that you get

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,270
speaker slides on most of the speakers

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,860
will offer slides afterwards they'll let

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,380
you know here's the link you can get the

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,750
slides alright um they'll post it out on

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,160
Twitter some speakers only have their

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,320
slides for a short period of time

00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,380
grab them while they have them otherwise

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,970
you're gonna miss out on that highlight

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,610
the most important information in your

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,590
notes

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,450
so if you're taking notes today or

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,150
you're taking notes you know what right

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,880
now number one make sure you get the

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,830
full name of your speaker number two

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,380
make sure you get the correct name of

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:54,260
the talk because when you're looking for

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,090
it on WordPress TV if you don't have

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,040
that information it's gonna be very hard

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,850
to find them it does not always come up

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,870
as what the word camp is so you want to

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,610
make sure you have the right name for

00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:08,450
the talk and the right name for the

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,710
speaker decide right now how you want to

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,450
use the information that you're

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,740
gathering are you using it for your

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,380
business are you using it for your

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,220
website so that as you're writing what I

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:21,380
do when I'm writing my notes is I make

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,210
like sections and then I'll highlight

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,330
that section whether it would be like

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,950
with a big box around it if someone says

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,140
something important I have a highlighter

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,390
in my bag I write it down and then I

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,180
highlight it so that when I'm going back

00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,190
I can go oh yeah I wanted to remember

00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,900
that because otherwise it becomes just a

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,820
blur of words and you're not gonna

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,220
remember oh that was important that

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:47,720
wasn't so send out emails if you met

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,460
people and you said oh yeah I'm gonna

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:54,860
email you email them I'm gonna follow up

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,330
with you follow up because if you really

00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,520
want to keep that contact you want to do

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,110
that right away cuz three weeks four

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,630
weeks from now which I don't have to

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,460
admit I can be bad that way they're not

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,250
gonna remember so unless you're like

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,590
extra flamboyant and I can say I was the

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,220
girl in the Star Trek uniform you're not

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:16,460
gonna remember who I was right follow up

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,400
with your leads and connections and put

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,320
contacts wit notes in your phone so I

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,910
tell people if you get a business card

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,210
rather than having just a pile of

00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:29,060
business cards in your bag take a

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,210
picture of it I I'm a I'm an Android

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:35,000
girl so I use Google keep but I think

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,550
iPhone has like Evernote or something

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,050
take a picture of it and then underneath

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:43,820
it make a note oh I'm in April in

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,530
Jacksonville she talks about this I

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,710
remember she said this so then when I

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:51,110
see her again I can put the face with

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,510
the card and the whole thing comes

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,980
I'm gonna tell you I forget people

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,659
constantly this is the only place where

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,350
I actually go and I remember people's

00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,360
names

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,100
I remember what they do I remember where

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
I met them I'm like this must be my

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,460
people because otherwise I don't

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,460
remember anything

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:12,350
another thing is if you keep notes I

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,029
just keep a I used to you know I'm old

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,380
school so these phones are new for me

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:17,870
but I would take the business card and

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:25,639
tape it to my notebook and then just jot

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:28,730
down notes underneath so so these are

00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:33,100
other things that you can do invite your

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:36,799
new contacts to like you and follow you

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,289
make sure that you reciprocate right so

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,669
don't say hey follow me on Twitter and

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:41,960
then you don't follow back you know I

00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:45,080
mean like if you want people to follow

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,580
you you want to follow them whatever it

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,860
is if you know if you want them to check

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,409
out your website check out their website

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,389
it only takes a minute you know to just

00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:55,070
say hey I'll follow and later on if you

00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:58,450
feel like okay you know we're not

00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:01,580
connecting you can always change that

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:05,120
consider collaborating in the future so

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:08,269
I do websites for startups and that's

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,549
all I do I do not do big websites that's

00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:14,320
not what I do is for people who are on a

00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:17,840
budget you know any developers in here

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,039
yeah okay so um so you know some most of

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,690
them won't take it under a certain

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,039
amount I'm usually the one that's like

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,370
okay I'll take those only because I'm

00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:28,549
only doing simpler super simple so I

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,769
don't manage websites and those kinds of

00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,570
things so I find I meet people when they

00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:34,100
go why management website it's great I'm

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,320
gonna take your car so that next time I

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,350
have a client that needs management I'll

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,440
give it to you I don't do that so this

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,909
is a great way to delegate you know if

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,470
you have too much on your plate there's

00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:48,470
plenty of people who do what you don't

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,659
do or as you grow who do the things you

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,399
don't want to do later and you can say

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:56,590
okay I remember connecting with

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,590
such-and-such let me give them that

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:04,909
local what WordPress meetups are also a

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:10,009
great way to a meet other people but

00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:13,729

00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:15,499

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,019
have information she doesn't have and

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,299

00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:56,570
that I'm gonna get from your talk that I

00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:59,119

at a meet-up the groups are much smaller

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,710

know people come from all over the

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,850
country but like I said sometimes we

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,680

they can come from wherever so that's

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,060
that's wonderful but if you're in your

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:31,280
local area and you do not have a

WordPress meetup you can certainly

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,730
contact WordPress central and let them

00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,730
