Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Asheville 2019
Description: 
	You know the cliche about the reign of content- especially for search engine success- so I won’t repeat it. The problem: you have a boring business and can’t write content. Or, maybe, you are unable to get any of your content approved by difficult brand managers or lawyers.
Let me show you my process for coming up with topics for impossible companies and boring topics. I’ll show you strategies to get this content approved- by even the most persnickety members of your team. I’ll even give you some tips to make sure this content helps grow your SEO campaign in a way you never thought you’d see. As a bonus, I’ll help you produce content that will stand the test of time- even as Google moves toward voice searches.
Takeaways:
What makes content “good”?
Strategies to overcome boring industries or topics
Strategies to overcome difficult (legal/regulative) topics

oh don't need an introduction hi I'm

00:01:52,579 --> 00:02:01,119
David yeah oh well thank you I've been

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,909
called a lot worse

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,590
yeah no my name is David Zimmerman I own

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,420
a little marketing consultancy called

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,880
reliable acorn and out of Charlotte and

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,769
I appreciate you guys bringing me here

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,170
to talk today this is actually a

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,090
continuation of my talk last year which

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,790
was kind of about technical SEO and

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,130
everyone wanted to know about content so

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,049
I decided I bring a content talk this

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,250
time and I'm sure you'll have a lot of

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,569
technical questions at the end of that

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,750
so maybe next year I'll come up with a

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,940
technical anyway no I love doing SEO

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,700
I've been doing it for maybe ten years

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,470
or so now four years ago I went on my

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,769
own started my own little thing and

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:44,660
that's reliable acorn but feel free to

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:49,430
tweet me I'm still on the Twitter's I'd

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:53,389
love to reach out I this kind of topic

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:56,540
got started because I was at an agency

00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:59,720
and it was a real challenge to write for

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,450
some of my clients I don't write but I

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,329
would often assign out topics to writers

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,010
to write it just takes me a long time to

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,560
write so it's probably better for some

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,569
of you writers to write than me but even

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,500
my writers were would be stumped what

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,359
the heck should we write and if you know

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,870
anything about SEO you've probably heard

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:23,840
how important good content is for an SEO

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,630
campaign right Google is about the words

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,060
and we want to be found on Google we

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,130
have to use them now content could

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,169
technically be about a lot more than

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,269
words but I'm going to be talking about

00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,940
the words today not about video not

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,500
about images a lot of great people

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,970
around here have been talking about that

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,540
this weekend I'm gonna focus on the

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,780
words

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,549
but if we want good content we really

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,750
got to start by asking ourselves well

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,220
what what what is good you know

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,730
oftentimes people ask me David is it

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,829
good for SEO I don't know how to answer

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:02,209
that question because I don't know what

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:03,620
good is one of my friends kind of as I

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,269
was rambling one day about how

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,440
frustrating is when someone asked me is

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,540
it good for SEO

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,159
she asked well what you know what did

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,010
they really mean when they asked by that

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,930
and oftentimes when someone asks is

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,829
something is good for SEO they're saying

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:23,600
does it rank and you know rank is a

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:27,110
great thing but is that really what you

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,570
want because theoretically we could

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,970
think of any number of terms for which

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,470
you might be able to rank but rank

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,990
doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,510
get a visitor for it because just

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,669
because you think of a term doesn't mean

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,460
anybody else in the universe is thinking

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:51,289
of this term right now right so rank

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,229
isn't the end goal of good content we

00:04:51,289 --> 00:05:00,199
want rank that generates traffic because

00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:03,620
people are searching for it but we could

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,970
think of any number of phrases that

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:12,050
bring in traffic and that doesn't

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,710
necessarily help our website or our

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,870
clients because just because it brings

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,460
in traffic doesn't mean it's bringing in

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:27,560
customers so what we have to say is good

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:31,699
content accomplishes its purpose what do

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,630
we want the traffic to do when that

00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:38,150
comes to our site and and that can be

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,949
varied based on the type of content

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,870
you're producing if you're writing a

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,900
blog post you might have a different

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,639
purpose you want to accomplish than if

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,510
you're writing a landing page for

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,039
example write a landing page the purpose

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,960
that what you hope to accomplish is

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,529
someone landing on a page talking about

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,249
us

00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:01,309
service or a product that you offer is

00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:03,589
that they become a customer they contact

00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:06,139
you through your lead form they call you

00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:08,419
over the phone you want the purpose of

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,959
that landing page to bring in the

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:14,659
customer so don't be distracted by rank

00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:18,229
when we talk about SEL don't just think

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:20,269
about traffic either rank leads to

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,369
traffic if it's valuable but more

00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,879
importantly traffic helps accomplish

00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:31,399
your business goal from your site and

00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:34,549
that's what makes content good so if we

00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,109
talk about good content we have to talk

00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:39,499
for a moment about what are the

00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:43,999
requirements of something that makes it

00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:45,919
good for content wise and and the first

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:49,669
place we've got to start is focusing on

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:53,839
our audience now when I worked at an

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:55,809
agency I'm gonna say a bad word here I

00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,949
hope they don't bleep it out

00:06:55,809 --> 00:07:04,069
key word i forbade my team from using

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,489
the word keyword because because when

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:09,589
people think of the keyword that gets a

00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:12,679
laser-focused it becomes obsessed they

00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:14,779
become obsessed with that Google in its

00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:19,909
algorithm nowadays isn't necessarily

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,699
thinking of a keyword they're thinking

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:25,179
more in terms of topic for example a

00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,849
client of mine asked me the other day

00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:31,809
should we use the word cyber security or

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,779
cyber security

00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:38,539
the answer is mm-hmm

00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:41,659
who cares because Google knows it's the

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,129
same thing those of you guys doing SEO

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:45,079
for a while you remember when we used to

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,599
produce a page for lawyers and another

00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,049
page for attorneys right we used to do

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,949
that now Google knows they're synonymous

00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:53,389
if you're in England they might even

00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,999
include barrister in that I don't know I

00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,819
don't do SEO for lawyers in in England

00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:03,199
but the point is let's not think in

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:06,730
terms of the keyword let's think of in

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:11,990
terms of our audience

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:16,610
what do our potential customers search

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,290
for and when when we start to think

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,120
about what makes good content and we're

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,040
thinking about what our customers are

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,050
searching for this will also prevent us

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,050
