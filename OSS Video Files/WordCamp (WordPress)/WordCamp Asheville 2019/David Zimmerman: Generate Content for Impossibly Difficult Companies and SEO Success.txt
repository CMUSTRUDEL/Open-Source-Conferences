	You know the cliche about the reign of content- especially for search engine success- so I won’t repeat it. The problem: you have a boring business and can’t write content. Or, maybe, you are unable to get any of your content approved by difficult brand managers or lawyers.
Let me show you my process for coming up with topics for impossible companies and boring topics. I’ll show you strategies to get this content approved- by even the most persnickety members of your team. I’ll even give you some tips to make sure this content helps grow your SEO campaign in a way you never thought you’d see. As a bonus, I’ll help you produce content that will stand the test of time- even as Google moves toward voice searches.
Takeaways:
What makes content “good”?
Strategies to overcome boring industries or topics
Strategies to overcome difficult (legal/regulative) topics
