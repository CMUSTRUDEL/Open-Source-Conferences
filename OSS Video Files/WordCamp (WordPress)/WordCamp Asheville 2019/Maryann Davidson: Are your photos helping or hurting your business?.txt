LinkedIn and Hospital websites let's

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:08,819
choose a surgeon are we gonna go with

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,410
the recent graduate the fisherman how

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,180

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,510
Fridays

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,599
all too often we choose photos that are

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,879
good enough we need a photo so we take a

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,040
quick snapshot or grab any old photo

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,989
that's available not realizing the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,640
message that it's sending people just

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,349
start searching for hotels and

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,170
restaurants and doctors they're

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,569
searching for our businesses to 80

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,329
percent of people will research you and

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,640
your company online before making a

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,530
decision and on the Internet people

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,430
don't have to make excuses to walk away

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,109
and choose someone else so while it's

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,950
said we shouldn't judge a book by its

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:56,730
cover the reality is we all do it it's

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,829
just how our brains function imagine

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,959
searching online for a recipe without

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:06,359

going to buy

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,760

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,389
more to read more about what is being

00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:32,970
offered we thread over just the perfect

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,489
words and just the perfect font I spent

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,099
two days picking out a single font for

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,409
my business card but we can't spend all

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,069
our time on our words that we completely

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:46,919
forget our images your images are a

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:51,540
vital part of every aspect of your

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:54,629
marketing 90% of information transmitted

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,760
to our brains is visual visual

00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,970
information like those photos get to

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,750
your brain 60,000 times faster than text

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,750
here's an example

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,760
the deepest part of our brain the

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,350
survival part it's hardwired to form an

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:22,700
impression the instant we see someone

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:27,080
your subconscious brain makes a

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:30,890
conclusion about a person in less than

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,190
1/2 of 1/10 of a second so how can we

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,930
win someone over and less than a second

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,000
what's gonna make somebody searching on

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,980
the Internet stop and all of the sea of

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,060
people that are available and say I want

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:48,740
to do business with this person

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,270
the simple answer a connection people

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,070
want to do business with people that

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,250
they like know and trust

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:59,480
not faceless websites especially when it

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:02,120
comes to a service based business how

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,919
are we going to make that connection we

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,169
can do it through our headshots or

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,120
profile photos those all-important

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,070
business portraits which are commonly

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,340
referred to as a profile photo or a

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,620
headshot the headshot is the most

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,790
important photo on your website and

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:23,510
social media because it's the photo that

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,860
represents you it's the photo it's the

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,110
first thing that people see when they

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,830
browse your profile and it's the mental

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,350
image they are going to recall remember

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,870
we are hard-wired to form an impression

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,419
the instant we see someone we can't help

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,990
it so let's look at some common missed

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:47,570
opportunities that people do with those

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:51,229
all-important profile photos from a

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:58,370
psychology standpoint arms crossed say

00:05:51,229 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm closed off leaning away says doesn't

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:06,169
care makes us less approachable too far

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,640
away hints at insecurity it's hard to

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:13,880
establish trust with this person too

00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,770
close even in a photograph we don't like

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,319
it when somebody is in our personal

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,490
space

00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:25,869
- hi asserts dominance while tulo shows

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,119
weakness and lacks confidence and the

00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:31,360
selfies often have too many distractions

00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:33,159
especially the bathroom ones think about

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,180
all the information that is in front of

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:40,240
our eyes colors shapes lights movement

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,080
words texture all vying for our

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,449
attention remember you have less than a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,159
second in anything that distracts the

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,399
viewer is going to take away from

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:53,709
establishing that connection the

00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,080
opposite of the selfie the everybody

00:06:53,709 --> 00:07:00,490
photo which one are you there's no

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,389
personal connection and my personal

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,979
favorite the disembodied friend there's

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,059
no connection because we're all

00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,409
wondering who that person was and

00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:15,580
covering her eyes there's no connection

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:17,409
what are we hiding and looking away we

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,639
tend to follow the gaze of others so we

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:24,039
break that connection

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:27,339
and wide eyes makes us uncertain and

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,019
eager and tired eyes there's nurse no

00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:33,189
confidence it's hard to trust this

00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:35,499
person and clothing says so much this is

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:39,009
I would rather be anywhere else than

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:40,629
doing business today these people actual

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,649
LinkedIn photos would rather be anywhere

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:46,419
else

00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:49,029
than doing business poor lighting

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,339
creates wrinkles it ages us makes us

00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,759
less trustworthy seriously nobody wants

00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:57,479
that and a fake smile it doesn't

00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,279
generate trust most people can spot it

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,949
but we have an opportunity to make a

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,649
connection in less than a second how can

00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:08,050
we do that with a single photo we do it

00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,389
through that all-important headshot we

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,360
narrow it down to just our head and

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,519
shoulders because it reduces unnecessary

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,619
distractions giving us a better chance

00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,619
of establishing that instant connection

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,820
remember your headshots about you just

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,409
you connecting with your target audience

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,680
so for this type of photo look directly

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,680
into the camera because it communicates

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,680
credibility

00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,860
in a warm expression says I'm open to

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,860
connection

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,660
and a genuine smile makes us more

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:08,709
approachable and it's been said to

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:10,720
generate trust instantly and good

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:13,149
lighting makes us more trustworthy more

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,209
approachable and more radiant and a good

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:18,700
photographer can take it a step further

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:25,260
because while this is reality that is

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:33,399
marketing reality marketing reality

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:35,829
marketing we live in a highly

00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:40,630
competitive world and what you mark it

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:43,029
with matters your photos every single

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,010
one of your photos from your headshot to

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,790
all of your posts on social media are a

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,589
vital part of your marketing and

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,500
marketing is about standing out from

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,860
your competition connecting with and

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,050
engaging your target audience building a

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,020
brand reputation and boosting your

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,470
word-of-mouth and communicating that you

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,190
are worth every single dollar that you

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:15,250
are charging the right photos can

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:17,649
actually give you a competitive edge but

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,600
you have to make the effort when it

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,880
comes to that all-important headshot and

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,510
profile photos and all those photos on

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,760
your social media to stand out from the

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,420
competition and connect with your target

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,420
audience

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,260
think about this you make the extra

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,690
effort when you go on a job interview

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,649
you make the extra effort when you go on

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,820
a first date

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,620
why because we care about the impression

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,370
that we're giving to the person sitting

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,709
across from us your headshot is that

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,699
first impression and online it

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:58,260
represents you 24/7 365 so you have to

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:01,360
choose it carefully how do we do this

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,800
here's just one way this is something

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
that I do with my clients during

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,699
brainstorming sessions those

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,670
all-important strategy sessions for the

00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,770
sake of time we're

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,580
narrow this down to just two I'll put

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,440
that back up at the end fill in the

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,500
blanks with at least three positives

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,060
about yourself and your business what is

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,520
it that you're wanting people to know

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,990
about you to tell others like oh my

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,940
goodness you need to do business with

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:29,870
this web designer or this person because

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,580
they are fill in the blanks the words

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,070
that I most often hear from my clients

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,130
are I want to look approachable friendly

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,260
and professional but these words are

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,020
going to vary based on your profession

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,470
your unique personality and what it is

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,750
that sets you apart for example a

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,450
defense attorney might want their words

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,420
to be confident no-nonsense on top of

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,880
their game whereas a veterinarian might

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,550
want their words to be friendly

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,240
respectable and knowledgeable what are

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,770
your words

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,920
write them down then show your headshot

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,050
to five to ten people preferably clients

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,380
your target audience even random

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,690
strangers what is it that they say when

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,480
they look at that photo write down their

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,280
words and make a list once you have a

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,770
long list it's time to pull back out

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,920
your words and tally up all of the words

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,530
to your words match their words or is

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,510
there a disconnect are you showing the

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,810
world what it is that you think you're

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:37,490
showing the world you might like your

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,550
photo and it might be well lit but is it

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:44,960
connecting with and engaging your target

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:47,570
audience even the slightest variation in

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:51,790
facial expressions can turn someone away

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:54,710
or inspire them to connect with you

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,080
let's choose a headshot by a show of

00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:02,810
hands which one do you prefer there's no

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:04,580
wrong answer here A or B what if I told

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,650
you she was a real estate agent

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,650
A or B

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:17,470
what if I told you she was a book editor

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:23,020
A or B how about an attorney

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:25,000
A or B how many of you changed your mind

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,330
based on her profession and her target

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,550
audience with every photo that you post

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,529
on your website and social media you

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,650
have to keep your target audience in

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,380
mind what is going to connect with and

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,390
engage them then once you have chosen

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,400
the right photo it's time to update it

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,830
in all the places that your headshot is

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,440
on the internet it's in a lot of places

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:51,100
for the sake of time I'm going to go

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,070
over just a few of these do you have a

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,089
headshot on your about page when

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:00,160
somebody lands there to learn about you

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,230
how is the facial expression and the

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,540
body language are there distractions

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:09,850
what does your photo look like on your

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,250
about page have you looked at social

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,140
media and put a headshot there because

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,270
think about this our clients come to us

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,250
from all different channels across the

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,110
internet are you grabbing their

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,210
attention and connecting with them and

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,230
engaging them no matter where it is that

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,060
they're finding you specialty websites

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,670
do you have your services listed on

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,830
specialty websites what does your

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,630
headshot look like on there especially

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,320
compared to the competition that is

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,240
offering the same thing that you are my

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,450
favorite have you thought about those

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,089
job proposals by putting a really good

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,700
headshot and your job proposals you're

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,650
putting yourself in the room connecting

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,900
with and engaging the person that is

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:57,820
making a decision about who to award

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,470
that job to and reviews by placing a

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,630
headshot with reviews think about Amazon

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,400
earlier did you want to click on

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:07,600
anything and learn anything without the

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,150
photos by placing a photo with your

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,310
reviews you're increasing the likelihood

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,170
that people are going to read them which

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,860
increases your credibility and your

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,860
conversion rates

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,830
people come to us from many different

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,080
channels your product or service is just

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,270
one of many the consumer has to choose

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,060
from many of you in this room offers

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,690
similar services these are essentially

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,000
all sodas and yet they all market

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,010
themselves differently one of them

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,810
you're sharing with a friend another

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,440
your jumping off a mountains

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,600
how are you marketing yourself are your

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,940
photos connecting with and engaging your

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,830
target audience those words that you

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,420
wrote down are you conveying that are

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:57,550
you expressing that it's important that

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,880
you use images that are relevant and

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,380
cohesive to what it is that you do for

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,080
example these are both clothing

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,970
companies clothing company a is doing a

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,780
really good job using relevant and

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,820
cohesive images clothing company B it's

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,920
a little confusing about what it is that

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,810
they're selling and offering you

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,390
shouldn't confuse your target audience

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,160
as a tendency we do this on social media

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,770
we like the photo so we go ahead and

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,890
post it but is it going to connect with

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,780
and engage your target audience it's

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,520
important that we use images that show

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,310
what it is that we offer and the

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,340
problems that we solve for example this

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:40,240
is to architects if you were in need of

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,970
an architect is it architect A or B

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,740
that's going to inspire you that you're

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,320
gonna go oh my goodness what is it that

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,900
they can do for me a is doing a pretty

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,300
good job where B doesn't really show

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,950
anything to do with what they're

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,250
offering are the problems that they'd be

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,620
able to solve it's important that you

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,560
use images that inspire connection and

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,180
engagement so using this heat map tool

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,280
which is a tool used to show user

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,070
behavior red is where the viewers eyes

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,130
linger the most what is it that we can

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:14,050
learn as humans were attracted to the

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,900
human face and we tend to follow the

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,360
gaze of others so when you have a

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,330
headshot and you're wanting the viewer

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,180

directly into the camera have good body

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,080
language and a good facial expression

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,090
when you're wanting the viewer to enter

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,039
act with something like a product or

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,549
something else you want to turn your

00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:40,580
body or your head or your eyes towards

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:43,580
that product like the all-important

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,789
call-to-action button the buy more sign

up for this newsletter call us don't

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:50,149
look into the camera for this you want

00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:52,010
to look over at what it is you're

00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:56,450
wanting the viewer to actually interact

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,580
with your photos should do their job you

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,100
know what is that as a business your

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,519
photos are to entertain to educate to

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,539
inform to inspire provoke engage how are

00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,080
we going to go about getting those

00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:11,389
images we can hire a professional we can

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,490
purchase stock photos we can do it

00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:15,049
ourselves or we can do a combination of

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,960
any of these above so let's talk a

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,279
little bit about each of them

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,880
stock photography this is the one

00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,590
earlier they got the Lou there's do's

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,990
and don'ts of stock photography first

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,980
don't purchase cheesy images they just

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:33,529
don't connect with most people don't

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,450
select images for yourself make sure you

00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,190
keep your viewer in mind if you're

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,639
posting what's happening in your office

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,340
this is not what people do in an office

00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:45,260
environment and day to day this is more

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,090
like something that you would see in an

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,809
office this is more likely to connect

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:54,380
with your target audience don't select

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:56,090
random images so this is on hundreds of

00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,519
companies websites well it might work

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,049
well for the travel company not so much

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,450
for the oil change company that it's

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:07,130
advertising for don't choose an image

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,649
before you've done your homework and

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,750
research Google has where you can right

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:14,480
click on that image and go where else is

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,880
this on the internet for example the

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,120
girl in the car is on thousands of

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,399
companies websites over 100 car rental

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,440
companies over 100 car insurance

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:26,120
companies remember the whole point of

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,669
having a website is to show the world

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,279
I'm different look at me

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,049
do business with me it's hard to do that

00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,419
when you're using the exact same image

00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,850
as another company and especially your

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,980
competition it's hard to do that when

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,309
you're using the exact same spokesmodel

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,029
as thousands of other companies so you

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,590
have to

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,499
your homework before purchasing those

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,119
images and I would be dropping the ball

00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:52,700
if I didn't tell you there's study after

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,460
study showing that when you actually

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,139
replace the stock photo with real-life

00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,869
images of you and your company your

00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:01,249
conversion rates are going to increase

00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,559
here's two examples the top one is a

00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:05,749
moving company they swapped out the

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,099
stock photo with the real-life movers

00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:09,739
these are the people coming into your

00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:12,200
home and carrying away your worldly

00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:14,739
possessions when they swap that out

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,869
their conversions went up by 45 percent

00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:20,839
think about this who in here asks for

00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:22,879
the password from their clients they

00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,979
want to like know and trust you they're

00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:26,899
giving you their livelihood their

00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:29,899
password their business they want to

00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:31,849
trust that person the bottom image was

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:34,729
actually confusing while this laptops a

00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:36,289
pretty good stock photo this was not an

00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:39,229
online conference that you would think

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,539
of when you actually see a laptop it was

00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,639
an in-person conference so when they

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,219
swapped out the image from the previous

00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:51,710
year's participants their sign-up rate

00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:53,899
went up by over 40% and if you still

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,129
choose to use stock photos at least use

00:20:53,899 --> 00:21:00,489
the ones with Vince Vaughn and Dave

00:20:55,129 --> 00:21:02,899
Franco just saying DIY do-it-yourself

00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:07,429
photography how many of you like doing

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:09,080
photography oh yeah so there are so many

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,869
resources out there where you can learn

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,080
good lighting and good competition

00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:17,269
composition free you can learn online

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,889
photography not like I was 20-something

00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,409
years ago where you're just scouring to

00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:23,839
try to find stuff don't go out and buy

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:25,969
expensive equipment you have a really

00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,739
good cell phone in your pocket so if you

00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:29,899
learn to know what you're doing for

00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,789
those all-important social media posts

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,710
you can take really good compelling

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,629
images with that cell phone because the

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,039
best camera is the one that you have on

00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:41,809
you when you take images pay attention

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,429
to the details right is there a palm

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,609
tree sticking out the top of somebody's

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,349
head are there empty water bottles what

00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,509
is their body language are they closed

00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,580
off and leaning away what is their

00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,570
facial expressions really pay attention

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:59,260
the details of those photos

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,060
and then stockpile your own images those

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,380
words that you wrote down earlier you

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,090
know what it is you're wanting to convey

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,790
the world so as you just go about your

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,980
day to day think about those images that

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,560
you need and start taking and capturing

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,540
those images so when you need them down

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,000
the road you already have your own

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,430
stockpile of images here's a little

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,190
trick I tell my clients when you use

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,620
your cell phone to take images go ahead

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,840
and hit the favorites button so it goes

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,460
into a separate folder so a month from

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,320
now a year from now when you need that

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,420
image or not scrolling through thousands

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,580
of images to find that one for that blog

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,310
post you already have it in its own

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,170
folder and then as with anything just

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:42,190
practice practice practice and have fun

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:44,530
Photography is fun and hiring a

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,120
professional it's pretty easy first just

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,340
make a general list of what it is that

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,100
you need first you need a really good

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,190
compelling headshot how many pages do

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,900
you have on your website four okay now

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,450
you're up to five images that you need

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,980
take a couple of hours and knock that

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,810
out research photographers ask around if

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,450
you see somebody that has good images

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,140
ask them you know who did you use find

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,060
the right photographer for you look at

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,910
their website look at the facial

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:21,490
expressions you know if a photographer

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,140
ever asks you to smile smile pretend you

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,630
have an emergency gather your stuff and

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,030
leave because it's not your job it's the

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,370
photographer's job to entertain you

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,440
engage you and capture something genuine

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,380
that people are going to connect with

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,300
and engage with once you find the right

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,070
photographer go ahead and make an

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,470
appointment get it on your calendar if

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,990
you're like me it doesn't exist unless

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,320
it's on the calendar and a good headshot

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,550
should last you three to five years so

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,510
go ahead and take an hour of your time

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,510
