all right well I appreciate everybody

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,280
coming out I know it's the last one of

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,750
the day it's a struggle or honey wants

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,639
to go home

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,949
and you guys made time for this

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,970
extremely boring topic but extremely

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,189
important topic so I appreciate that I

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,980
got a ton of information to get through

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,830
I mean does everybody hear me annoyed me

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,720
this marker now you're good okay I got a

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,960
ton of information to get through really

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
uh

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,579
I wish they'd give me a three-hour

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,860
session but I don't have that so

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,230
afterwards I got cars if you guys have

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,760
any questions obviously this is the last

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,980
one so if it really won't be a happiness

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,200
bar but you can email me at any time and

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,820
I love absolutely love helping that's

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,989
that's how I continue to learn and

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,219
continue to get better

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,350
so I'm Jose I'm Philip rusty we're from

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,180
st. Pete design for a web development

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,570
company based out of st. Pete the Tampa

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,439
Bay area Florida we do web accessibility

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,110
remediation and custom custom software

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,520
the majority of our stuff is for

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,830
accessibility we do a ton of white

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,760
labeling as well so I get I get a lot of

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,409
those questions we ought to remediate we

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,900
teach how to get and stay compliant we

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,250
give accessibility talks and we build

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,170
software okay our story we attended the

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,509
class in the well we got a job for

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,009
accessibility a few years back and we

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,860
really didn't know anything about it so

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,290
we started our research phase and and

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,850
there really is not a lot out there and

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,890
what you can find

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,460
it's like that legalese speak it's all

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,350
government blue and white not for me

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
basically

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,939
but in our in our process of researching

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,829
we came across the NFB a National

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,299
Federation of the blind Convention it's

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,399
the biggest convention of the year for

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,990
blind people worldwide and it happened

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,060
to be in our backyard in Orlando let's

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,460
not Howard Drive so we wouldn't check

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,490
that out and it was just absolutely

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:07,590
mind-blowing it's just amazing of the

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,569
accessibility issues that that the low

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,730
vision individuals have it's it's just

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,290
it's amazing that's when we decided we

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,870
needed to make sure all of our sites and

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,060
software

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,400
compliant our little motto was one side

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,900
at a time we can't fix the whole the

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,870
whole internet but we can do our part

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,250
one side at a time and and I speak that

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,290
for everybody in here that that really

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,650
should be our mantra one website at a

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,090
time that's how we realized how

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,430
difficult was defining from any

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,319
information as a developer and how to be

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,209
compliant so we decided to just cobble

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,489
everything together and help because we

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,409
just wanted to help and you know I've

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,799
taken my hundreds and hundreds of hours

00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,810
worth of research and tried to to put it

00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,280
together and give it to you guys and if

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,500
there's and there's a ton of more

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,480
information that I have and resources

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,569
besides what I offer here so what I

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,370
don't get to please email me if I can't

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,579
answer your question I will send you the

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,290
resource for it I promise you I got it

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,650
all right with all that said this is web

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,359
accessibility made easy for WordPress

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,310
this talk outline I'm gonna give you

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:12,579
some facts in an explanation of what

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,950
section 508 or way CAG is and then I'm

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,980
going to offer you our 11 easy steps to

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,720
be compliant as developers and at the

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,060
end of that I've got some free developer

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,019
tools and resources that I'll give you

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,970
guys and we'll go over all right start

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,190
off with a few facts over 1 billion

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,970
people worldwide have some sort of

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:37,930
disability that's a huge huge number and

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,400
of that in estimated 253 million people

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,599
worldwide have a have a vision

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,160
disability and that that's what we try

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,019
to focus on because we think that's the

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,260
biggest hurdle for the Internet is the

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,419
low vision and of that 253 million

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,299
estimate in 19 million children

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,629
worldwide have have are visually

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,769
impaired I have two daughters and

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,109
watching them with technology the way

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,519
they're intertwined these days it's

00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,730
amazing and I just can't imagine

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,620
children not having access to the

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,799
Internet the way we do it's just so

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,079
ingrained in our lives

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,709
alright this is a big one here there

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,579
were 814 section 508 lawsuits in 2017

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:24,219
there are over 2,200 lawsuits last year

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,260
now that number is even bigger than what

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:30,150
then what this says because

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,590
this is the government that these are

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,140
lawsuits filed under the federal

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,880
government some states differ so a lot

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,560
of salt lawsuits get filed under the

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,680
state level so they don't even make it

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,840
to the government level and a little fun

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,670
fact is you would think that all the

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,980
lawsuits would be from section 508

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,650
non-compliance but the majority of them

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,080
are from the from the title three from

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,900
the ad a title three specifies that any

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,140
user disabled or not has to have the

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,710
same access to whatever it is that the

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,780
average person does think of the blue

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,310
handicap parking spaces think of ramps

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,760
when you're walking up think of

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,040
bathrooms with handrails those are ad a

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,130
title three things I own a restaurant in

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,570
st. Petersburg so when an individual

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,070
they have to have access to my bathroom

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,480
they have to have access to be able to

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,040
get the wheelchair up the ramp and in

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,560
the door they have to have a table for

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,270
them that's just the way it is and now

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,610
what it is is those laws are now

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:31,110
transferring over to the internet which

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:34,890
is a big deal there's a little graph

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:40,890
right here you can see 2015 we had 57

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:43,950
lawsuits 2016 262 814 over 2,200 you can

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,320
see the exponential growth and we've

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,840
already gotten pretty close to this

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,080
number this year I haven't checked in

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,570
the last month or two so we've probably

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,000
exceeded the 2,200 lawsuits as of

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,800
year-to-date so you can just see this

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,770
growth it's going nuts

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,990
Enda and the most the states of the most

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,600
lawsuits are new york in florida of the

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,330
2,200 I think New York's got about 15

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,830
1,600 Florida's got about 500 and the

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,050
other 100 or two is split up between all

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,690
the other states so you can see it's a

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,150
big deal but I will say this I just was

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,610
at wordcamp Orange County a few months

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:26,550
ago and I learned that just California

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,230
alone had over 2000 lawsuits begin those

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,240
lawsuits weren't filed under the federal

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,750
they were filed under state so they're

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,210
not included in this in this stat so the

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,919
point is it's coming it's here it's

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,770
coming and it's gonna get even bigger

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,690
rightfully so

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,789
okay this is just a little stat I threw

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,180
in here three dozen lawsuits filed in 12

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:50,090
months by the same person he all in

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,120
Florida and you could see if you look up

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,250
the the plaintiffs and stuff you can see

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,870
that I think out of that twenty two

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,880
hundred lawsuits there was under thirty

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,639
under thirty people that did all the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,949
filing so that's what happens when

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,900
things get real stuck you know it takes

00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,460
a real hard push in the opposite

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,229
directions to break loose and then we

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,819
can kind of veer back to the center and

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,349
I think that's where we're at with

00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,599
accessibility there's been a complete

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:17,030
lack of it so these guys are pushing

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,030
real hard to make it happen and then

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,520
we'll kind of veer back to the middle

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:26,060
all right what is section 508 and wake

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,310
egg wake ad 2.1 it's the web content

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,310
accessibility guidelines these are

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,159
basically the worldwide guidelines that

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,130
they put out for accessibility for or

00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:40,220
the entire world section 508 is

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,110
basically the American version and that

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,699
says that all government agencies and

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,030
anybody doing business with government

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,030
agencies contractors anything their

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,940
website has to be section 508 compliant

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:56,509
and section 508 compliance basically

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,860
just says you got to be waked well let

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,430
me back up wake egg has three different

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,080
levels you got a double-a and triple-a

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,969
section 508 it's American version says

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,810
that you have to be level a and double-a

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:10,460
compliant of wake egg so I mean you can

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,469
be wake at if you're fully awake a

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,210
compliant your section 508 compliant if

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,370
you're fully section 508 compliant

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,830
you're still not wake a compliant but in

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,830
America we're worried about section 508

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,169
all right wake eggs four main ideas

00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:30,340
number one is perceivable this has to do

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,450
with text text alternative media

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,620
adaptable distinguish all you want to

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,490
make sure that the individual can

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,190
perceive your content operable keyboard

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,440
access accessible enough time seizure is

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,350
navigable you got to make sure that your

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,130
site's operable you got to see it you

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,829
got to navigate it understandable has to

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,580
do with readability predictable input

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,650
assistance

00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,750
you got to be able to understand it and

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:02,400
it's uh will get a little deeper into

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,740
understanding that has to do with like

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,650
your semantics and the way your site's

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,000
laid out robust you got to make sure

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,670
your software is robust enough to work

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,830
with lots of accessibility accessible

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,620
technology screen readers and things

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,630
like that and don't just think about

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,090
being accessible or being able to use

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,950
assistive technology today think about

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,540
two years down the road four or five

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,180
seven years down the road we all know

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,650
how technology just just flips every

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,320
year it just keeps getting bigger and

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,910
better so make sure you're robust enough

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,140
to work years down the road because we

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,880
don't want to come back to our site two

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,150
years from now and have to redo all this

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,730
work the point of this talk is really so

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,980
I can get everybody to include these

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,980
steps and their process of designing and

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,010
developing your website so that way you

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,810
incur very little extra time very little

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,500
extra money and you just make the site

00:09:51,810 --> 00:10:02,430
successful from the get-go all right why

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:03,900
does section 508 exist this is why no

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,050
matter how much time you spend on your

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,720
site all the pretty fonts all the pretty

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,660
colors all those sliders and animation

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,030
that amazing drop-down that menu this is

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,270
what a low vision user sees nothing

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,210
don't see nothing this is why it's

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,700
important all right

00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,500
now I'm gonna give you our 11 easy step

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,760
to help with their compliance this is a

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,270
good picture for everybody to take if

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,980
you're interested I will say this you

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,590
can follow every single one of these

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,770
steps to the T and you're still not

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,750
compliant more than likely I'll be here

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,150
all day telling you about what you got

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,860
to do to be compliant my point the

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,940
purpose of this is again is to give you

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,130
the things that I think are the most

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,450
important and the easiest for you to

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,480
implement that'll make the biggest

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,180
difference without incurring tons of

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,310
hours that you got a then you know

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:02,520
charge your client thousands of extra

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:04,440
dollars all right number one provide

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,260
alternative text for all your non text

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,790
content

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,730
let me ask how many people are

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,210
developers here okay

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,950
agencies or anything okay it's pretty

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,840
much everybody should be familiar with

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,450
where I'm at here this is your media

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,210
library when you upload a picture this

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,030
is what it looks like you got your you

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,560
got your alt text over here and that's

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,270
that's that's where you want to hit your

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,710
alternative text this is an image this

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,290
was at the National Federation of the

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,430
blind this is a real thing I just want

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,280
to throw that out there see with your

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,800
tongue that's a real thing that's not

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,970
made-up that was at the blind convention

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,010
and I was just blown away so okay here's

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,560
a close-up of it basically in the alt

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,180
text you just want to hit you want to

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,140
describe the picture a picture of a

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:59,720
device that allows you to see with your

00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,310
tongue and we've got the next one the

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,050
cool thing is a little Gutenberg update

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,850
there's two ways you can have a picture

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,800
your picture either all pictures either

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,720
neither he either have an alternative

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,730
text or it needs to be labeled as

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,160
decorative or with like an Ulta or

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,510
something but Gutenberg allows you when

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,660
you upload your picture you can just

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,070
simply click this and it'll mark it as

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,630
decorative and what that does is the

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,490
screen reader skips right over because

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,570
there's no extra information in that

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:31,520
picture all right we got label form

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:34,220
elements everybody I'm sure just about

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,690
everybody here's got a some sort of form

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,880
on their site some sort of contact

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,000
that's formed this is a contact contact

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,470
seven form and then you got a hat you

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,580
got it you got a label your form

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:51,470
elements now most most of these will do

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,650
that like contact form seven will do it

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,010
naturally but if you go in and add extra

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,450
form elements it will not add those

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,540
those labels for you so you're gonna

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:06,080
have to manually add those in and also

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,420
Rob Rob Dawson Dotson he's him he's a

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,340
real big accessibility expert he

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,930
actually built a plugin for contact form

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,790
seven that fixes a lot of accessibility

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,380
issues so look for that if you use

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,380
contact form seven that'll help you out

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,660
again this is just how you do it they

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,370
all pretty much come with it again

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,030
unless you unless you're adding them

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,850
yourself okay you want to add manuscript

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,830
or closed captions here videos for

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,160
videos and audio description for

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:39,540
animations an example of closed captions

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,370
basically this is one of our videos and

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,240
how many people here have used YouTube

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,370
to upload a video alright so we all know

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,830
it's very easy I mean this this is this

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,600
is what we recommend not not for

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,820
accessibility but just for the ease of

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,350
it and accessibility the uploaded video

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,880
you get your little your little

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,420
shortcode you put it on your site you're

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,700
good to go

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,670
but em and there when you're editing

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,670
