Title: Keanan Koppenhaver: Modern WordPress Tools for Developers
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	It used to be that WordPress required a very different toolset than other types of modern PHP apps. Now, however, PHP developers can use many of the same tools to work with WordPress that they would use with Laravel or any other PHP framework.
In this talk, we’ll look at how to modernize development of WordPress sites by using Bedrock to give us a modern stack, WP-CLI to interface with WordPress through the command line or even create scripts to run operations, how to use composer and plugins specifically designed for developers, and ways to deploy WordPress that are easier and more stable than FTP. In addition, we’ll talk about new considerations that Javascript is bringing to the WordPress ecosystem.
Come take a look at how the WordPress ecosystem is maturing in 2019 and beyond!

well good afternoon everybody it's 3:10

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,720
so we're gonna go ahead and get started

00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,020
thanks for sticking around for the the

00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,879
last talk in this room today we're Camp

00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,110
Dayton it's my first time here but kind

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,400
of exploring the area my brother's out

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,060
in Beaver Creek so excited to be here

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,110
with you all in from Chicago so to kind

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,490
of wrap up here today we're gonna learn

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,690
a little bit about modern tooling with

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,720
WordPress if you couldn't have guessed

00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,670
from the slide in front of you my name

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,320
is Keenan my parents blessed me with a

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,940
very unique name both first and last so

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,399
I get this handle on pretty much every

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,890
social network you can also email me

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,120
which I check way too much and instead

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,620
of like trying to write down every link

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,019
and every name of everything you see in

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,120
the talk I put up a page at alpha

00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:47,609
particle comm /wc Dayton with all the

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,899
links to everything so you can kind of

00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,149
go there and peruse the links to the

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,039
slides are also there as well as

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,600
WordCamp TV if and when that becomes

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,300
available

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,589
so WordPress is turning 16 this year a

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,149
couple other talks have mentioned that

00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:02,399
but it's been around for a while

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,090
obviously very different from when it

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,190
started but it's it's evolving as an

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,020
ecosystem and as a community

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,920
so when WordPress kind of started out at

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,590
least when I started working with

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,869
WordPress most all of the options for

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,210
hosting where your your basic kind of

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,950
shared hosting platforms where you got

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,390
cPanel and you got FTP access that was

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,219
pretty much it

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,960
initially WordPress didn't have great

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,939
support for custom fields and things so

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,799
if you wanted to do that you had to dig

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,600
up the docs for add meta box and figure

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,109
out how to do all the saving of your

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,609
stuff custom it was pretty tough because

00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,320
the stuff was on shared hosting to do

00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,609
like monitoring or figure out which

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,530
parts your application were slow and

00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,390
kinda what was going on there

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,109
and a lot of what WordPress started with

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,340
was small to medium blogs so now you

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,869
know contrasting you kind of see that

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,579
it's evolved into more of an application

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,179
platform and really big websites are

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,009
running on it some of these up here

00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:01,469
I hope this least one name up here you

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,789
recognize so all of these companies have

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,429
web presences on the WordPress platform

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,929
so you know kind of thinking about how

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,070
they might manage this process knowing

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,980
they have a bunch of developers working

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,300
on our platform it becomes easy to see

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,650
that they're probably not dragging

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,420
dropping files with FTP

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,370
so how has

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,310
WordPress evolved to support these kind

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,620
of large-scale deployments and and what

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,880
can we learn from that to make our own

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,840
work more efficient even if we're not

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,310
working on on big things like that so

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,830
these are all linked up on the page as

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,180
well kind of some looks at this a

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,880
different version of this talk that I've

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,610
done a cloud scale WordPress talk put on

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,500
by the folks at AWS so pretty big name

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,030
they're talking about how you can deploy

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,610
WordPress into the cloud if that's your

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,569
game and also this talk so if this is

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,970
something interesting and learning about

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,430
you're in the right spot if you're not

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,780
then like we said earlier I won't be

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,610
offended if you decide to leave so the

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,690
overarching theme of this talk as I was

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,010
kind of going through and putting

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,470
together I realized that a lot of the

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,230
stuff that kind of can take WordPress to

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,110
the next level is taking actions that

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,000
you would traditionally do in the admin

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,730
setting up plugins or installing things

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,500
or you know configuring custom fields

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,870
and options like that and defining them

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,010
in code you could put code in quotes if

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,980
you want to because it's kind of a

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,230
different format in some cases but this

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,540
makes it really easy to keep track of

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,799
what's going on across multiple

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,600
environments so if you're working on

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,459
your local and then you're moving to a

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,359
staging environment you're moving to a

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,980
production like you don't have to

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,350
recreate all the fields in the admin

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,880
every time it also makes it easier to

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,920
work with multiple people because you

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,900
can version control your entire project

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,030
and then when someone new joins the team

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,230
they can grab the repository and all of

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,660
the kind of settings for various things

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,100
are in there so as you scale up

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,980
WordPress like this configuration is

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,329
code idea is a lot more important and so

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,790
if that doesn't quite make sense yet

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,940
we'll go through a bunch of examples but

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,079
that's gonna be key so that's kind of

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,269
the high-level overview of everything

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,380
we're gonna go into one more thing I

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,239
want to say before we get started is

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,430
like this I don't use all of these tools

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,980
on every project I wouldn't suggest that

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,299
you do either and the idea is not for

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,880
you to implement everything you see here

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,760
but hopefully you have a specific

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,079
problem either you know about already or

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,100
you'll realize when you see one of these

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,019
tools that you might be able to help you

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,120
out and you can pick just like one or

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,520
two things and go implement those that's

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,570
the idea so not to overwhelm you we're

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,740
gonna go through a lot of stuff but

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,080
hopefully you kind of one or two things

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,140
resonates with you and you can makes you

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,030
more efficient on your next project

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,950
so the first thing we're to talk about

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,320
is local environment so I'm assuming

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,000
mostly developers in the room how many

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
of us are using a local environment

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,950
developing on our computer somehow

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,510
someway good cool this wasn't really a

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,040
thing at least for me and the people I

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,690
was working with when I started there's

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,120
pretty much again like we had our FTP

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,590
target and we you know put files on

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,690
there and made changes in there and made

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,890
changes in the admin but local

00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,740
environments are great because they let

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,630
us work locally not on the live site and

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,370
test things out and and develop features

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,020
over a longer period of time without

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,670
having to worry that like we're breaking

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,670
the experience on the live site or it's

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,620
gonna go down like that so the first

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,840
option that technically is a local

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,180
environment is you can just install PHP

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,380
and my sequel kind of on your machine

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,570
especially if you have a Mac that's

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,690
really easy I think it comes with PHP

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,280
and maybe my sequel already installed

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,870
the problem with this is you know if

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,120
you're working on multiple projects and

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,250
one needs a different version of PHP or

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,050
need to upgrade or something need you

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,510
know kind of gets off

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,850
that's your machine so you really have

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,170
no option to just like destroy it and

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,620
start over because that's your whole

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:45,010
machine so possible but I would not

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,770
recommend it so something that's become

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,390
pretty popular in recent years is the

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,060
idea of running a tool called vagrant

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,680
inside VirtualBox so what this

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,370
essentially does is it creates a virtual

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,980
machine inside your computer and

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,090
everything is self-contained in here so

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,530
what's great about this is you can

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,240
install if you have a project that

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,920
requires specific versions of things you

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
can install just those specific versions

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,270
in kind of this virtual machine you can

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,790
turn it on and off as you need to you

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,400
can have a bunch of them running side by

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,630
side actually so we'll jump to this in a

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,340
little bit but these so these are all

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,960
the various like virtual machines that I

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,950
have on my computer so you know you see

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,080
local by Firewheel which is a tool we'll

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,520
talk about it has its own there for when

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
I need a test up internet explorer I

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,900
have a machine that I can turn on and

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,130
off to do that and there's so there's

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,290
just a bunch of various things that I do

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,410
here but it's nice because it's

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,230
self-contained and you can work with it

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,700
specifically yeah

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:47,650
so vagrant I believe works with

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:51,970
VirtualBox and a couple others VMware I

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,770
believe that can do but yeah you can

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,210
when you when you download it you can

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,200
specify what you want to work with

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,580
thought maybe would be quick here but I

00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,140
think you I think you can do with oh

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,970
yeah there's a link to VMware up here so

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,860
yeah you can do it with VMware you just

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,360
have to tell it when you when you look

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,040
for your vagrant box that we want to do

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,830
VMware so what is vagrant exactly so

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,850
it's a it's a virtual machine hooking

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,130
into one of these virtual machine

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,260
virtualization tools so VirtualBox or

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,360
VMware or whatever with a specific

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,890
configuration that's defined in what's

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,380
called a vagrant file so again this idea

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,000
of configuration is code this vagrant

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,770
file you say you know what based

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,970
operating system do you want how much

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,560
RAM do you want to give it from your

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,390
machine what you know you can define all

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,660
these things what what software do you

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,040
want to install and basically then you

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,630
have this self-contained environment you

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,520
tell favorite ok bring up this machine

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,900
and it if it's the first time you're

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,280
running it it goes and grabs all those

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,620
resources for you and creates the

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,390
virtual machine but then like I said you

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,160
can just turn it on and off as you need

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,200
to and once you've done the work of

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,250
initially creating it and downloading

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,320
everything you need it comes up pretty

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,970
quick just like you know starting up

00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,320
your computer versus getting it from the

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,250
store and installing the OS and all that

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,560
stuff so because it's it's it's own

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,760
separate machine you can get access into

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,110
it and upgrade packages on it

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,110
independently you can upgrade the whole

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,720
box if you want it really is just like a

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,710
machine inside your machine so we

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,940
already talked about this a little bit

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,820
kind of all the various ones that I have

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,370
running so it kind of goes on a

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,480
case-by-case basis homestead we'll talk

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,550
about a little bit but that's running

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,680
like I don't know 10 or 15 sites on

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,300
there and then some of these are just

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,920
for individual specific projects so you

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,330
can either have one machine that

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,580
encompasses a whole lot of projects or

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,020
if you just need you know one machine

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,670
for one project like I said you can turn

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,270
them on and off so they're not sucking

00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,770
up all the resources in your computer so

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,750
so one good option that's targeted

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,310
specifically to our WordPress is varying

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,010
vagrant vagrants don't try to say that

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,140
five times fast basically what it is is

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,440
it's a wrapper around vagrant that lets

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,140
you spin up and create you know

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,850
sites much more easily so again it does

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,190
configuration as kind of a code based

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,870
thing if we wanted to create a site for

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,130
this conference we could just basically

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,380
say okay we're gonna create a site

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,450
called Dayton we want the host to be

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,800
taken test you could do Dayton local

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,440
whatever you want it to be on your local

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,850
machine and then it supports templates

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,020
so basically this template is just kind

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,850
of their getting started one it's a very

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,730
basic one that just installs WordPress

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,930
and a couple of their debugging plugins

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,090
but basically you just specify this in

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,160
your config tell vagrant okay I want to

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,050
go run this and bring it up and then you

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,190
have a wordpress site inside this kind

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,320
of virtual environment so that's really

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,360
great as opposed to you know having to

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,610
go download all the WordPress core files

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,930
and then you know put them in a folder

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,750
and configure the database and then

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,980
change your WP config and all that stuff

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,990
it's really a lot quicker just to kind

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,850
of bring that stuff up and it's all

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,050
inside of virtual machines so if you do

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,160
this and then you decide you don't need

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,480
a site anymore you can delete it and

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,880
tell vigor to get rid of it or you can

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,580
spin down the whole virtual machine and

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,260
go from there

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,460
homestead is another option it was built

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,900
originally in the lair of all community

00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,010
so it's not it doesn't have as many

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,330
WordPress specific options as vvb does

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,690
but it's also based on vagrant so it's

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,340
much the same idea it's a very similar

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,440
syntax so in this case you have to tell

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,140
it where so all of my various sites live

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,280
in my code folder and on the virtual

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,370
machine I want that to be in-home

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,780
vagrant code so then once that mapping

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,070
of folders is set up you can just say ok

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,110
I want a new site here and whenever

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,580
somebody hits this URL it has to go look

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,770
in this folder which is where all my

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,240
wordpress code is gonna be this is a

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,110
much more manual process because I have

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,540
to actually make sure that WordPress

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,030
exists in that folder and that all my

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,470
config is set up correctly but again if

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,050
you work on stuff that's not just a

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,520
wordpress this is a good option because

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,050
you know and this virtual machine

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,230
I have WordPress and laravel projects

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:44,290
living side by side so it's kind of nice

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,970
that way so then also another option is

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,500
docker this is a question mark after

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,270
because I'm not super familiar with

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,830
docker it's one of those things that's

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,240
like sitting over here and I know I need

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,190
to learn it eventually because it has

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,780
some benefits over a virtual machine I'm

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,790
just can't really quantify that so

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,650
there's any doctor people here let's

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,690
chat later because that'd be awesome

00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,670
but but 10 up a relatively large

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,680
WordPress agency has a setup called WP

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,390
local docker which will get you up and

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,020
running

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,390
if doctors your thing cool so we've got

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,520
a local environment set up what are we

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,840
gonna do about actually developing so we

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,700
talked about some workflow things that

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,320
were kind of clunky in the past with you

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,580
know FTP and versioning and all that

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,060
stuff and even just working on the site

00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:28,500
itself kind of how can we how can we put

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,450
these things together so a big kink in

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,620
the workflow of the past was if you

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,330
wanted to install a plugin you either

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,640
had to go through the admin or download

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,340
a zip file and then drop it in your

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,700
plugins folder activate it through the

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,740
admin and stuff like that but in recent

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,590
years there's a tool called composer

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,840
that's being used in PHP brought more

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,240
broadly but specifically for WordPress

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,430
there's a tool called W packages which

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,020
is kind of a play off of packages which

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,020
is a composer of pilot ory for the

00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,300
bigger PHP community and what it allows

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,770
you to do is every public plug-in on the

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,900
WordPress plug-in repository is mirrored

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,400
here so if you are familiar with

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,740
composer and you know how to use that to

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,350
manage PHP packages show of hands how

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,060
many people is that by the way not too

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,930
many okay so real quick

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,520
composer basically is again a tool that

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,140
lets you specify one file and it says

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,580
you can specify here's all of the

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,350
packages that I need to run my software

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,940
so before you start running something

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,520
you can just say composer install and it

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,930
will go grab all of those different PHP

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,420
libraries for you so you can run your

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,310
code and again these are specified in a

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,740
file so that if you check your code into

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,150
version control you don't need to tell

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,400
another developer oh make sure you

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,200
install these five packages they just

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,390
can get the file and then have composer

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,000
install everything for them so much in

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,190
the same way W package just allows us to

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,070
manage plugins in this exact same way so

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,350
you can in your composer file list out

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,210
all the plugins that your site needs to

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,620
operate and then check that into version

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,300
control so that when someone downloads

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,280
all your code to start working on the

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,560
project they can just run composer

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,210
install and it will take care of putting

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,850
all the necessary plugins into the

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,890
plugins folder so you don't really have

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,360
to manage this then through you know an

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,350
onboarding doc that says hey here's all

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,550
the plugins your through installers of

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,740
some of the other ways that people have

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,330
done this in the past you can just let

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,880
the tools help you and automatically

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,570
install

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,310
for you so yeah seems like maybe not

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,390
super useful for all of us here but if

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,820
you use composure already you're

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,260
familiar with this if you experience the

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,060
headaches involved with telling people

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,630
which of the 20 plugins they need to run

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,800
it local

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,300
definitely look into this a little bit

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,350
another thing is for awhile there was

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,000
kind of this common perception that

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,320
plugins are basically just for you know

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,480
functionality on the site or for

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,830
end-users but but there's a lot of

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,210
plugins that are specifically targeted

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,390
towards people who are working on sites

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,660
and building things so one of these is

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,740
objects to objects in my opinion this is

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,700
one of the times where if this is a

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,380
requirement of what you're building

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,990
WordPress maybe is not a super great

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,790
choice for it but if you have to you can

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,450
basically relate like the title says

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,010
objects to objects so if you have posts

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,870
and say galleries and you want to make

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,190
sure certain galleries are related to

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,140
certain posts and you want to have this

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,430
connection so that on the post page you

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,250
can just play all the related galleries

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,990
things like that objects can be anything

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,980
so objects can be users objects can be

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,750
custom post types posts I believe even

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,440
comments and things like that pages

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,610
obviously so you can kind of make these

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,220
connections and it makes it much easier

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,480
to on the front-end then display these

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,540
objects that are related as opposed to

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,900
having to you know go into WP DB or make

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,210
direct database calls do that this is a

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,680
little small and this is mostly for the

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,790
slides if you go download them online to

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,170
see kind of how it sets up this

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,880
connection but this is exactly what we

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,560
were talking about earlier where we want

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,190
to be able to relate galleries to a

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,480
single post so just again this idea is

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,710
like okay we're not defining this

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,580
relationship anywhere in the admin or

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,840
doing anything like that we're actually

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,370
putting it in the code so this would

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,890
either go in a plugin that we were

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,240
building or or in a theme that says hey

00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,920
we know we're gonna have this post I've

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
called galleries and we want to relate

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,880
it to posts so that we can it then also

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,260
gives you an admin interface for

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,720
whoever's writing the content to make

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,220
those relations and things like that so

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,620
take a look at this online if you're

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,390
interested but just know that that's

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,440
there so field manager is another one

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,730
I'm willing to buy the lots of us here

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,720
have used advanced custom fields or

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,720
something to that effect

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,889
field manager is a similar situation

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
where you can define custom fields and

00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:31,750
then have them magically show up in the

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,670
admin but you know as we go through this

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,829
and keep thinking about our common theme

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,600
these are defined in code so while ACF

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,100
is great and it has an awesome admin

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
interface and lets you do all sorts of

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,779
customization field manager actually

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,540
lets you do this in code so once again

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:50,110
it can be version controlled and it can

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,399
be you don't have to you know recreate

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,170
those same fields when you move between

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,060
environments and things like that so ACF

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,220
does have kind of an export where you

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,510
can generate all the code in the fields

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,820
in the admin and then export it to code

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,000
field manager is kind of skips that step

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,750
and lets you write the code directly so

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,949
not something that everyone's

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,360
comfortable with if you rather would

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,019
have that admin interface like that's

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
great

00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,649
but if you're more working on a project

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,670
with a bunch of people and want to make

00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:14,500
sure all your fields are version

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,649
controlled things like that field

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,970
manager is great and yes ACF honorable

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:23,709
mention we talked about kind of pros and

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:25,360
cons of that so this is just how adding

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,910
a group of fields would look with field

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,680
manager so as you just specify we have a

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,600
group of fields in this case we'll just

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,089
add you know contact information to a

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,529
post for example we want a text field

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,260
for name a text field for a number and

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,320
then a link to the office website we'll

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,120
say and then you see the last line there

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,649
just add meta box contact information so

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,290
it'll just add a box below the post that

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:48,940
says you know here's the here's the

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,220
field we want it handles all the things

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,640
about saving them and and sanitizing the

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,290
input and stuff like that more details

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,540
to come on how this works with Gutenberg

00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,980
but in the past with kind of the classic

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,290
editor this was how it would setup the

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,399
different meta boxes so if you need

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,799
custom fields and you feel comfortable

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:10,419
writing PHP this is a solid option for

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:12,059
you query monitor I'm sure a lot of us

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:14,110
have dealt with the situation where

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,809
client calls up and says hey you know my

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,870
page is taking 5 10 15 20 seconds to

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,280
load I once got that call in number was

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,400
60 seconds which is a whole fun

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,990
different thing query monitor is a tool

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,730
that sits right up in the top that

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,400
little black admin bar that everyone

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,070
tries to hide query monitor sits up

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,030
there on every page load and if you have

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,970
PHP notices PHP

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,230
warnings PHP errors it will turn

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,370
different colors to kind of alert you to

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,679
the fact that hey something's going on

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,940
but it also profiles things like

00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,350
database queries so if you have a

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,610
particular section of your template

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,890
that's making a really slow database

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,830
query on it'll call that out in bright

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,480
red text for you it's super

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,000
comprehensive in terms of what it will

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,070
do the first time you use it you'll

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,409
probably use it for one specific thing

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,190
that it does and then for you lose it

00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,870
for a different thing on a different

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,480
project and I would not recommend trying

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,490
to understand all of it at once but if

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,010
you have something that's kind of

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,960
weirdly happening or you have a check

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,340
like you're checking is single and

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,590
that's not returning true when you

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,179
expect it to be it gives a lot of

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,860
information into like what WordPress

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,210
thinks it's loading what templates that

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,909
thinks it's loading what database query

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,650
is each component of the page is making

00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,510
and stuff like that so if you do a lot

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,250
of work with inheriting projects that

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,409
you then need to upgrade or fix and

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,669
things like that this is great career

00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,640
monitor would definitely recommend

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,260
checking it out and yes you'll have to

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,200
unhide the admin bar for it to be pretty

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,610
useful while you're working on the site

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,289
rewrites are another area of WordPress

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,780
that's kind of a black box in a lot of

00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,549
ways who's worked on like doing custom

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,330
rewrite stuff here before couple people

00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:53,270
yeah so it's more of that regex fun that

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:56,169
Steve was talking about before and it's

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,169
