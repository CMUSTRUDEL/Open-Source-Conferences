Title: Keanan Koppenhaver: Modern WordPress Tools for Developers
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	It used to be that WordPress required a very different toolset than other types of modern PHP apps. Now, however, PHP developers can use many of the same tools to work with WordPress that they would use with Laravel or any other PHP framework.
In this talk, we’ll look at how to modernize development of WordPress sites by using Bedrock to give us a modern stack, WP-CLI to interface with WordPress through the command line or even create scripts to run operations, how to use composer and plugins specifically designed for developers, and ways to deploy WordPress that are easier and more stable than FTP. In addition, we’ll talk about new considerations that Javascript is bringing to the WordPress ecosystem.
Come take a look at how the WordPress ecosystem is maturing in 2019 and beyond!
