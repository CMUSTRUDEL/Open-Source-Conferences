Title: Elizabeth Pampalone: Increase Productivity By Using A Builder
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	As perfectionists, admit it, you are one, we can spend hours on a site to get it just so. What if there was a way to achieve Just So, but faster? I want to dive into the time saving features a builder can offer. Not to mention the increased revenue streams buy using a builder. Donâ€™t let the idea of builder keep you away from the freedom it can provide. Come see what the builder business is all about!
Major takeaway would be to expose the general audience to the the time saving and integration features that are already in a builder eliminating the use of extra plugins and preventing vulnerabilities.

there's also a link to get dizzy with my

00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:56,150
favorite builder which we'll talk about

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,350
at the end of the slideshow but we're

00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,360
gonna talk about quite a few others and

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,979
why you would use a builder so I

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,210
actually have been a website designer

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:12,530
for about 18 years

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:14,829
thank you and I love it I grew up doing

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,509
this and I just love everything about

00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:19,429
WordPress what design websites helping

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,409
people discover who they really are and

00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:24,560
putting that kind of like on paper in a

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,570
website and I love solving people's

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,509
problems and when I started with

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,060
WordPress I felt like I was well I was

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,710
coming from coding in notepad so that

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,939
was a pain and then I start with

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,920
WordPress thinking oh my gosh this is

00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,630
amazing well as I started to do more and

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,299
more WordPress sites I started to see

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,640
that I had to pick a theme that worked

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,439
with the client and worked with their

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,179
industry well it looked good for them

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,749
and then I would have to learn that

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:52,520
theme over and over and over it was like

00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:54,020
starting a new job every time I got a

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,329
new client that needed a different theme

00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,130
than what I already worked with and then

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:00,289
I started trying to put clients into one

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,109
theme like picking a really good solid

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,459
base of a theme and I used blue chic

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,439
themes for quite a while I actually

00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,630
mentioned them yesterday and they're

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,970
really good base theme their feminine

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,640
driven did you change the colors you

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,170
can't tell and I really was like okay

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,390
I'm gonna put you guys all in blue chic

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,400
themes learn them really well and then I

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,360
found site Orange

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,030
builder which we're gonna talk about

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,159
then I put that on top of blue chic and

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,439
I was like this is amazing I can

00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,720
duplicate things I can go faster and

00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,459
then I found out that there were other

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
builders like beaver builder and Divi

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,069
and things like that so my journey to go

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,379
from straight WordPress working in you

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,329
know the regular editor to using a type

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,420
of builder that's on top of a theme or

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,430
that is an actual theme as a builder

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,049
really allowed me to increase all the

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,359
productivity that I was doing because I

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:52,269
didn't have to relearn it every single

00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,620
time that I tried a new theme and I also

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,790
didn't have to spend time looking for a

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,530
theme how many of you have spent hours

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:02,650
looking at your themes

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:03,849
it's a nightmare it's awful okay so we

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,510
don't want to waste our time or our

00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:09,670
money sometimes themes don't even have

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,340
you know like you can't even demo it

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,629
like you can see it but you can't play

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,980
with it how do I know that those

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,420
controls are gonna be good to work with

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,760
how do I know I can get to the things I

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,709
need to get to how do I know you know as

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,720
a like a let's say a non coder if I hand

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,639
this off to a client how are they gonna

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,799
be able to manage it and edit it when I

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,120
can't even find stuff in it so it's

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,099
sometimes you have to kind of buy it

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,650
before you try it and I feel like that's

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,459
silly with a lot of the themes so a lot

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,049
of the ones I'm going to show you today

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,549
actually have demos and I'm gonna put

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:41,739
those links in the chat for you guys so

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,690
I looked up those stats before I left

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,340
and this is what it told me so I don't

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,549
fit seeing it that 19% of the web is run

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,430
on WordPress and that's a lot of work

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,379
can't people and if you have if you know

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,669
this is your first word camp welcome

00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,489
we're so glad you're here you'll be

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,199
addicted don't worry but that's a lot of

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,609
people that are running WordPress and

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,560
that means there's a lot of opportunity

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,940
for people to build themes but at the

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,449
same time it's a lot of opportunity for

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,250
bad themes and just crappy themes that

00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:14,379
just don't work and that can really

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,859
confuse you when you're trying to find

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,859
something

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:26,350
so the reason I really like the builders

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:29,440
is because it's a theme and plugins and

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,090
all the builders all in one piece so the

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,030
theme you have controls some of your

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,620
functionality typically and it might

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,260
contain a builder with it but it

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,300
controls pretty much your visual aspects

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,250
of your site your plugins are really

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,900
your functionality piece they're what

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,450
make things happen they're the pieces

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,330
that are gonna lock together to make a

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,880
website functional in a full sense and

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,010
sometimes a builder can be just a plugin

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,800
which is that functionality piece but

00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,010
when you have a theme that is a builder

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
you get all of that in one piece and you

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,980
don't have to go hunting around for a

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,650
plugin that does this or a plugin that

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,660
does that yesterday I mentioned

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,820
duplicate post and duplicate page those

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,050
are two plugins that I like to use when

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,480
you're using certain themes that don't

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,030
let you duplicate things with a builder

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,820
typically most of them you can duplicate

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,650
any page or any post you want even save

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,590
it as a template for later and then use

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,700
it again and just edit it change it

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,460
whatever so then you don't even need

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,910
those two plugins you have this is

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,490
already doing it for you if you have any

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,780
questions just stop me and we'll answer

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:40,000
questions so a builder saved me 30% in

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,170
design time because all my tools are

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,870
right there I didn't have to go out

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:47,290
hunting for them and when I was editing

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,270
and just redesigning things 50% of the

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,250
time was saved because I'm not going

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,590
back going ok now the client wants me to

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,750
do X how in the world do I do that

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,350
another thing about builders is they

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,170
have a huge community behind them they

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,850
are driven by community because people

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,740
kind of glom on to them and then they

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,360
bring their friends and they bring their

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,030
friends and it's like a wonderful

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,260
pyramid scheme of builders and so then

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,670
you have all these people that have done

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,050
all this cool stuff with the Builder

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,390
that you might not have even thought

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,370
possible and I know yesterday in the 201

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,330
class s the second portion of the day he

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,800
was talking about how to write your own

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,060
plugins and how to do it really quick

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,010
with the code you might pull from

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,410
somewhere else well a lot of the times

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,060
with a builder you're using CSS and that

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,760
can be really complicated to write if

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,529
you're not familiar with it so one of

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,299
the people that I follow is Gino

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,909
he actually is one of the divi kind of

00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:39,519
top divvy people and he will do he does

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,289
a blog and he will just go through and

00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,689
say hey do you want to change one of

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,599
your menu items to a button here's the

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,789
CSS code and then you can basically use

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,129
it and tweak it and learn from it and he

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,199
actually did a code set that had the

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:56,139
wrong padding the button was like

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,629
off-centered and I was like gee now so I

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,189
fixed it for myself and then say nope my

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,689
notepad because I wanted to make sure I

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:03,999
had the good code but it was one of

00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,859
those things that you know he did it for

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,929
me and then I used it and I tweaked it

00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,729
and I use it all the time now on many

00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:12,129
different in many different areas of the

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,539
website so there's the Builder will

00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,399
really save you time because all these

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,449
people have done this for these builders

00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,459
they've learned them really well or

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,989
they've adjusted them and you could just

00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:22,179
go out and google it and find it like

00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,439
almost immediately and it's simple code

00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:25,329
it's not necessarily like you're trying

00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,589
to do a function or anything you don't

00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,749
have to write a function you're really

00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:31,869
more using CSS to manipulate it to

00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:33,339
adjust it so it's a little bit simpler

00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:37,539
when you're looking at a design from a

00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:39,839
design perspective builders can be

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,339
anywhere from free to a lot of money and

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:46,389
some of them have lifetime subscriptions

00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:48,069
if you try a demo of one and you like it

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,169
and you think I could use this this

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,079
could work for me just by the lifetime

00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,939
just do it because I actually didn't

00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,069
have a Divi demo before I purchased it

00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,919
there wasn't one out there when I bought

00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:02,679
it and I actually just bought it sight

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,989
unseen lifetime and they even say on

00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:07,719
their website we don't refund you I was

00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:11,439
like really scared but I did it anyway

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:13,689
and I let it sit in my in my files for

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,949
like two three weeks I was too scared to

00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:16,269
touch it I didn't know it's like well I

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,399
got it now I can't do anything you know

00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,929
I gotta use it or not but I started

00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,629
using on the next client site that I was

00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:24,039
building and it was a learning curve had

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,419
to learn that one too right but that's

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,089
what I was always doing relearning a

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,249
theme relearning a theme and once I

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,869
actually got into it and I started

00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,759
moving things around and then the second

00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:35,079
site I built oh my gosh it was so much

00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,699
faster I was like well I really like

00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,469
this piece that I used on the other site

00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,829
I'm gonna bring that over and change the

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,120
colors and change the font or whatever

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:45,160
or I'm gonna use it at the bottom of a

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,070
page instead of in a column or whatnot

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,320
and it really allowed me to say a client

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,290
to say hey I saw a website you did and I

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,450
really liked how this looked or how this

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,660
functioned I could go back to that site

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,120
pull down the piece I needed go to my

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,760
new site upload it tweak it now I'm done

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,530
I'm not redoing the whole thing have you

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,240
ever had something you've been working

00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,550
with let's say it's a form you're

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,280
filling out and it doesn't let you

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,890
autofill how many people think that's

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,320
annoying where you're like typing it in

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,150
and then you have to fill it out again

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,800
sometimes word camps use the same form

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,240
and they don't do like pay per call or

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,890
something and they're like fill this

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
form in 20 times for how many ever times

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,050
you want to you know submit a talk and

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,240
it doesn't autofill it's the worst it

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,310
makes it so frustrating but this is like

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,320
autofill for a website you've already

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,880
built it you've already done it you just

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,180
bring it over change the things that

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,680
need to be changed and use them again

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,080
the other thing about the lifetime ones

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,070
are they're unlimited uses typically so

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
you have to look at the licensing

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,840
agreements but with Divi I'm able to

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,390
pass it on to clients as I work with

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,860
them and because I'm paying for the

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,330
lifetime subscription there's licensing

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,130
things about that you could also get it

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,260
yearly you can pay you know with things

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,740
like 89 or so dollars a year I'd be a

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,330
hundred but you can basically know that

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,860
when you put a client on something like

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,080
beaver builder or Divi or whatnot and

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,030
they go away from you for some reason

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,520
which I like to release clients I don't

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,930
like to hold them hostage then you know

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,910
that there's this community that can

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,530
support them out there you're not just

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,970
letting them go and just be like alright

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,710
see a good luck with that site I built

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,450
you because it's all custom and have fun

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,310
you know it's something that they can go

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,900
out and say hey I'm gonna go into this

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,700
Facebook community or I'm gonna go to a

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,930
WordPress community and I'm going to say

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,060
hey does anybody know how to use this

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,430
and like ten people are gonna know so it

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,810
really gives me you know more peace of

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,030
mind that I'm when I build something for

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,700
a client in a builder I'm giving them a

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,840
little bit more of a head start because

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,280
they're still not gonna be able to build

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,530
it from scratch like they're not gonna

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,180
know all that stuff but I'm at least

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,620
gonna be able to give them kind of a

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,610
head start in that where it's gonna be a

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,770
little easier for them going forward and

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,600
I I really love working with builders

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,820
and so once you go and you kind of take

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,020
the step to the dark side on that then

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,340
you'll really I think you'll

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,720
find that it's a lot better than maybe

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,630
the process you've been using in the

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,670
past now some people really like beaver

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,160
builder and I find that more developers

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,980
like be rivet or better because it's

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,600
more expandable it's not heavy with code

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,610
like they have all these terms they like

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,040
to use and that's fine but you have to

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,470
find the Builder that works for you Divi

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,880
is more of a designers builder it's more

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,440
about the pretty things and this the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,810
waves in the short cut pieces you can

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,400
use and the icons and all that stuff and

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,190
how easy it is to change this and that

00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,630
and so really looking at them all and

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,790
trying them all like I said with these

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,860
demos it's gonna give you that sense of

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,620
what works for me because when I say

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,880
Divi and I'm like you should use Divi it

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,350
doesn't mean it's gonna work for you as

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
well so you need to try all the ones

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,660
that I'm recommending and even other

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,750
ones that are out there because these

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,110
aren't all of them so there are elements

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:56,200
of a builder I like that there's grid

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,670
elements there's blog elements when

00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,830
you're looking at them evaluate the

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,610
pieces you use all the time for clients

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,440
I use the blogging elements a lot I like

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,630
that I can download pieces of Divi and

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,180
re-upload them somewhere else a lot of

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,040
the builders do that and then like this

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,760
one has like a chart thing in the number

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,320
counter I like that also this one has

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,840
like background video and stuff like

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,660
that initially most builders didn't do

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,860
that but now most of them do so that's

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,410
you know an element that I really liked

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,240
about Divi when I first started using it

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,970
Divi has a drag-and-drop editor most of

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,460
them do they also have a visual editor

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,780
most of them do so keep those things in

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,490
mind as you start to play with with

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,770
different ones and look through

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:44,350
different demos there's time consuming

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:47,710
functionality that can be done custom

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,130
coded that Divi does automatically by

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:54,010
itself I love using background video in

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,660
my headers and then what about mobile

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,980
though it's gonna be harder on mobile to

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,590
have a background video it's gonna load

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,700
slower and so what I've done with Divi

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,620
which I really like and i think the

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,470
other builder does as well is that you

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,630
can basically say on desktop show this

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,850
on mobile show these so you're really

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,360
customizing it based on what's going to

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,190
work best whereas if you're just Bill

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,410
like straight responsive and you're not

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,450
doing a lot of custom coding you

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,060
basically say here's my photo and then

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,190
the you know the responsive code we

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,790
resizes at whichever way you might get

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,440
this of a woman you go on a page and on

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,899
the website it looks like this but then

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,459
she's like this and that's not great you

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,140
know you want her face in the center or

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,000
whatever and you can really adjust that

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,260
on Divi you can also adjust the size of

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,690
the photo or even have a totally

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,029
different photo then your header is on

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,860
your main page on the desktop versus

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,740
what you see on a you know tablet versus

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,360
what you see on a phone so I like that

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,980
about the builders is that you have more

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,420
flexibility when it comes to responsive

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,980
design because I know you guys have

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,839
probably been to a website or even built

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,000
a website where it looks great on the

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,140
computer on your screen and then you get

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,360
to another screen you're like crap now

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,950
chill fix it cause it's all messed up or

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,779
it looks funny or the clients like why

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,490
is my face cut off why is my hair cut

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,019
off you know stuff like that so you can

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,519
really just go in and resize the photo

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,260
exactly the way you need it and say only

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,510
show this on mobile only show this on

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,850
tablet or only show this all i you know

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,690
desktop so I love that about the

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,920
builders it's those kind of

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,440
functionality that would take you more

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,480
time and CSS coding normally to do all

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,630
that responsive stuff it's done kind of

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,540
automatically they also have a lot of

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,279
third-party integrations there's a lot

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,140
of social media platforms that integrate

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,850
they have you know like instead of

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,070
getting an Instagram display plug-in

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,019
some of them have Instagram display

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,060
widgets that are just built into the

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,110
theme built into the Builder and you

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,570
don't have to go out and find these

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,490
extra plugins that may break that may

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,740
Instagram may say oh we're not doing

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,320
that kind of API anymore usually the

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,510
paid builders they're on top of that

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,579
stuff they have hundreds and hundreds of

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,680
thousands of users and they can't have

00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,300
their Instagram breaking as part

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
of their theme that means the theme is

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,180
broken that means someone's gonna say

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,829
well forget this I'm moving to a

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,300
different one so they have to really be

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,550
on top of that and I find that the paid

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,170
ones are a little more kind of paying

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,730
attention to those things ahead of time

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,600
whereas some of the plug-in builders

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,449
they're just building it for themselves

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,310
and they may not update it for years it

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,839
may break they have a lot of mail

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,550
services that are integrated so their

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,410
mail blocks are already done you don't

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,270
have to go get code from your mail you

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,279
know MailChimp or whatever and bring it

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,740
in and then paste it in and then make

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,370
sure it's responsive and all that a lot

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,199
of times

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,149
they'll have a block that just says sign

00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,589
in to your MailChimp account which wish

00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,230
list do you want to send this to and

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,879
it's done it's integrated and divvy

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,379
specifically works really well with who

00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,730
commerce I really like the way that it

00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,589
looks even just kind of out of the box

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,480
you only have to do much with it

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,730
the Cart button appears and everything

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,439
so you know when you have Divi or when

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,720
you have WooCommerce you're trying to

00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:50,519
find a theme that fits WooCommerce maybe

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,899
it has to be a WooCommerce theme and

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,639
then you have to kind of sort through

00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,220
all those then they're really shop

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,439
centric with this with builders you can

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,509
actually do a great blog a great

00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:03,029
ecommerce store and a great website all

00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,529
in one without having to find a theme

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:09,439
that only really caters to one or the

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:14,189
other questions

00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:16,319
no okay it must be doing a great job you

00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:18,809
can also create landing pages with Divi

00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:21,389
which I really like

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,189
so let me um let me pull this over here

00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:27,660
so I'm gonna look at this for a minute

00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:29,850
and this landing page I did for a

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,670
website that I was doing it was actually

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,679
a group that I had started and

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:38,850
Jacksonville networking guide do you see

00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:42,899
any headers on that like any menus no

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,509
menus it's in my website it's in a Divi

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,069
built website but Divi has an option and

00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,470
a lot of the builders do that says

00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,800
remove the header and footer I don't see

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,689
them

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,309
you know those lock pages I don't really

00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:55,470
like landing pages because it's like I

00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:58,319
got you you can't go anywhere now you

00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,939
have to use the back button but in this

00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,589
case I wanted to send people here just

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,029
to this page as Elizabeth campulung

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,079
Concord slash you know Jacksonville

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,880
Landing or you know whatever

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,770
Jacksonville networking guy and so I

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,970
wanted to send them just to that page

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,069
but I didn't want it to look like my

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,439
website and a lot of the builders let

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,929
you kind of strip away the website nest

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,850
of your website and really build a true

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:21,179
landing page and this was a really long

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,010
sales page as well so you know had lots

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,600
of elements and had you know the

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,000
testimonials and those this you know

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,649
sale buttons and all that stuff but it

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,330
was that way that you could just say I

00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:33,149
don't need another product I don't need

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,710
another plugin my builder does this for

00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:38,300
me and all I have to do is say you know

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,760
how there's no footers and it just works

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,300
and if anybody wants to know this photo

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:48,430
is actually a website that I use let me

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:51,970
show you guys I use this for all of my

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,970
portfolio stuff

00:17:52,180 --> 00:18:00,020
it's called M am i dot responsive design

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,160
is and I love it because it's got all

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:06,170
these little elements so it's got all

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:12,560
your pieces and go to this website and

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:14,240
see what it looks like so it shows you

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,640
what it looks like on all of the

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,470
different sizes and then so for my

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,270
portfolio typically I just like to see a

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,430
desktop and a mobile I don't really need

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,100
to see the other two pieces so what I do

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:29,420
is I swipe these out just drag them off

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,060
I move my phone over here and then I do

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,930
this nice little feature and I just take

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,750
a photo of it

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:43,010
and that's for my portfolio now this is

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,590
my portfolio page right here do you

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,420
think I stick that my own website and

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,070
it's done I don't have to screenshot

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,630
anything I have to go home like fine

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,850
just you know screenshot or whatever I

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,020
just do this and then everybody's like

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,310
oh I can see what it looks like on

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,650
desktop I can see what looks like a

00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,150
mobile and then I can send them a link

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,320
to this you know this link could be this

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,510
photo can be linked to the site so they

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,220
can actually see it or whatever but

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,740
that's how I do the portfolio shots it's

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,460
just a real quick easy way just want to

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,150
show that with you guys really quick but

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,990
yeah these are pretty cool way of

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:20,390
setting that up so if you like this look

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,190
that's how I do it but it's a my

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,490
responsive done actually let me just put

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:32,090
it in the chat for you guys be way

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:35,480
easier alright okay so that's that let's

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,590
go to the next part here we're going to

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,940
look at a couple of the builders these

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,070
are the ones I'm going to go through I

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,360
might not get to all of them so I have

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,610
the slides for you guys I don't have the

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,030
links we're gonna start with beaver

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,030
builder

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:59,809
so this is the beaver builder demo I'm

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:02,059
hoping all of these work correctly so

00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,070
this is kind of a back end of what

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,750
beaver builder looks like and if your if

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,460
your beaver builder user it might not be

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,880
exact because like I said this is a demo

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,860
so I have some limited features and I'm

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,120
not as familiar with it as I should be

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,159
probably because I don't use it all the

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,380
time I used to be the most of the time

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,500
but you can see how easy it is to edit

00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,200
this if you want to so I can just come

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,380
in here I can double click it and I get

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:32,419
this menu or I can actually just click

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:37,220
on it and you know put whatever I want

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:38,960
in there and save it I can also move it

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,880
around I can go back into this little

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,409
thing and change the style maybe I want

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,470
this to be red and maybe I have a color

00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:59,630
code that I want to use so let me look

00:20:48,470 --> 00:21:04,029
up gold and I've got this gold right

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:08,289
here so I'm put that in so now it's gold

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:15,260
and then see what else we got

00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:16,880
got my font so I can change this choose

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,510
my size so you can see it's really

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,789
really simple to change this you know

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,769
just by going in here just looking all

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,880
the options it's not you know rocket

00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,960
science really that's why I like the

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,360
builders because it just gives me all

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,730
the options you know I don't really do

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,600
anything to learn this I can kind of its

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,380
intuitive enough let's pick a different

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,919
font here we go and I don't like this

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,240
color so I'm going back to black so does

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,980
that make sense three guys like it's

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,529
this is beaver builder specifically this

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,480
is their front-end development and then

00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,710
of course you've got your save I can add

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,240
different elements these are all my

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,040
blocks I've got different columns I can

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,429
use

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,950
I've got rose I can add different

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,480
columns I've got some templates I could

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,270
just add a whole template if I needed to

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,160
and then if there's any saved stuff like

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:12,929
I've saved a row that I like like this

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,770
sliding you know think for like

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:18,460
testimonials I really like this row I

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:23,799
can save this row show you that pretty

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,150
shirts save as and I'm going to say it's

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,140
not a global one you don't want to save

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,730
it as global unless you want it to be

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,190
the same on every single time you use it

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,450
kind of makes it like I'm going to save

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,540
it and then I'm if I change it it

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:38,110
changes everywhere I've used it I'm

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:41,799
gonna save this and if I go in here

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:44,110
I've got Row 1 and I can drag him in and

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,669
now I've got two of them let's see how

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,070
easy that is like if I make something

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:49,960
and I like it I can save it and use it

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,650
again and again and again now global

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,820
stuff I like to use global for stuff

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,580
like this

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,230
this is my footer I'm not going to

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,150
change that I want it to be the same on

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,400
every single one if I change the address

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,130
I want it to change on every single page

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,140
without it being in a footer area like

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:13,390
in the dashboard right so I can

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:17,500
essentially save this as a row I'll say

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,390
footer and I can save it as global so

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,270
that every time I use it it puts the

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,950
same piece in and if I change one piece

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,720
if I change the address if I change the

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,360
logo if I add different link to my

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,440
social every single time I've used that

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,220
across my site it will change

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,049
automatically

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,020
because it's global it means it's once

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:39,280
and done right so that's beaver builder

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,410
what do you guys think okay right pretty

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,610
good like I said it works for some works

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,820
better for some people and though it's

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:49,570
good for others just depends let's go

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:54,570
ahead and look at themify um this is a

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:57,520
video I'm actually just going to pull up

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:00,630
the link and I'm going to put this in a

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,630
chat for you guys too

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:14,060
here we go this one is just the let me

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:16,220
go back here and get the video they

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,510
didn't have a demo for me maybe I just

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:24,280
didn't find it but they I couldn't find

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:24,280
theirs and here's the link for the video

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,690
so we'll just watch a little bit of this

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,860
so you guys can see what looks like so

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,450
they're working on this right here

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,370
they're looking at if they're gonna do

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:42,050
some different transitions and

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,180
animations on it scroll speed visibility

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,980
like here's again desktop tablet mobile

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:52,190
there's choosing which one they want to

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:53,960
show on and again these boxes are pop

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,370
ups this is very much you know pretty

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,560
much a standard across a lot of the

00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,940
builders you get these pop-up boxes so

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,230
you can see what you're doing but then

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,020
they go away and you can see your whole

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,820
design again which I like and they

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,830
integrate with the WordPress pieces like

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,260
the the media library and stuff like

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:16,390
that

00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:18,500
alright let's go out of this alright

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,210
this one I would recommend watching the

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,470
video it's about ten minutes if you're

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,120
interested in the theme of five builders

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,520
anybody you've seen if I know you said

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,290
you did you do okay and talk to these

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,060
guys because they use it so talk to

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,650
somebody who uses it on a regular basis

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,480
ask them what they like about it what

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,890
they don't like about it and then talk

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,120
to other people about the other ones

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,430
and ask them what they like about it

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,170
what they don't and see where those pros

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,910
and cons fit cuz some of the cons for

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,680
someone else you could be like that's

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,850
not a big deal I don't use that or no I

00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,470
can live with that

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,880
so it just depends on you know what

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,350
you're looking for and how you're gonna

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,350
use it what kind of clients you have

00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:58,060
okay let's go through next one here

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,160
yeah

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:10,559
oh yeah in the chat um

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:13,769
this is Elizabeth Pam pallone comm

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,330
forward slash word camp and I'm just

00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:17,070
putting the links in there so you guys

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:22,440
can go back to them or if you want to

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:31,100
look at them now and I'm just showing

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:32,490
you these little demos so this is the

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:39,690
here

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:44,789
make me do this every time I did this

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,440
the other day yep okay let me go back to

00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:47,580
my i'ma do it I'm gonna have to skip

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,610
this one I may have to skip to the next

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,889
one it's only got so much time okay

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:57,649
how much time do I have left timekeepers

00:26:54,889 --> 00:27:00,990
drive 20

00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:02,669
thank you for said no all right so I'll

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,289
come back to that one if I need to but

00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:09,240
we'll look at this one first I've got

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:16,399
like three more all right let's look at

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:20,990
this one don't you just love live stuff

00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:20,990
put this in the chat for you guys oh

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,970
this one that's right this one doesn't

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,769
have one either but this is an image

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,169
that I found of this specific builders

00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:32,490
this is live composer and they're doing

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,049
the same kind of thing now where they

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,100
have those modules and they have the

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:39,840
drag-and-drop and then I like that they

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,580
have this bottom bar where it's kind of

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,950
like always there and you can add

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,330
different pieces that you use often like

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,639
it's kind of like your most recent

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,690
blocks that you've used it's a little

00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,769
different than some of the other ones

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,750
but this one actually is them designing

00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,909
for specifically mobile and so like I

00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,929
said you have those mobile pieces and I

00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,029
don't think you should ever really

00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,830
design separate pieces for each of them

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,809
but you should at least have it in mind

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,580
that you're paying attention to each

00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,350
piece as you design so you're not

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,750
getting into something where you're like

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,490
okay now you know I've built this great

00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,879
site but it looks horrible on mobile or

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,110
it's all cut off or whatever and what he

00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,830
talked about in the keynote about like

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,780
accessible

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,150
paying attention to the spacing on

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,940
mobile and stuff like that more white

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,770
space you have I feel like the better

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,020
even if I have to scroll more it's fine

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,200
I want bigger buttons on mobile I want

00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,750
clearer things double columns on mobile

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,310
is almost like Y like if my phone is

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,430
small enough already I don't need two

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:40,050
columns of stuff so that kind of stuff

00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,640
those kind of design elements you have

00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,130
to just pay more attention to when

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,410
you're designing for desktop it's fine

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,060
three four columns across even six but

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,290
when you go to mobile or tablet you have

00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,280
to really kind of look back at what

00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,160
you're doing and make sure that the

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,480
responsiveness is happening properly the

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,970
other thing I like about builders is

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,620
when you do columns on desktop sometimes

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,080
you can go in depending on the builder

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,500
and you can actually say this column is

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,180
first this column is second so that the

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,460
mobile responsive will actually put it

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,440
in the correct order sometimes you have

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,480
a picture like I like to do this the

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,850
staggered pictures so I have like text

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,890
picture picture text like so they're

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,860
staggered right but then on mobile you

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,660
want it to be picture text picture text

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,610
otherwise you have picture text text

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,930
picture and it looks funny it's like

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,180
wait where'd the other picture go and

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,680
it's at the bottom then you have another

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,990
picture next to it so it kind of makes

00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,850
it uneven it doesn't look right and so

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,130
in builders you can actually say this

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,990
picture is first this text is second

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,180
this picture is third this text is

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,860
fourth but on your computer looking at

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,050
your desktop version you get that same

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,880
staggered look you're just putting an

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,750
order to them so that doesn't look weird

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,750
on mobile yes

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,760
it will not automatically fix it on the

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,400
on some of the builders it gives them a

00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,590
signed random number it will put it in

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,040
the order that it thinks I should go in

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,930
so you're basically saying it's not

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,160
necessarily numbers per se sound like 1

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:14,220
2 3 it's more you know this should come

00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,480
before the next element like the picture

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,340
and the text you're saying this one's

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,770
first this one's second and then the

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,180
next row or the next you know area

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,640
this one's first this one's second so

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,590
it's more per like row I guess and in

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,050
that case I would have separate rows

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,730
just so that they flow properly rather

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,260
than if it's on the left it's gonna be

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,520
second I mean if something right it's

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,200
gonna be second if it's on the left it's

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,340
gonna be first so it just depends on the

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,770
other reading left to right kind of

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,110
thing so but you have to play with that

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,700
a little bit to see but when I've done

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,770
it I always do it in separate rows and

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,210
so then they the rows are in order but

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,150
the picture and the text which one's

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:54,150
first may not be in order so that's what

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:56,190
you need to fix on that all right this

00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,690
is the one I really like I'm going to

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,390
show this little video I couldn't find

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,920
the demo on it but I haven't used this

00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,900
one in a while but I know that they've

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,550
been keeping up with it really well so

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,290
ever since I got Divi I haven't I

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,290
haven't used it as much but

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:23,090
let's do this guys can see it this is

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,430
what you can put on top of most themes

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,960
so it's actually really easy to add to

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,010
WordPress you don't know really matter

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,410
what theme you're using that's why I

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:33,450
used it with blue chic because they had

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,790
a really great style and elements that I

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,560
liked they get great layouts and great

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,700
templates but this really made me

00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,700
allowed me to take those templates

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,490
further this is the back end it does

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,230
have a live editor now but I love the

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,630
grid I love that all the blocks are

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,460
named they don't have a lot of blocks

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,400
that are different colors and whatnot

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,990
but you know like Divi does but their

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,490
weight and the ease of use of this it's

00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,680
kind of like if you haven't ever used a

00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,430
builder throw this into your site it's

00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,200
just a plugin

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,850
play with it a little bit with the

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,100
current site you have on a you know

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,720
separate page on a draft page and this

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,700
will kind of get you used to that block

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,040
style but it's very easy and user

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,410
friendly I feel like so it's kind of

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,970
like my little starter builder but if

00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,210
you like things that are a little bit

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,160
more you know WordPress standard or like

00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,360
look more like WordPress there rather

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,370
than their own deal

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,220
this really integrates with WordPress

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:28,050
really well and it doesn't feel like

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,760
you're going outside of the norm and say

00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,830
I'm using this really big builder that's

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,060
taking over everything this is kind of

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,150
like let me add this little builder on

00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,650
the side and try it out they have a lot

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,150
of widgets and stuff that come with the

00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,830
Builder which is really cool and again

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,740
all these things are stuff that you

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:46,560
would normally be paying you know or

00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,000
getting extra plugins for and you might

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,890
find a bad plug-in or plugin that

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,600
doesn't work with your theme and this is

00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,910
something that you can really you know

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,370
use sparingly or as much as you want and

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,500
it usually works with much themes here's

00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:01,440
the code for these which I like to their

00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,660
code is very simple it doesn't overload

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,850
it's not as heavy as Divi is it does

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,390
less but it's not as it's not as heavy I

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:12,180
also love their their little column

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,160
thing I use this so so much it allows

00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,050
you to drag the columns width wise

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,030
Divi actually doesn't let you do that so

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:20,850
it's a little surprising but this

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,500
specific one does so if you want a

00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:27,390
little flexibility with that it's pretty

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,590
awesome all right anybody pick one yet

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:37,100
but they want to try and

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:37,100
might try out later alright my favorite

00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:46,049
gonna run some divvy and this one

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,700
actually is a Aspen Grove so I was gonna

00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:49,740
demo it on one of my sites and I thought

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,820
no cuz then you guys can't see it like

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,860
you wouldn't be able to go to it later

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,889
so I found a DVD me which I thought was

00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,659
pretty cool and I've got an affiliate

00:33:55,889 --> 00:34:01,409
link for if you want to buy diffic

00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:03,419
awesome all right so here's we're gonna

00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:05,279
look at one of these and these are some

00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:09,599
of the templates that you can do you can

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:13,500
actually demo so there's lots of them in

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,659
here let's see I really liked this one

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,839
the other day so we're gonna look at

00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,839
this

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:32,309
what oh my gosh okay let's try this on

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,179
of course

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,349
all right well we tried

00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:47,919
let's see if this works hi I'm a member

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:51,940
silly okay let's look let's login maybe

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:58,230
that'll help it's not out of selling my

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,230
pet peeve all right now let's go back

00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,630
it's thinking really hard I think it's

00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:10,660
working yeah it's working all right

00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:13,450
okay so this is demo 11 let's look at

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:24,550
the front end so we can see what this

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:25,570
page actually looks like come on guy all

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,820
right let me close all these windows

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:33,150
that don't aren't unnecessary hold on as

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:37,720
I go oh okay so this is what the

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,890
template looks like I really like it I

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,680
like their use of color

00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,920
I like their use of this transparency on

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,630
the photo they've used it again here and

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,020
he actually slid in a second ago as I

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,270
was scrolling I like the full width grid

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,620
that they use here so everything's

00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,020
there's no you know padding or anything

00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,370
there I like the numbers so just a lot

00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,470
of the little pieces of Divi that are

00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:02,020
really cute and work really well for

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,840
different things I have a client that

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,210
does they're a non-profit and they have

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,440
like work with them women and like

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,970
pregnancy and stuff like that and they

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,290
give away diapers and so that we have a

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,360
counter for how many diapers they've

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,980
given away so kind of funny it's like

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,180
it's like in the hundreds of thousands

00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,500
just keeps counting and counting

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:22,600
counting all right so let's look and you

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,370
can see also cool things like you know

00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,660
the menu disappears as you scroll if you

00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,540
get to the top and then as you scroll

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:31,060
down it reappears so we're gonna look at

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,750
the editing this page now we're gonna

00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:37,330
look at this as the the grid view on how

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,890
to edit this page on a grid side which I

00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,830
like to use this sometimes when I need

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,990
to get to one specific item one specific

00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:49,420
area so that you're not having to hunt

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:51,820
for it on the visual builder so these

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,310
are all the pieces that we just saw but

00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,020
this is the back end of it everything's

00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,390
very laid out like I said really

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,570
straight grid they have full width they

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,860
have standard these are rows and then

00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,070
you've got your columns within your rows

00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:09,460
and you have fancy columns and rows

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:12,810
which are these a little bit more fancy

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:15,930
than what we are using currently in here

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:25,140
so let's go to the visual builder and

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:27,960
I'll show you some of that again we've

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,750
got these little hover buttons like

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,420
moving it around editing it duplicating

00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,460
it saving it and trashing it so got that

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,140
kind of stuff I can add another row here

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,140
if I need to or another module within

00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:44,810
that row everything is color-coded which

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:47,640
does help so the rows are blue and the

00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,830
actual columns are green and then the

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,580
modules are this gray so everything is

00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:55,710
kind of nested within itself these this

00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,550
is one column but if we look at the

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:02,790
padding on this I but its astronomical

00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:04,560
yep 157 and so that's really what's

00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,240
giving it that centered look without

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,450
having two columns on the side that are

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,920
empty which sometimes can lead to weird

00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,710
things on mobile with it being like

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,780
having like extra empty space if you

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,750
equalize columns you can do that in here

00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,210
so it also gives us we've got this as a

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,970
second row so here this is one row

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:26,220
screen I maybe say what yeah one row and

00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,920
then here we've got another row that's

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:31,890
green it's wider this blue is actually

00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,020
the section so we've got section row and

00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:38,850
then module so I mess it up first side

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,680
and here we've got a module that's this

00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,120
number two we've got a module that says

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,330
projects and we got a module that's the

00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,330
text and then another one that is his

00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:51,060
picture and then there's you know no

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,310
padding here or no spacing here that's

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,620
probably set to 0 or minus so that it

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,380
can be below this this section that's

00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,690
coming next and then these are set to

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,580
two columns with you no no no padding

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,440
those sections are no spacing in between

00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,180
so there's a lot of little things like

00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,200
that you can do with it so let me look

00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,460
at this real quick I'll show you here

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,180
it's set to zero so that you have that

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:19,530
full bleed and then in the actual module

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:23,750
itself this is a call to action module

00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:26,060
with a title a text and then a button

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:29,710
and you can see you can change your

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,119
links here you can change the background

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,690
I've got all these settings I can change

00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,880
what the button looks like I can add in

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,300
the background to my button like the

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:44,570
color could be a bit of an image I can

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:49,310
add a video I can do gradients

00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:51,680
I've got icons I can use you see if my

00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:56,470
button has an icon on hover it does this

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,960
little arrow I want it to be a heart

00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:02,390
that's a heart see how it's like quick

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,160
and easy that is sometimes when you get

00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,070
a theme and it has these elements in it

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,190
it actually will be really like limited

00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:12,050
so you won't have font awesome icons in

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,490
there you're gonna have like 8 icons

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,170
these are the icons you can use the

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,510
icons we like to use or you can go get

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,380
your own icons and upload them and then

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,430
you have to make sure they're sized

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,890
correctly and they're the right color

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:24,790
and all that stuff this one is red

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:28,010
because it says button icon color and

00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:32,510
the default is red if I want it to be

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:34,550
black now it's black I mean I could put

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,770
my hex codes in there these colors right

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,140
here also these are the standard colors

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,150
for your brand and you set that in Divi

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,980
settings so you can put all the colors

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,740
that you're using for your whole site

00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,240
all those brand colors and you can set

00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,920
them up so that every time you go into

00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,300
this part of the Builder your brand

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,859
colors are they're not all these random

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,510
colors and you don't have to keep

00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:56,390
putting in hex codes over and over and

00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,830
over which is annoying like I said a lot

00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,570
of the builders have stuff like this

00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,980
it's just that when I started working

00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,480
with Divi it's just one of the ones that

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,400
I just gravitated towards and I've

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,410
gotten so used to it now it's pretty

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,089
much the only one I use now as a

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,700
business owner and as a website designer

00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:14,240
that does this for a living I make

00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:17,690
people go on site ground you have to use

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,070
Divi and I only give you one day those

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,410
are my 3 stipulations if you want to

00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,910
work with me now that's me I've gotten

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,320
really really specific and I've gotten

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,540
really specific about the clients that I

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,040
serve and this works for them it doesn't

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,420
work for everyone I've turned down

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,250
clients all the time and send them

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,540
elsewhere because they don't want to use

00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,450
Divi they don't want to be on site

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,310
ground I don't know why they don't want

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,960
to only do it in one day they

00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,600
me to take six weeks and build this

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,160
massive you know whatever site I know I

00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,010
can do these things but for a specific

00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,230
type of client and what really comes

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,570
down to is saving time and money and

00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,330
energy you know working on a site by

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:56,120
using a builder is really helpful but to

00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,980
get to using it the most effective is

00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,790
when you really hone in on that brand

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:03,140
and say this is who my people are this

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,060
is who they're going this is what

00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,950
they're going to attract - it doesn't

00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,630
even matter what the design is but it's

00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,400
like I know that I could give this to a

00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,200
client and they could figure it out

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,460
if I if they needed to think didn't have

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,380
the money anymore to paint here whatever

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,670
move to another country and they didn't

00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,290
you know want to connect still

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,720
communicate whatever it doesn't matter

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,060
clients need to be able to have the

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,860
ability to say I want my site back and

00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,960
you can say okay here it is and know

00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,150
that they're gonna be ok without that

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,040
overhanging thing of well what's really

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,900
really custom and who's your next

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,520
developer and worrying about them in a

00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,410
sense because that can also weigh on us

00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,450
I mean I'm one of those people that like

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,890
you said in the keynote I care probably

00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,680
too much it's my fault

00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,690
but like I want them to be okay if I

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,130
give this to them and another reason

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,530
using a builder is not only it saves me

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,380
time and me money but then when they get

00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,220
it they're like oh I feel empowered I

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,900
can do this

00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,190
and they know that they don't have time

00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,770
to do it and that's why they pay me to

00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,540
do it that's what I do all day but they

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,890
also know that if they needed to I'm

00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,810
setting them up for success in the

00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,000
future

00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,560
so what do you guys think of builders do

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,760
you think it's gonna save you time like

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,070
I know you can solve you're already

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,390
using them right but ever you think you

00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:16,090
might explore some different ones now

00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:22,960
maybe try some out there's lots of demos

00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:22,960
anybody have any questions yes

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,740
mm-hm

00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,830
mm-hmm

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,530
mm-hmm

00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,320
mm-hmm

00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,210
right

00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,890
mm-hmm

00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,580
right so so the question is to hand off

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,790
the client I'm doing this for the video

00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,410
stand off the client their own site but

00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,270
maybe teaching them a little and still

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,860
having them need you or do you teach

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,920
them everything in hand in the keys and

00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,080
that just come down to the client so I

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,090
love WordPress with all my heart like

00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,190
that's why I'm here I traveled here on

00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,170
my own dime I'm volunteering like I

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,020
really love WordPress but at the same

00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,040
time I've recognized the shift in the

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,270
market and I'm gonna get to your

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,250
question so don't feel like I'm rabbit

00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,040
trailing but but it's coming it's coming

00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,540
around but I've recognized a shift in

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,970
the market as well there's a lot of DIY

00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,620
errs who want a DIY there's a lot of

00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,940
small business owners and if you're

00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,290
serving small business owners raise your

00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,370
hand because I want to see like you're

00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,500
serving small small business like

00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:04,830
one-man shops you know two to five

00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,230
people maybe even those people are very

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,780
specific and very special they have two

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:12,540
different avenues as you've seen they

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,820
want to say I can do a little but I

00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,800
could mess it up and they know that and

00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,380
they need you but then there's the other

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,950
ones who are like I want to do this

00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,740
myself

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,960
I think they're entrepreneurs which and

00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,520
you guys are to some of you that's hard

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,990
you know that that's like you're like I

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,510
want to do it I'll pour the milk myself

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:32,730
I'm for I can do it you know like it's

00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:35,030
that idea and it's you have to be able

00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,530
to empower the ones you can empower and

00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,200
let the ones go that are just gonna make

00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,270
all the bad decisions and then keep the

00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,790
ones that are gonna have that reliable

00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,160
that vision and that value that says I

00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,020
feel like what you do is way more

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,920
important and way more valuable than the

00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:55,530
you know like I get paid for me to do

00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,970
certain pieces of that that's costing me

00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,930
more money than to pay someone 50

00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,510
dollars now we're gonna do the same

00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,220
thing for me to take that time that I

00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,050
can now work on my business and make

00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,480
more money right I do that with my house

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,580
cleaner so you know that's one of the

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,930
things that I try to do is that's why I

00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,180
do the in a days and I switch to that

00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,080
it's cuz I can say you know what at the

00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,330
end of this day you're gonna have a

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,550
website you're gonna know how to run it

00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,090
you're gonna see the every aspect of how

00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,530
it was built

00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,030
now this is me okay it's not for

00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,170
everybody you're gonna see every aspect

00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,270
of how it was built

00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,770
you're gonna know that thing inside and

00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:29,380
out do you know how to put a domain in

00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:32,170
maybe not do you know how to set up you

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,880
know email with email servers and G

00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,530
suite and all that it's pretty easy

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,150
right but they probably are gonna pay

00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,500
attention while I'm doing that but

00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,610
they're gonna know how to put text in

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,740
they're gonna know how to move pictures

00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,930
around they're gonna know how to add a

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,160
page how to make a post because I'm

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,230
gonna make them do all of that in that

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,480
day and then when we're done at the end

00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,250
of the day and even before we start the

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,920
process I say you know what

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,840
what is your lifestyle like what are you

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,800
gonna do with this site are you gonna go

00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,330
in here every month and test your

00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,590
contact form are you gonna go in here

00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,810
every month and check and make sure

00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,490
nothing is just weird because sometimes

00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,050
just code breaks are you gonna go in

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,030
every month and test your own email

00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,960
marketing form and put your address in

00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,850
and then go into your email marketing

00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,950
form and delete it loose you can do it

00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:13,840
again next month like are you gonna do

00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:15,580
those things are you gonna go in and

00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,320
update your content are you gonna go in

00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,000
and add your blog post and format them

00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,790
correctly and put all the right keywords

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,790
in are you gonna find a picture for

00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,440
every blog post you do is that part of

00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,840
the lifestyle you're gonna have and some

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,550
clients are like this is my life this is

00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,590
what I'm gonna do they're like you know

00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,970
bloggers are their life coaches or

00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,950
whatever and their life is pretty much

00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,570
on line so they're on their websites all

00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,460
the time anyway that's part of their

00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,440
life I teach them how to do it I send

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,670
them off I'm never gonna get them as a

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,780
client because they want to do it

00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,140
themselves they want to pour the milk

00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,910
right then there's the clients that say

00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:53,020
I'm not really tech savvy and I know

00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,580
that so what do you charge and when I

00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,260
say when they say they want me to help

00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,300
them and I'm like how long are you gonna

00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,040
do this is this a 3-year plan is this a

00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,600
five-year plan like we go into like

00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,340
business development because it does

00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,930
come down to that I don't wanna ever put

00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,060
someone in a site that's like WordPress

00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,440
when they're like I'm gonna manage it

00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,880
myself and I'm like do you know how to

00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,619
do an update have you ever had a site

00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,970
break do you know how to do a little bit

00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:14,350
of coding in case you need to do you

00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,619
know how to go into FTP and they're like

00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,450
uh then you need someone like me well I

00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:21,850
can't afford that then we're not gonna

00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,560
use WordPress I'm not gonna do it

00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:25,240
because I don't want to set them up to

00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,040
fail and that's something I've learned

00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,840
over the last 12 years and that's why

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,240
two years ago I switched my platform and

00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,380
my whole my whole business I just

00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,330
changed the entire business model

00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,100
because I thought I keep setting people

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,900
up to fail and I keep setting myself up

00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,150
to fail because then I feel bad like the

00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,720
client their business didn't do well or

00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,480
whatever because

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,010
their website wasn't serving them and so

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,030
some clients I put on Squarespace some

00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,010
clients they put on other platforms

00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,470
sometimes I put on Shopify some clients

00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:52,390
I put on WordPress it depends on the

00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,329
client and the lifestyle going forward

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,349
so really comes down to is the client

00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:58,810
gonna be able to manage it on their own

00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:01,119
do they have that ability internally and

00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,190
some of them say I've got it and then

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,510
you just start rattling off every month

00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,980
you got to do updates yes it can break

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,480
your site do you know how to fix it do

00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,520
you want to like all that stuff that

00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,960
they don't think about somebody asked me

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,880
they wanted to do a membership site and

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,140
they wanted to use WordPress and they

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,300
want to use WooCommerce and they want to

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,970
use with commerce subscriptions like

00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,920
okay have you ever done customer support

00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,940
do you know what happens when someone

00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,500
loses their password

00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,240
what if someone logs into your site and

00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,589
they can't see it do you know about how

00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,690
to clear cache on every single browser

00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:30,490
have you ever gotten an email where

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,720
someone says I paid what my credit card

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,430
didn't go through and now I can't get

00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,109
into my account how have you ever said

00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,670
had someone say to you I'm not gonna pay

00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:37,900
with credit card I only pay with PayPal

00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,750
and can you give me an email with the

00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:42,640
invoice like it's like Oh makes weird

00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,710
things that happen that you guys know

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,270
because you're in tech and you get all

00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,220
these questions and you've seen these

00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:52,240
weird things happen that the clients

00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,740
like no I don't want to do that I just

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,000
want to run my life coaching business I

00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,880
want to have my membership and how

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,050
people pay me lots of money and that's

00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,880
where it comes down to what's the

00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,859
lifestyle okay then you need a tech

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,240
person on tap do you have two three four

00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:06,430
hundred dollars a month you know

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,109
whatever it's gonna cost to run this for

00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,760
you do you have someone internally that

00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:11,319
can run this for you that I framed for

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,119
you I'm gonna be with you for like ever

00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:15,310
not someone's gonna leave in three

00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,740
months some intern but getting them to

00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:20,740
think about the business implications of

00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:23,800
having a website not to scare them but

00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:26,770
to set them up for success is my biggest

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,180
thing so I never I never know what it's

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,599
gonna be so I don't really have a

00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,490
process per se but I really look back at

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,040
what their business has been where

00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:38,650
they're going and try and make it so

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,760
that everything I do is about their

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,910
success because if they're not

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,410
successful then I'm not successful that

00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,410
makes sense yes

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,930
mm-hmm right

00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,500
require it just require it

00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,950
right

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:29,099
yeah yeah right

00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,839
and that's why I do that that's why I

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,490
switch my business model I was spending

00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:39,290
