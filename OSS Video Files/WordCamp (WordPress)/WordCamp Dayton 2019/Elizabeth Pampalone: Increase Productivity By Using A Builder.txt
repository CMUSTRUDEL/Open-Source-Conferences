	As perfectionists, admit it, you are one, we can spend hours on a site to get it just so. What if there was a way to achieve Just So, but faster? I want to dive into the time saving features a builder can offer. Not to mention the increased revenue streams buy using a builder. Donâ€™t let the idea of builder keep you away from the freedom it can provide. Come see what the builder business is all about!
Major takeaway would be to expose the general audience to the the time saving and integration features that are already in a builder eliminating the use of extra plugins and preventing vulnerabilities.
