how many people decided that maintaining

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,299
their own site may not be for them it's

00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,630
kind of hard sometimes you got to keep

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,039
up with it it's got to be on top of it

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:26,859
you can do it though you just got to

00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:28,990
keep on top of it and just a note I will

00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,890
be available the rest of the day I'll be

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,650
here and you know available for you no

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,719

that so if you have any other questions

00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,129
I got some good questions during the

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:47,020
break so thank you I was asked what I'm

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:50,170

corner here my image my video I'm

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,149

00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:58,989
called used loom comm and if we go to it

00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:01,390
I just stopped it but if you go to it

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:05,320

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,410
up so you can see it's called uloom comm

00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,970
and it is a free recording software it

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,090
also has a desktop version which is what

00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,090
I'm using right now start the recording

00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,490
okay welcome to the second part of

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,040
WordPress 101

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,700
that's the Dayton word camp so thank you

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,620
for being here we're going to go into

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,440
some plugins now and finish off this

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,680
segment of 101 we've got about an hour

00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,950
ish left maybe 45 minutes and then we'll

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,690
do some questions so at the end if you

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,220
have any extra questions we're gonna

00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,680
talk about plugins we talked about the

00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,690
site setup plugins that I use a little

00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,870
bit earlier so there's that list again

00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:04,420
it will be available on the site but

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,210
these plugins are for specific

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,070
industries and for specific reasons now

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,290
you don't want to use every single

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,690
plug-in that I tell you to showing you

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,850
then you get to where those guys are in

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,940
the back at 81 and we don't want that

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,320
for anybody so here are some things you

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,090
could use if you're trying to do

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,810
ecommerce is anybody trying to do

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:29,140
e-commerce oh my gosh it's like the

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,600
whole room uh let me ask a question of

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:38,860
you guys have you ever run an e-commerce

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:45,190
site before okay talk to that guy all of

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,900
you for me and if you've ever run one

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,400
before raise your hand and so people

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,440
know who to talk to okay

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,810
talk to the people to have their hands

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,910
raised because it is more than you might

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,080
think it is

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,790
would you agree you guys that have done

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,060
it it can be the biggest bear in your

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,590
life and take over your life there's so

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,910
much support there's so many things that

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,590
can go wrong I'm not trying to dissuade

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,989
you I'm trying to say like just get some

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
expert advice talk to somebody who's

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,870
done it because it may not be for you

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,640
and that's okay but if you really want

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,209
to do it you got to kind of know what

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,670
you're in for

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,690
okay it's like having a kid so um I like

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,780
some of these things for different

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,610
reasons for e-commerce easy digital

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,060
downloads how many of you are gonna do

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,450
digital content this is for you

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,050
okay so downloads PDFs video audio stuff

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,900
like that

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,790
whoa Commerce that's for any pretty much

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,720
any kind of e-commerce that you would

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,930
want to do shipping and all that jazz

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
restricted

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,299
content that's for like membership sites

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,390
you can restrict areas of your site so

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,739
that only gold level can see this or you

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,230
know and they can only see part of that

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,090
page but then platinum level can see the

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,060
whole page Plus this other page is just

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,099
for them I like to use when I did

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,409
membership sites I like to use member

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,930
Mouse see maybe heard of that one it's

00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,129
really good it is paid the reason I

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,310
liked it was because they were really

00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,590
responsive with their support and it's a

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,879
very easy to understand platform I feel

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,549
like sometimes WooCommerce can get a

00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,120
little complicated but it's very easy to

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,380
understand and and then seamless

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,509
donations how many of you were running

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,380
any kind of donations nonprofits that

00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,710
kind of stuff

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,680
churches those kind of things ministries

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:36,070
seamless donations is awesome it is so

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,990
freaking simple and it's done you not to

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,580
worry about all that junk like you set

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,039
up with stripe or PayPal I'm pretty sure

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,389
those both are in there and you just

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,180
have done you have donations it's done

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:50,830
so it's very very easy if you're just

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:56,050
doing donation that's really great what

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,669
was it I don't know there actually is I

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,099
have a client on patreon and they

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,530
actually there's a WooCommerce plugin

00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:04,539
for that I believe so I would use that

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,330
specifically and sometimes if you go to

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,740
the patreon documentation and you look

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,000
up how it connected to WordPress

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,289
sometimes they'll have a specific

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,530
plug-in they recommend and I would use

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,530
that if you're using a specific type of

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,849
system it's not PayPal or stripe or just

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,220
regular credit cards that go to a bank

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,780
account I would go to the company's

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,970
website like converge or patreon or

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,039
somebody whatever company they're using

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,810
for donations and I would look up what

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,520
their documentation is type in the word

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,349
WordPress and see if anything comes up

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,320
with hey use this plug-in or we like

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:40,150
this plug-in best yeah WooCommerce

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,430
versus Shopify is that your question -

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,940
okay great you were laughing so I

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,440
figured it was um it's gonna get getting

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,610
me kicked out of WordPress I know it's

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
gonna get me kicked out of WordPress

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,250
all right the question is what commerce

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,630
our Shopify

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,630
are you a developer

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:07,060
okay if you have the passion and the

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,010
drive and the time to really get into

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,040
WordPress on a developer level

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,900
I feel like WooCommerce is amazing

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,220
because it's so customizable and there's

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,590
so many things you can do with it

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,150
if you're like I just want to sell

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,860
pretty things like if that's kind of

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,300
like the mentality like I just want to

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,220
sell my stuff and be done with it undo

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,370
my other things like run my classes or

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,870
teach my things or do my videos or you

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,940
know whatever it is right like just sell

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,240
stuff and then do something else - it's

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,790
not your only deal and you're the

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,590
customization is like less important

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,330
does that make sense like do I have a

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,790
nice site but you don't need to have

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,350
like special FedEx shipping that ships

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,150
to packages like you want to be like the

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,920
next Amazon or Etsy or whatever right

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,290
that's not the point you want to just

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,180
sell stuff and do your other stuff then

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,160
I would say go something else if you

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,760
want to be more involved and you want it

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,280
to be more complex I had a woman who she

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,220
had a company that were she sold medical

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,910
device covers for people who had

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,790
colostomy stuff right and that's very

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,280
specific but she would have like a

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,470
hundred different fabrics she would have

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,540
you could add like gems and bows and

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,700
stuff like that to make it you know more

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,650
fun for like kids and stuff it's not the

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,470
like funnest topic in the world but it's

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,780
she needed some really complicated shop

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,900
stuff and WordPress with the only option

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,430
we looked at so many and it was there

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,920
was the only one we could use because he

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,270
was so customizable now she needed

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,710
people to help her do it because she

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,510
wasn't a developer she just wanted to do

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,530
her thing and sell her stuff and she

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,210
hired people like me and another

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,170
developer to like work on it together

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,180
and make it work

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,490
it's pain but we made it work because it

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,020
was so custom but if that's kind of the

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,370
direction you're heading or you want to

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,540
do like membership and stuff like that

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,830
that's direction you're heading

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,910
WordPress is good because even with

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,880
Commerce does memberships and

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,080
subscriptions and stuff like that

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,790
subscription boxes and those kind of

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,170
things but if you just want to sell and

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,390
not really worry about it and do some

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,940
other stuff then Shopify may be a better

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,010
option but you really have to go into

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,350
the brand and the lifestyle of the

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,790
business and I'm a branding expert so

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,120
that's kind of where I take it because I

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,520
want to

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,740
see the holistic side not just which is

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,389
better WordPress our Shopify but what's

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,620
better for you as an individual are you

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,479
gonna run this yourself are you gonna

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,850
hire a team you're gonna have a support

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,139
customer service group or Center or a

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,880
couple people that are running that part

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,770
of it what happens with returns what

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,419
happens with shipments that don't get

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,889
there how do you take stuff to the post

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,520
office are you doing all the posters of

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,190
stamps.com

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,360
like I pick along with those questions

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,610
there's a lot of stuff that goes into

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,500
e-commerce that's why I was like you

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,909
guys you need to talk to somebody you

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,969
know so you can get to those questions

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,520
and get some of those things out before

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,990
you really just pick one piece so I

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,660
would kind of maybe explore it a little

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,040
further if you haven't or talk to

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,500
somebody here that had raised their hand

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,910
just so that you can kind of get past

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,650
some of that and then you'll be able to

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,720
have a clearer and go oh yes clearly I

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,130
need to use this or this and you'll have

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,330
a really clear definition of it that

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,330
make sense yes

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,620
uh-huh so free stuff uh-huh

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,480
right I like easy digital downloads just

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,150
because they do have you can use it

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,190
without using a payment method if you're

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,540
doing a download for like an opt-in how

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,550
many people have an opt-in for their

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,650
email list like you give me your email

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,440
and I'll give you this PDF right or this

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,230
thing this video I like to actually do

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,750
that through the email marketing system

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,700
so I use mailer Lite and I use that

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,280
through the email marketing system so

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,140
they put their email in it says thank

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,060
you check your inbox the email that

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,140
comes to them has a link and that link

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,880
takes them to the PDF directly so no one

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,800
can get to that PDF unless they have

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,990
exactly that link which is kind of rare

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,730
and it's free anyway so if somebody

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,040
finds it randomly I'm not worried about

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,630
it so I don't usually do like a code or

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,660
something cuz if somebody goes to a cart

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,660
you have to put in a code unless you

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,950
have paid stuff to like it's a paid

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,020
thing and you're like hey I'm giving you

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,220
this for free it's worth $25 then

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,300
they're happy to put in the code they

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,280
want that thing right they don't to pay

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,440
the 25 but if it's just a zero dollar

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,880
amount thing and they're putting in a

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,320
code to get it you know or whatever they

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,970
have to put in sometimes leave in force

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,530
or credit card sometimes if there's even

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,450
a free amount I mean it's it's very

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,950
tricky with that so I try to use things

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,900
that are a little more alternative but

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,120
easy digital downloads has an option for

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,330
you there's no payment it's just a link

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,610
a button you can do it that way so the

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:48,420
questions about e-commerce yes not to

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,420
hard questions easy clothes yes

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,120
I like that a lot I've also done Etsy

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,649
integrated sites with WordPress people

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,180
that really are just crafty and they're

00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,860
like hey already got an Etsy shop but I

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,850
want my own site to showcase stuff that

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,560
I've done or do custom stuff then I have

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,209
them leave their stuff on Etsy they're

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,880
familiar with it already and there's a

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,009
couple of plugins once called Etsy 360

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,389
that you can use and actually just put

00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,680
your stuff in Etsy and do what he like

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:24,069
what he said with big Commerce and

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,509
poured it in done that's it you're done

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,810
with the you know and all the payments

00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,699
happen on the other platform and all the

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,920
inventory happens on the other platform

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:35,350
just like he said so you're really using

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,699
two pieces but one that's a like you

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,110
said a little more easy like a little

00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,279
easier than trying to deal with

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,259
WordPress reboot commerce you've got

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,089
that ease of kind of shopify bigcommerce

00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,600
that you're using any of your get used

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,600
to yes

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,750
donations for with additional

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,880
information yeah seamless donations will

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,620
do that you can add whatever fields you

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,920
want it to capture and it will you can

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,260
do that that way there's PayPal donation

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,819
plugins there's stripe donation plugins

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,940
like other ones other than just seamless

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,470
seamless is an actual specific plugin

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,060
but you can actually add your own fields

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,579
and will capture whatever information

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,860
you want you can make up sometimes I'll

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:17,949
even do it where I'll do a ninja form

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,839
first it'll say make a donation it'll

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,940
take them to a ninja form and then

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,949
instead of saying submit on the ninja

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,480
form it'll actually take them to a

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,130
second page where they do seamless

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,899
donations so I've already captured their

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,449
information and then they just pay

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,860
through seamless and it's done so it's

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,769
like using two pieces but for the

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,839
consumer it looks like one seamless they

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,550
just go from the form to the pay and

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,319
then they're done so you can do that

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:49,779
something like that - so more fancy but

00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:51,490
it works ok plugin tools how many of you

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,880
doing events you're gonna need an event

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,610
calendar okay the events calendar by

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,410
modern tribe is one of my favorites it's

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,180
my favorites it's really really good

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:07,560
they have a lot of updates they do and

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,560
it's just got a lot of great options Oh

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,770
just drop my mic hold on my stache is

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,839
failing okay

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,060
Instagram fee there's actually an

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,480
Instagram feed plug-in in the purpose of

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,370
just called Instagram feed and I really

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,260
like that as well because it just adds

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,610
an element of kind of updated content to

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,529
your site without you having to go in

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,510
there and update content so is your

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,390
current Instagram feed you put it

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,940
wherever you want pretty much with a

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,500
little shortcode and then of course

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,220
there's things like mail or light

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,149
MailChimp Constant Contact Emma all

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,980
those right

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,899
I like mailer like the best they're the

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,399
most you get the most for your money I

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,870
feel like with them I've done a lot of

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,790
research on different products and

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,089
they're the one who has the best you

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,410
know kind of value for money and they

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,420
have their own plugins so if you're

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,410
using a email marketing system you want

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,410
to look and see if they have a plugin

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,490
for WordPress and use that plug-in you

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,750
don't want to necessarily mess with the

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,880
code if you don't have to and all

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,200
embedding and all that stuff just find

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,589
whatever email marketing system you're

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,110
gonna use find their plug-in and just

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,020
use their plugin it'll be much easier

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,630
there's no code involved if you're gonna

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,829
be doing Google Analytics or if you know

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,260
you know you're gonna want to do that in

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,420
the future I use the monster insights

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,149
plug-in that's the easiest one I found

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,730
to use Google Analytics you need to set

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,649
up on a google account and then they'll

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,880
give you a nice little u code so what's

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,890
called a u code it's a bunch of numbers

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,350
strung together and you'll download

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,880
Google Analytics drop that number in and

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,529
then they'll both kind of connect up

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,630
that way there's a couple of there steps

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,959
but that's the gist of it yes you have a

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,959
question

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:06,030
yes yeah and I would really consider

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,370
looking at you know my other light if

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,110
you if you're using one already because

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,340
their payments are lower than a lot of

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,190
the other ones because once you get to a

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,780
certain point that you have to pay the

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,030
other thing is sometimes they restrict

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,650
access to certain things like automation

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,920
which is what I talked about with

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,160
opt-ins the automation of someone signs

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,110
up they get put in X list then a trigger

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,640
happens like an automation happens and

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,590
with with MailChimp they actually

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,510
restrict that to only paid users in some

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,880
cases like in some with certain things

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,170
you can do with it so I like that mailer

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,970
like doesn't do that you can use it on

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,160
the free version and they also give you

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,810
heat maps and all kind of stuff so look

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,270
at the one you're using and can do some

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,830
comparisons just so that you have

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,930
they're like the most pieces like I said

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,030
you want to use fewer plugins right so

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,010
instead of using something like

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,420
MailChimp and then maybe you have to use

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,550
another plugin help you with automation

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,050
or something maybe another platform

00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,580
would help with with that if you're if

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,200
you're using those kind of things so

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,910
just trying to make sure you get the

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,140
most you can in the least amount of

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,030
items that you're trying to either use

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,840
or pay for because I don't think you

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,840
should pay for things you don't have to

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,750
pay more maybe I also have a question

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,370
okay

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,080
apply online which is a job board and

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,730
simple job board if you're doing any

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,950
kind of recruiting or anything like that

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,780
or you have the people want to have like

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,140
a hiring or career section on their site

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,680
you can use these they're free they're

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,390
really good they're in the repository if

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,840
you're gonna do any podcasting blueberry

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:37,410
is on here and then also Coast schedules

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,590
anybody heard of Co schedule awesome so

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,480
CO schedule excuse me is an online

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,610
calendar for your WordPress and you

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,340
might think well WordPress lets me

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:51,600
schedule posts if I want to so if we go

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:56,190
into post here then we look at this one

00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:00,980
I could schedule this for any time I

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,980
want right let's say I put it in August

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,199
and I say okay and I have it scheduled

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:12,550
when I go to look at it in posts this is

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:15,459
what I get a list I get a list I don't

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,679
get anything else I just get a list what

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:21,720
Co schedule does is it gives you a grid

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:25,360
calendar it shows it to me on an actual

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,040
square grid calendar which is what for

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,170
me it's much easier to China of like

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,970
view especially when you have like 50 or

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,830
60 or 70 or 100 posts and your

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,440
scheduling them out for a year up you

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,520
know whatever it is six months you can

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,679
actually go through and see where your

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,050
posts are listed then what else Co

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,520
schedule does is it says hey this is a

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,980
great post do you want to post this on

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,080
Facebook Pinterest Twitter that's a dead

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,870
that's it right and it will then put

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,400
those links in your grid calendar

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,340
because you might actually want to post

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,850
something in April and then have it post

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,800
again to social media in August it lets

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,110
you do all that right in Co schedule

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,240
it's awesome so if you're gonna do

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,580
blogging it's definitely the way to go

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,830
I also use some social pilot which is a

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,480
third-party app first for scheduling

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,309
those things but if you want to kind of

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,040
keep it contained in WordPress it's a

00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,490
great plugin very light but it does a

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,490
really good job

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,350
posting to multiple pages or groups on

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,920
Facebook with one yes you can I believe

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:37,520
you can do that let's go schedule all

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,480
right tools I have some tools here now

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,710
some of these get a little more

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,630
complicated but I'm going to explain

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,780
them as I go so duplicate page I

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,310
mentioned before duplicate post I'm

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,690
sorry I mentioned duplicate post before

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,730
but as you create pages maybe you'll

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,410
create a really cool page for like each

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,880
of your people that work at your company

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,560
or whatever and you're like I really

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,060
want to reuse this because the BIOS in

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,180
the right place the photos in the right

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,340
place you can use duplicate page it's a

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,230
plug-in and you could just put that in

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,550
and duplicate your pages so then you

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,610
don't have to redo each of those pages

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,150
every time now remember I mentioned

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,560
builders and I mentioned Divi with Divi

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,750
you don't need duplicate post or

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,340
duplicate page it's built into the theme

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,780
so that's where you kind of start

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,220
eliminating some of those plugins right

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,570
I keep hitting this that's where you're

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,390
eliminating started eliminating some

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,610
plugins so also when you have plugins in

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,900
your your section there you can turn

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,030
them off if you're not using them you

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,200
just turn them off they're called

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,240
deactivate they're still sitting in

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,280
there could you just deactivate them

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:43,370
I'll show you for example we'll get a

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:49,370
duplicate page in here here's duplicate

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:54,110
page and we'll do duplicate post so you

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,300
can see them both okay let's go into

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,620
plugins here they are they're not

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:03,770
activated I can activate duplicate post

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:06,770
activate duplicate page use them okay

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:10,520
now I'm done I can just deactivate one

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:12,080
or both and it doesn't have to run it's

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,370
just sitting in there the code it's just

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,640
sitting there waiting for me to start it

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,700
up and use it

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,110
site origin builder now when I used blue

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,780
Sheik themes when I used to use those

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,970
exclusively I used the site origin

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,400
builder on top of them now with

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,500
Guttenberg it may not be as needed but

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,730
if you're not gonna if you have

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,840
Gutenberg's not your favorite or you

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,860
play with a little bit you're just kind

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,340
of like it doesn't make sense to me

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,899
sometimes that happens like we

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,309
these developers they build these things

00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,570
and they're like this is awesome

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,220
makes total sense and then I get in

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,350
there and I'm like what this does not

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,269
make sense at all example HootSuite and

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,950
social pilot HootSuite I don't

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,169
understand social pilot I do I don't get

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,110
it but it's another type of builder

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:55,350
that's kind of mirroring modules and

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,929
columns and putting things in blocks so

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,850
you basically say I want some text here

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,860
and I have three columns I want some

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,960
text on this side and I want a picture

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,129
on this side in the middle I want you

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,019
know another picture that's an arrow

00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,309
that points to the picture or points of

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,200
the text or whatever you want to put

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,730
there or you can have three columns of

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,470
text and you have a picture on top of

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,299
each one like your your services or

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,950
something so you can really be really

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,230
more flexible with it than just having

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,119
here's your text box like it does in

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,049
WordPress now like I said they've got

00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,179
Gutenberg and you've got a lot more

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,799
options but site origin builder is

00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,929
another one that you can try out and

00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,759
play with but it's a plugin goes on top

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,379
of your theme and I found it really

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,049
useful and helpful so you can try it out

00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:36,869
and see if it works for you easy mode

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:40,529
all modal's I mean know what that is

00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:43,259
modal um is actually those pop-up

00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,480
thingies that come up that are not the

00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,999
ones that say hey do you want to save

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,379
10% or whatever those are like the email

00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,619
marketing ones right where you put your

00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:54,990
email in you say okay I'll save 10%

00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:58,440
these are like hey you should contact us

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,600
you click it and it pops up a whole

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,769
contact box

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,879
now it's be careful with these because

00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,730
remember we're designing for mobile

00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:07,830
right so yes be careful with them but

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,529
you can use them in certain cases you

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:13,139
can also have them pop up to show like a

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,690
tooltip or like a text tip maybe a

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:17,759
definition of something so I've used

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,259
those in those cases before so you

00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,690
eliminate some of that text on your page

00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:25,950
and put it in a little like pop-up box

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:29,669
instead jetpack is another plug-in that

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:33,119
typically comes with WordPress but you

00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:36,869
can have to activate it let me show it

00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:42,029
to you it does require you have a

00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:44,250
wordpress.com account to utilize it but

00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:47,119
there are some really cool things that I

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,119
like that it does

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:55,750
and let's do some screenshots here so it

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,490
has a few things that it does does some

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,960
more analytic stuff that's more like on

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,880
the site not necessarily Google

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,220
Analytics but like within the site it

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,190
gives you some analytics it does some

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,840
stuff through wordpress.com if you have

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,700
a blog and you want it to kind of be

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,400
posted out with all the other blogs it

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,830
kind of helps with that it does some

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,540
stuff with images and video they're just

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,610
a little like little tweaks that it will

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,070
give you that WordPress doesn't have

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,180
inherently and it's really nice so if

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,950
you want to look through that list

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,810
there's if you install the plug-in it'll

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,220
say here's all the things you can do and

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,040
you can turn them on or off it gives you

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,300
carousel images just little little

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,190
tweaky things that I think you're cool

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,540
sometimes I use it in websites and

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,130
sometimes they don't really depends on

00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,580
the client what kind of content I'm

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:44,470
doing it can be a little heavy so use it

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:46,060
sparingly Messenger chat is actually how

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,560
many people have a Facebook page for

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,540
their business or the company they're

00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,150
trying to work with okay it's a

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,460
messenger chat so what this does is it

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:58,030
allows you to someone to message you

00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,550
using messenger on your website so it

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,440
puts a little blue messenger circle in

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,270
the corner just like almost like you

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,830
know chat with us live kind of thing and

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,040
it will actually message you through

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,990
Facebook so it's pretty cool opening

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,270
hours I like this app this plugin as

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,800
well it's great for if you have some of

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,780
these hours that change a lot or maybe

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,480
they're expanding or they're downsizing

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,830
or they're growing or whatever it may be

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,600
then you can have them allow them to

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,640
change their hours a lot but it's always

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,350
updated on the website and you can put

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
it in multiple places and only change it

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,290
one time so you're not having to go to

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,550
the home page and change it and the

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,320
footer and change it in the contact

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,630
patient change it you just put it in

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,210
once and if you change it once on that

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,650
section within the plug-in it changes it

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,580
on all the other sections of your site

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:45,550
for you maybe you've changed your domain

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,280
or you've changed a page like maybe your

00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,520
page is about - us and now it's just

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,680
about right forward slash about and you

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,800
want it to redirect so somebody has

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,180
tagged and favorited about - us when

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,610
they go back to that page it's gonna say

00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,120
404 error we don't find this page we

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,490
don't know what

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,160
about because the page is gone so what

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,240
you can do is use redirection and it'll

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,670
say about - us is now just forward slash

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,110
about and it will redirect them so

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,760
anything that they've they've you know

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,620
tagged as a favorite in their website in

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,140
their browsers it'll actually redirect

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,840
them to the correct page sometimes I've

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,070
gone in and cleaned up sites for people

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,840
there's a lot of pages they don't need

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,000
so I'll just make a list of all the

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,070
slugs and I'll redirect them to the

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,020
services page like they'll have a ton of

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,760
pages they're just so extra and I'll

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,050
just take all those slugs put a little

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,510
document together and then when I'm done

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,030
I go into redirection and start adding

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,890
them in and say this random weird page

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,960
goes to services now so if somebody had

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,190
favoured it for some reason it'll just

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,270
take them to the services page this is

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,740
where they should be in the first place

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,830
or whatever it whichever page didn't

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,660
mean needs to be um if you want to get

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,240
fancy with stuff and you need to know an

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,580
ID of a page sometimes this happens with

00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,800
galleries if you're making galleries

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,510
with photos you might need to know the

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,240
idea of a photo because WordPress

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,970
assigns a number to everything a reveal

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,429
IDs is a plug-in that I use occasionally

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,990
to show me the ID of something if you

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,660
run across a plugin that says we need

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,070
the idea of this page it's not shown

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,179
anywhere but this plug-in will show you

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:21,130
what the ideas and then WP file manager

00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:23,950
sometimes the media library can be a

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,720
little bit kind of squirrely and not as

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,270
you know user friendly as it should be

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,890
or it could be and so the file manager

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,010
just gives you a little bit different

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,059
view of all the files you've uploaded

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,850
and some of the files that are in your

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,590
site so you can go in there and you know

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,850
see it in a little different view like I

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,770
said sometimes things work for your

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,950
brain and sometimes they don't so this

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:47,470
is just another way of viewing it now I

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,630
did have a question during the break

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,250
that I wanted to address and it was the

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:55,890
difference between oh wait do we have a

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,890
question yes

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,850
no you would you would use the plug-in

00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,159
install the plug-in and it would show

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:09,309
you the files in a different way just in

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,809
a different view essentially no it's

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:14,289
connected to the site inherent like

00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:20,679
inside the site the question I had was

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:24,340
about PHP and CSS so two totally

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:27,549
different languages and I'm gonna tell

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,850
you another story so yes I'd get comfy

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:34,269
hope you like stories guys when I was 13

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:38,049
I went to the library very similar to

00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:40,299
this one in Ohio and I told my mom I

00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:42,850
said I want to go to this class and

00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:47,350
she's like fine I'll take you was at

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:50,080
night and it was an HTML 101 class I was

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:54,159
the youngest person there everyone else

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,799
was in their 30s 40s had briefcases

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,269
scowls on their faces it was you know

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,840
seven o'clock at night they hadn't had

00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,580
dinner

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,470
they were like gonna be here for work

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:09,190
and they were struggling and I was over

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:12,129
there like I loved it I thought it was

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,749
the best thing in the world so we get

00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,090
ready to leave and it was like a two and

00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:18,519
a half hour class it was long we get

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,989
ready to leave and I wait by the table

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,049
you know the librarians they put out all

00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:26,850
the books right and they're like okay

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:30,669
check out the books on HTML this is 1998

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:32,649
1999 and I'm standing there like oh man

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:35,320
these books look so awesome and all the

00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,730
adults are just they just leave there's

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,100
they door they're gone

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:44,889
they need to eat dinner and I just take

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:47,049
all the books and I do this I put him on

00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:50,080
my bag and I took them all home and I

00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:53,080
read every single one and from then on I

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,340
couldn't I couldn't let my mother you

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,909
know get on me about not knowing a

00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,869
language because I did just not one she

00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:03,820
could speak and I I loved it I mean it

00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,850
was like learning another language and

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:09,009
to this day I can sit down with an open

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,059
notepad you know weird you know I like a

00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,320
Word document now we're doctoring but

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:14,590
like you know like a notepad document

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,710
notes and just a text editor and just

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:20,230
type away and make you something halfway

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,160
decent WordPress has really helped you

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,850
don't have to do that anymore

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:27,250
but learning that language was so I

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,650
opening for me and to this day I use it

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,970
almost every single day in website

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:36,760
design and if we talk about PHP and CSS

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,120
it's just two other languages that

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,370
WordPress uses and HTML is pretty much

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,640
the basis of a lot of the web as far as

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:49,870
like being the foundation I guess it's

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:54,000
used a lot but PHP really allows the web

00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:56,590
to be more flexible and integrated and

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,220
plugged in I guess to other pieces of

00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,050
the web

00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,120
whereas HTML it was a little harder to

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,420
kind of shove everything in to this a

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,940
little more archaic language and then

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,010
CSS is just another piece of that and I

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,510
call it the pretty language because it

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,250
really does a lot of things to make

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,010
things look beautiful it's the color

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,590
that's the fonts it's the image resizing

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,630
it's how your site's look responsive and

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,070
when you're on a phone you don't see

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,990
this photo or you don't see this video

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,030
you see this photo instead so the site

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,680
loads quicker and all that little stuff

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,340
that just happens you don't even notice

00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:33,880
consumer all those languages but

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,620
learning HTML as a child and being in

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,010
that world from you know from being a

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,200
teenager until now I can say 18 years

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,880
later it's still just as fun it's still

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,760
just as exciting and if you ever get a

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,340
chance to go to a class like a a library

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,690
class or you can audit college classes

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,160
you can go to these you know local

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,050
colleges and just say ham and odd at the

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,080
CSS class or I'm going to audit the PHP

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,850
class do it because you know I'm not a

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,720
language person I don't I mean I learned

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,880
French as a kid

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,670
I'll put T aside I got that sitsit I

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,870
came in asked over the bathroom and I

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:10,210
don't remember any of it but HTML it's

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,190
in there forever so if you get a chance

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,290
and you're not sure exactly what to do

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,930
with them or how to use them look up

00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,340
local classes look up you know local

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,930
areas but it's it's really the

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,190
foundation those three languages are

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,560
really a lot of the foundation of the

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,090
web and WordPress is relies heavily on

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,009
them and so as you go through

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,110
you will see things like iframes which

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,850
is HTML and you'll see things that are

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,620
you know the CSS so we talked about in

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,230
the customizer there's additional CSS

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,029
and when you go to say they say oh I'm

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,559
gonna do this with this button they're

00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:40,480
gonna say put this in your site and put

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,710
this in your site copy this code and if

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,779
you don't know how to read it and at

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,299
least understand it a little bit it can

00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:48,220
be really frustrating and so getting

00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:49,690
just a little bit of knowledge can

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,789
really go a long way for you to be able

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,769
to look at something and go I kind of

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,749
understand it I couldn't write it but I

00:31:53,769 --> 00:32:04,090
can kind of grasp what's happening you

00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:05,590
had a question yeah you go to the

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,360
administration office and you tell them

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,830
you want to audit a class and sometimes

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,450
it's like 50 bucks or something real

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,369
small amounts I don't know how much it

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,559
is here but you can go to local colleges

00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:16,629
community colleges and look at their

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,960
audit programs sometimes even have like

00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:21,820
free programming for adults during the

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,409
day you know if you're over a certain

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,269
age or sometimes they have programming

00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,799
at night for like community education

00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,330
and a lot of times it's the same

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,070
professors and the same people that are

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,539
doing adjunct they'll teach those

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,490
classes as well to make some extra money

00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,980
so and it's just a couple you know it's

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,210
not usually a lot and just you can even

00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,950
like you said just awed it a college

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:45,970
class in some cases - yeah

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:48,490
do you have question Linda yeah Linda is

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,740
the online an online class version Yanis

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,049
that's a good one - yeah I like I like

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,749
the in-person stuff cuz you know I like

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,749
people so I like this do good

00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,360
yes

00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:12,650
what is it I can't remember next session

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,640
he's gonna do it I know right what was

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,880
their other questions I saw a bunch of

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,280
hands wimp in MAPP he's gonna go into

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,830
him which I think right you're gonna go

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,230
into him okay so he'll tell you all

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,179
about that I do the simple stuff -

00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,360
kidding he's gonna go into that though

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:32,960
any other questions I had saw some hands

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,460
okay um so yeah so is that cover those

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
things everybody got any other questions

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:41,270
about that stuff or any other WordPress

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:44,650
related stuff no my gosh you guys just

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,650
know everything it's awful yes

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,400
so you have a customized theme from a

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,650
vendor you don't use anymore and you

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,960
want to kind of start new I would

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,389
probably say go with a staging site so

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
you don't mess up your current site so

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:14,520
going to will go into the hosting setup

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,139
a staging if we can rebuild on that

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,450
change the theme out do whatever the

00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,750
heck you want cuz it's not live and then

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:25,470
once that's ready push that live that's

00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:27,720
how I would probably approach it okay

00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,919
