I'm going to post some links in a little

00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:15,010
thing called chat role and I have it

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,140
right here and I'm gonna post some links

00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,900
in there and then what I've as we're

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,160
doing this and that's pretty much it for

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,789
that I'm also going to be teaching

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,900
tomorrow the intro on the productivity

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,110
increasing productivity with a builder

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,400
class at 10:45 so if you want to learn

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,410
more about builders which I'm gonna kind

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,609
of touch on here then you'll want to

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,899
come to that as well and we'll have

00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:42,089
slides and chat roll - ok so let's get

00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,089
started with some fancy WordPress stuff

00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:49,359
and like I said my name is Elizabeth I

00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,899
do a lot of stuff with WordPress this is

00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,639
my 18th year in the industry and I owned

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,399
my own business as a website designer

00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:59,079
for 12 years so it's a very sustainable

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,289
model if you're looking to do this for

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,999
yourself as in to do websites for others

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,310
like I said this is 12 years in business

00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,380
for myself my husband actually worked

00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,810
with me for five years of that so even

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,920
two people can earn an income on that

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,390
now he's doing some other fun stuff

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,220
about building water treatment for us so

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,920
ok so we're gonna start with the

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:25,870
dashboard how many of you have a

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,000
wordpress site already up ok good now if

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,490
you have your computer you can log into

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,200
that and just follow along with me if

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,910
you don't I will have it on the screen

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,350
here and then if you do not have

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,790
something to take notes if you like to

00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,350
do paper notes while you're looking at

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,110
your computer which is sometimes I like

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,990
to do I do have a few notebooks up here

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,850
if you want one you may come get one but

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,409
you will need to probably want to take

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,540
notes with this but I would log into

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,640
your site if you can and follow along

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,400
with me in the dashboard if you see

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,230
weird things that I do not have we'll

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,700
have to talk about that later because it

00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,770
means you probably put something in it's

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:05,050
not a standard piece of WordPress so

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,570
let's talk about this little thing

00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,330
called the dashboard I do like the way

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,920
the WordPress does this I like that it's

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,420
kind of side by side I like that it is

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,770
really easy to see everything all at

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,900
once and let me

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:25,530
my little button it's easy to see

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,180
everything all at once and you can also

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,470
it's pretty standard across every part

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,610
of WordPress so if you go into one

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,720
WordPress site you're gonna see this

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,670
dashboard if you goin to another

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,490
WordPress site you're gonna see this

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,780
dashboard okay and that's what I like

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,360
about WordPress is that no matter what

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,740
site you're going into you know it you

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,510
get it and now there may be some weird

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,920
stuff in there but you'll figure those

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,820
pieces out rather than having to try and

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,720
figure out the whole thing all over

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,720
again it allows for what I call extreme

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,880
customization if you are that fancy and

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,980
you want to be extra you can do as much

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,480
stuff as you want with WordPress it is

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,600
pretty much the sky's the limit there's

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,400
a lot of even major major websites even

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,780
like Disney uses WordPress and stuff

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,340
like that I mean they you have these

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,350
major sites you would never have thought

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,930
we're on WordPress running on WordPress

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,730
and you can actually go to wordpress.org

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,710
and see some of those sites they have

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,210
like a little gallery of sites that have

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,160
been built on WordPress so you can see

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,330
how kind of crazy you might be using a

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,070
site you didn't even know was running

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:27,850
WordPress I like to keep it as basic as

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,200
possible and I like to keep things

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,840
really simple my whole thing is about

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,370
simply profitable brands how many of you

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,560
in here own a business ok and how many

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,820
of you are like have a business where

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,910
you help other people with their

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,010
websites so like the other half ok good

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,170
so I'm gonna try and touch on both of

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,910
those things today and like he said if

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,610
you have any questions I'll try and

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,160
catch arms up as I look around the room

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,470
so but you know keep it up there or just

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,850
kind of say hey and I'll try and get to

00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,980
you as we go through if you have a

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,390
question the other thing about WordPress

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,820
is it's a really really well supported

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,410
community as you can see here that like

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,790
you said this is an online thing and

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,900
we're all actually sitting here

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,240
physically in the same room which is

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,340
pretty cool some of us are nerdier than

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,100
others you're very welcome to meet me

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,209
and so it's really fun to meet so many

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,190
different people from so many different

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,989
backgrounds you get free and paid

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,060
options with a lot of things there's

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,560
themes there's plugins there's all kinds

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,600
of stuff and there's always free options

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,450
and there's always paid options

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,460
I'm a fan of paid options in certain

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,850
cases and we'll talk about that as we

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,850
get there

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,770
okay how many people know that WordPress

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,960
is for was originally intended for

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,420
blogging okay awesome

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,050
has anybody blogged on WordPress okay

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,790
good there is a very big question in the

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,110
community sometimes with new people

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,210
people have started out with WordPress

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,510
what's the difference between a page and

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,860
a post so pages and posts can sometimes

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,130
almost seem identical and they have a

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,830
lot of the same properties but posts are

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,990
the blog entries themselves they come

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,820
with an RSS feed

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,890
it's things for like news entries

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,800
something you want to keep tabs of on a

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,880
regular basis announcements that kind of

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,170
stuff

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,870
pages on the other hand is where your

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,370
content lives and it's more static I

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,530
mean you can change it obviously but

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,450
it's not meant to be kind of changing

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,160
all the time it's meant to be there so

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,150
that it has the information someone can

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,760
get you all the time like an about page

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,360
or a contact page you can also embed

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,970
content on pages you can on post as well

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,740
but like I said with posts they're meant

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,110
to be to be rolling they're meant to be

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,060
moving and changing out you know newest

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,980
at the top all the time and if you embed

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,260
content on a post it might get buried

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,110
with your other posts so embedding

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,880
content on static pages is better you

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,120
can also leave use pages for landing

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,370
pages and I use a platform within

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,040
WordPress that is really good for

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,830
landing pages so you don't want to take

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,600
note of that when we get to themes there

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,680
are a couple of things about posts and

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,410
pages I'm gonna go in here and show you

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,660
there's all these little things right

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,700
here can you see at the top of the word

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,260
pages I know it's small but there's all

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,910
mine published draft pending trash you

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,770
may not see that in yours you may not

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,360
have all those things in there so I had

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,920
to create posts and draft them and

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,200
create posts and trash them to create

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,210
post and penned them so that you could

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,250
see all those options if you see any of

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,500
those those are normal all means you're

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,760
looking at all the posts mine means

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,510
you're looking at post that you have

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,550
published under your user publish means

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,990
you're looking at a post that's already

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,020
published it's out there it's on the the

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,310
website itself

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,170
draft obviously we know what that is

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,600
pending means that maybe someone else

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,610
published a post and they don't have

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,590
access to publish posts and so it goes

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,690
into drought are pending and that means

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,850
you as the administrator should go in

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,790
and check on that pending post and maybe

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,350
make it live or put it back to draft so

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,580
they can go in and re-edit it if they

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,030
need to change something else

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,310
so actually had a client require that I

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,140
I'm the administrator he said I want

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,390
this my friend to run part of the

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,610
website this was you literally yesterday

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,440
and I gave her the site access a couple

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,700
weeks ago I gave her editor status we're

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,490
gonna talk about users in a little bit

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,630
gave her editor status he's like yeah

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:31,030
she knows what she's doing she'll be

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,530
okay I trusted him don't do that and he

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,270
gave her that we gave her the access I

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,460
went in yesterday to look at the website

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,530
just to check on it the entire front

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,420
page is completely wrong it was all down

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,980
there was page things missing there was

00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,890
dark text on light our on dark

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,490
backgrounds it was a mess and it's my

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,480
site

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,900
so I basically reverted it back

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,310
59 versions which she had done and I put

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,140
it back to what it was that I did and I

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,360
said when she's done with that page I

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,610
drafted a page for her and said when

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,169
she's done then we'll put it up but I'm

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,430
not doing that right now and so I

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,280
actually had to go in and change her

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,200
access as a user so that she can only do

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,450
pending pages she's not allowed to

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,800
publish anymore so she wouldn't be one

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,900
of those people that would be in pending

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,250
now when something is in pending if you

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,930
let someone do this and you let someone

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,450
have a publish publish a post or publish

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,300
a page and it's pending they cannot edit

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,040
it until you've either approved it or

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,630
until it's drafted again so it's kind of

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,090
like in a limbo when it's in pending

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,410
that's I gave that story to kind of

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,610
illustrate that point that they really

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,680
can't do anything with it until it's

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,360
done I'm out of pending and then of

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,380
course trash is its case you dropped or

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,180
you delete something you didn't mean to

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,710
delete or you delete something and you

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:44,020
decide you want it back later it's

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,030
always in the trash okay let's go to the

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,120
next part we're gonna talk about post so

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,430
we'll stay here categories I love

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,170
categories that WordPress allows us to

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,900
use this there are two things called

00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:05,950
categories and tags yes question

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:05,950
yeah yeah

00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,939
that's probably cooler stone content is

00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,319
a themed thing probably so it's probably

00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:17,019
something they're a plugin or a theme is

00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,009
throwing in there and that would be

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,839
something you'd want to talk to the

00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,739
people at the happiness bar about and

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,239
you can talk to me I'll be in there

00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:23,499
later but yeah you can kind of talk to

00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:28,449
somebody about that specifically about

00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:30,009
that theme categories in posts there's

00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,199
categories and tags does anybody know

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,169
the difference I just told you the

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:36,609
difference so you can know but anyway

00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:39,009
high-level categories they're like

00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:42,269
things like I put on your business tips

00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,769
tech inspiration like that high-level

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,239
basic doesn't really tell you much about

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,929
what the post is about but just kind of

00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,049
gives you a category right then tags are

00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:55,779
more specific and tags are not

00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:58,059
necessarily used on the website so that

00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,409
you can do like you can see them a lot

00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,689
of times you see a post it'll have a

00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,729
photo the title and then I'll have some

00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:06,459
nup names under it you know inspiration

00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:09,789
in tech or something like that but then

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:13,179
the tags are more for searching and SEO

00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:14,799
and things like that so if you want to

00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,720
do that then you do something like time

00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,659
management email marketing Facebook

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,209
posts those are very specific and you

00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:24,489
would use those as like tags on Apple

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,589
iOS Android apps printers it's like a

00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:28,359
tech you know that's tech but it's not

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,249
it's really specific and then

00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:32,259
inspiration you have children family

00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:35,409
failure you know that those kind of

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,909
specific pieces now I'm telling you this

00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:42,899
and I meant to say this at the beginning

00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:42,899
and I forgot you're gonna hear a lot of

00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,089
that's not really helpful to the

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,910
community so I try to get people to say

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,620
taken all the pieces pick the ones that

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,350
you think are the best for you and then

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,300
follow those people that say those

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,100
things it's always good to get other

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,079
opinions to see if your opinion changes

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,910
but at the same time you don't want to

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,470
like disrupt everything by saying well

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,720
so-and-so said this and you don't know

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,370
what you're talking but because there's

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,290
so many different ways to do it there's

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,850
so many different avenues to the same

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,290
end so it's kind of like Ohio roads you

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,490
can take 50 different roads to get to

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,170
one place because there's so many back

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,820
roads which is awesome so it's kind of

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,199
like that but just take this like I said

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,470
with a grain of salt if you think I'm

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,730
being silly don't tell me because

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,459
there's still like I said a lot of ways

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,380
to kind of skin a cat here all right so

00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:58,760
you get the tight difference between

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,720
tags and categories that make sense okay

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,310
categories I did have I want something

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,440
on here about changing the default name

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,940
or adding a new default level when we

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,920
get into settings which is a little bit

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,560
further down we're gonna see that we can

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,190
change this default category it's call

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,230
done categorized it's in every WordPress

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,480
installation and if you do not put a

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,490
category to a post it will automatically

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,949
be shoved here as you can see I had one

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,760
published post and it shows my count of

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:28,829
one this is really annoying and really

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,300
ugly looking when you've posted a really

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,600
great website and then you have this

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,190
uncatted Erised thing sticking out there

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,079
listed somewhere it just looks like you

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,390
didn't finish it all the way so what I

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,649
like to do is you can do quick edit you

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,529
can actually change the name of this

00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,480
default category sometimes I name it

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,600
like general or you know something like

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,339
that and then or news or you know

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,579
whatever that main thing is I'm using

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,019
the blog for or you can add a second

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,850
category if you want to leave on

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,029
categorize and leave it as the kind of

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,649
default you can make a new category name

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,930
to whatever you want and then we go to

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,730
settings you can actually say Mike my

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,620
default is not uncatted rised it's this

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,149
new one that I made so it's up to you

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,769
how you want to do it but I just like to

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,870
go in here change the name of this one

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,370
and everything is fine because this is

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,740
the default anytime you make a pay a

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,569
post it's gonna automatically default to

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,389
this unless you have lots of other

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,100
categories you're trying to

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,100
work with and you've already added

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,439
adding a category is really simple you

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,029
just go to categories and right here it

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:33,019
says add a new category you type the

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,220
name and the slug this is one of the

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,019
really interesting things about

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,670
WordPress is there's slugs all over the

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,670
place so you may notice slug is

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,820
WordPress if you watch it I like to have

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,100
it ready before I get it into WordPress

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,590
but it for some reason so let's do an

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,350
image and it's not ready always do a few

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,630
things in WordPress so you can change

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,240
the scale you can flip it you could try

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,799
it horizontally thinking too and then

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,409
this little thing down here the

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,630
thumbnail settings it says all image

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,210
apply changes to all image sizes just

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,220
the thumbnail or all sizes except the

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,080
thumbnail and sometimes you want to

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,840
Center the thumbnail on something really

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,610
specific maybe you just want the globe

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,820
and the thumbnail or you just want the

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,980
time to go part in the thumbnail and you

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,270
can address those little things but I

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,789
like to keep things again like I said

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,799
simple I'm just showing you what's all

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,270
here but I like to keep it as simple as

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:16,549
I can if you haven't even uploaded and

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,470
then you upload a smaller image or you

00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:21,049
upload a larger image and it's the same

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,809
one there's actually a plug-in to let

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,309
you do replacements word purses let you

00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,470
do replacements and what happens when

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:30,260
you upload an image to WordPress is it

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,720
makes it in about in 20 different sizes

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,460
because it has it for different sized

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,230
screens and that kind of stuff it has

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,270
less responsive things fancy things that

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,890
it does which are really cool but it

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,900
also kind of a your site down if you

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,090
have images in there multiple times then

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,890
also when you're looking at the image in

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,990
the grid go back here we're looking at

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,940
it here you may not know which one is

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,980
which you might have uploaded the bright

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,150
consecutive and then which one is the

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,730
right one you know which one's the

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,799
higher resolution or whatever so there's

00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,630
actually a plugin which we'll go to in a

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,039
few minutes we get two plugins but it

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,409
actually will help you actually place

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,059
the image rather than uploading it

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,500
multiple times the same went over and

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,440
over with different sizes and

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,150
resolutions and the other reason you

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,919
want to replace this for SEO maybe that

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,960
image has been there a while and maybe

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,500
you're doing some optimization or

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,990
something

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,940
and that image has and it's an SEO

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,040
figures out into the Google search world

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,690
you don't want to necessarily mess with

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,610
that and you don't want to change the

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,460
name of the image to number two or you

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,750
know a different totally different name

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,640
replacing it will basically keep the

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,560
same name and everything and all the

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,360
links will be the same but the image

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,820
will be changed the actual properties of

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,620
the image will be changed do the smaller

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,850
image or the higher resolution whatever

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:50,780
may be all right questions about the

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:56,230
media library coming all right that's

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:59,210
kind of an easy one here we go SEO so

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,430
this was a thought there's not a bad one

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,570
or a wrong one not necessarily I mean I

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,770
feel like there's tomorrow ones but

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,200
that's just mean um

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,000
and lady said don't go to somebody and

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,760
gonna go they said this and then another

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,350
person like well that person Tom I'd

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,790
like to get one good answer

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,500
you really do have to find what works

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,650
for you it depends on what you're trying

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,060
to do with SEO a lot of people will say

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,530
well they'd have to be you know good

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,270
food goes out of rhythm so they're gonna

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,920
say well you need to be on all the

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,810
search engines and you have to do google

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,400
analytics and there's like all these are

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,190
community good keywords you need to do

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,380
you use Yoast in videos or talk about a

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,030
plugin later there's all this stuff out

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:40,640
there and I'm not opinion I think you

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,110
should just do what you can do and try

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,820
the things that people say if you think

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,320
that they feel right um

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,100
it's always stuck there resonates with

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,160
people and I'm very big on my call more

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,020
organic kind of SEO I do things that are

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,970
important but I also don't overdo it

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,590
I don't like SEO it's not my business

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,110
there are people that do SEO is like for

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,030
a living and that's great but it's not

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,800
me and so I try and do a few little

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,750
things that I can do kind of more like

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,970
integrated SEO where you're just doing

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,530
it as you go rather than trying to build

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,410
a site and then go back and do all the

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,640
SEO happen after the fact and so let's

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,900
talk about a couple of those like best

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,680
practice things but in some cases I'll

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,050
go

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,150
like you know catch me outside after or

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,730
something but in some cases a lot of SEO

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,650
stuff is really like kind of coaxing

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,330
it's almost like there's there's so much

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,100
out there and people like oh this works

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,070
no that works no this works and then

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,260
what's the right answer there isn't so I

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,520
try to just do what I can and like I

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,100
said talk to people who are in your

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,020
industry talk to other experts that you

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,000
know that you trust that you feel like

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,700
have a good knowledge of a lot of things

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,380
not just as you know and maybe also to

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,540
look at their work and see where they've

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,120
had that success and if they've had

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:58,580
success with a chiropractor and you're

00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:01,430
in direct sales they're working with

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,680
local search in Google Maps and you're

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,450
an online business it's not really the

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,670
same thing so you got to really look at

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,800
exactly like okay this worked for this

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,150
chiropractor I'm also a chiropractor let

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,490
me talk to this guy because he seems to

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,440
be able to work with you know this kind

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,860
of group in this kind of industry really

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,070
well so that's what I say about SEO the

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,590
myth first is really essentially and so

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,030
as you're doing things with the library

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,520
as you're creating posts as you're

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:32,060
creating pages you want like I said keep

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,830
it really simple I also like to unless I

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,540
just uploaded these images just off you

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,000
know kind of off the cuff but these

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,220
image names are like one four five four

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,780
like that's not an image name if I'm

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,150
gonna upload an image and I want good

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,360
SEO I like to rename it with the title

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,950
add a caption the caption will show on

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,660
the image sometimes so usually I'll use

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,560
the alt text or the description instead

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,170
but I'll put like you know woman's hand

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,090
sparkler evening pretty you know

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,920
whatever kinds of words I would like to

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,510
that image to evoke and then when

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,910
someone's searching online they may

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,980
actually find my photo it's a stock

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,540
photo which I paid for however they

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,920
might also find my website through there

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,920
or something so get a question

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,710
never use those on your website ever

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:32,010
Google Images okay

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,840
yeah yeah right your results on your

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:50,250
website

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:50,250
oh just regular right mm-hmm yep okay

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,900
the images right

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,870
okay so you're looking for like an image

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:09,050
of a credit score chart right right this

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,700
is part of that and like I said you

00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:18,230
can't really do that though you can't

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:19,400
really take those images you can search

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,030
for public domain but you have to be

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,309
specific about that there are also so

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,260
many good stock photo companies that are

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:34,070
not paid that are free

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:37,179
does anybody know of unsplash pixels I

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:40,910
actually hasn't even heard of appSumo

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:44,390
appSumo is my favorite every year in

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:47,600
December they have a deposit photos like

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:51,470
deal and it's a hundred images for like

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
29 bucks it's crazy crazy town I buy

00:25:51,470 --> 00:26:02,420
like two or three a year on different

00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:03,920
email addresses yeah yeah yeah the stock

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,880
photo thing is yeah I always just try to

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,040
make that if somebody brings it up

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,080
though I or just mention anyway yes you

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,080
have a question yeah yeah

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:28,830
yes correct now if you've taken a photo

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,840
if it's your photo if it's a stock photo

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,100
I mean you could you could put a you

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,140
know watermark on it if you want but if

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,179
it's if you've taken a photo you always

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,220
want to mark watermark those so that if

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,529
someone does try and take it you

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,570
actually have rights and you can sue if

00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,890
somebody takes your photo the bad thing

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,240
about these photos getting into the

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,740
search results is that someone just can

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,179
take it and they don't know any better

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,940
or they just do it because they know

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,440
they don't care so that's one issue you

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,760
can also disable right-click on your

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,039
site so that no one can actually take

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,360
the photo you can put the watermark on

00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,250
it I mean there's all these kinds of

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,600
things to protect those the photos but

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,730
you don't necessarily want to just get

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,130
into image searches these things will

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,529
come up in regular searches when someone

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,880
searches for a blog post and this this

00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:11,429
is on your blog post but they're

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,169
searching just in general online this is

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,700
going to help that blog post because the

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:17,639
image is associated with that blog post

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,360
so it's kind of more more on the content

00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:30,330
side rather than the image search side

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:31,620
other question yes mm-hmm-hmm you can

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,679
actually credit them either in the alt

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,299
text or the description or the caption

00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,850
and then you can have the caption be

00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,559
really really light gray with you know

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,740
whatever so that's that's one way of

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,029
doing it yeah if you pay for the photos

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,769
though if you're purchasing them through

00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:49,080
you know deposit or something you don't

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:50,490
have to that there's less of that if

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,429
you're paying did they have different

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,049
rules alright so yeah read the fine

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:58,700
print on those things because they can

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,700
get tricky yes question

00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,899
historical okay

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,029
uh-huh

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:20,660
if there yes giving credit is fine

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,070
giving credit is fine it's when you take

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,179
it you don't you just pull it from

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,200
someone's sight maybe it's a picture of

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,370
some of these kids and you're like wow

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,620
this is really great I want it for my

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,850
blog post yeah that kind of or even if

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,350
somebody is taking a foot or like a

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,720
photo like this maybe I paid for this

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,160
one on a stock photo website and it's on

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,630
my blog and you're like wow that's cool

00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,070
I want to use it on my thing and it's

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,650
I've already paid for it but you didn't

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,650
pay for it so yeah then there's an issue

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,220
yes if you're crediting you're better

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,600
off and then if you get a I've had

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,669
people get cease and desist letters even

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,309
after crediting and it's just a matter

00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:56,650
of taking it down they'll send you a

00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:00,070
letter first though if you're in trouble

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:03,470
yes just make sure you're crediting yeah

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,799
mm-hmm wow we just got way off in a

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,620
router oh I'm sorry no my fault sorry

00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:15,870
all right any other questions about SEO

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:17,020
things like that okay anybody bored yet

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,620
[Music]

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:23,210
okay so let's see here we got comments

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:27,490
we're gonna come back to pages in a

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,490
minute I don't think I missed it

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,650
okay so comments these are where you

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,450
have your blog post you've already

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,270
written and people can go in and comment

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,040
on those posts these are going to be all

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,370
the comments for all the posts in the

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,440
entire site so you're gonna have all of

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,340
them listed and you have a couple of

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,530
things here at the top so we have

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:54,380
pending excuse me pending approved spam

00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,690
and trash then you've got also like a

00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:00,650
little hover menu that pops up here for

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,660
you as well if you read the comments and

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:05,090
you're not happy with it or something's

00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,770
wrong with it you can unapprove it or

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,290
you can you know delete it or whatever

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:12,230
let's make it spam this one's already

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,720
approved so if I click on approve it

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,419
gives me the option to approve it so

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,820
just the difference between the two and

00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:22,070
now I have pending oh as 1 and 0 as

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,929
approved you can reply to it so let's

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,490
say you approve it and then you want to

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:26,659
reply to it they give you a little box

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,340
to do that

00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,869
if you were a blogger or you're working

00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,549
for a blogger or you're working for

00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,859
someone who has a blog you want to be

00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,989
replying this is where the engagement

00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:37,460
comes from on your site it's not just

00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:39,649
about social media a lot of people put

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,090
so much stock in social media and your

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:42,349
site is really where your sales happen

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,879
and I try to get people to remember I

00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:45,129
remember that and that's why I think

00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:47,539
WordPress is so important is because

00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:49,779
even if you have social media you need a

00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:52,399
website which is why you're here and

00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,960
this is the engagement you get on your

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,340
website so you don't want to discount

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,229
this or ignore it you want to make sure

00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,239
you're checking those comments even if

00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:00,679
there's spam all the time you still need

00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:02,090
to be checking them once a week once a

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,749
month whatever your routine is and

00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:07,399
replying to them if you get them all

00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:08,710
right and then you can also edit it

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:14,029
really quickly

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,499
maybe they misspelled a word they didn't

00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,149
so we're cool

00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,799
they put a link in maybe you're like I

00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:24,440
don't really want your link in there I

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,289
can just take out your link and just say

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,590
now I don't need that sentence at all

00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:32,720
okay now I can update the comment

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,859
another link is gone you know just

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,830
depending on if you don't want someone

00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:38,899
leaking in your comments or whatever or

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,220
maybe like sometimes the spam comments

00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:42,349
it's really funny sometimes a spammer

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,789
comments are actually really nice and

00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:45,139
they're really sweet and then they have

00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:46,729
all these links in there it's all junkie

00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:50,239
so I just like to lead other links and

00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:51,919
be like oh look there's this sweet but

00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:54,249
you can reply to them you can spam them

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,109
you can trash them if you spam someone

00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:58,999
that you know is a regular spammer on

00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,679
your site you're gonna get them just you

00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:01,789
can you can install things like jetpack

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:03,889
which we'll get to in a few minutes but

00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,749
to help minimize that but you're still

00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,940
going to get them if you spam them once

00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:10,099
they're kind of on a list in your site

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,840
kind of tags that name and then it will

00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,609
kind of show you like we think these

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,169
three are spam you know or whatever so

00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:16,849
kay gives you saves you a little time as

00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:19,159
you go through and you start doing it

00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:21,679
more and more you want to create a

00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,789
routine with your site this is one of

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,340
those things that's going to be on that

00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:26,840
routine and if you have a separate note

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,950
or a separate page of your notebook I'm

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,869
going to tell you things to add to your

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,220
routine this is very important unless

00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:33,769
you're gonna have someone maintain your

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,299
site for you if you don't want to do all

00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:36,559
these things by the end of the time and

00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,539
you that we've listed them and you're

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,739
like I don't want to do this you need to

00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,530
find someone that's gonna do that entire

00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:42,140
list for you ever

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,950
month or every week or whatever it is

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,630
because these are really important

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,700
things and one of them is to respond to

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,410
look at the comments approve or

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,450
disapprove the comments and then reply

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,500
to the ones that are good so that's

00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,090
something you need to be doing every

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,560
single month if not more

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,340
that's kind of a minimum it's once a

00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,250
month so that's on your to-do list for

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:06,030
maintenance of your site oh let me go

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:09,600
back two pages here so pages is very

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:14,490
much like posts they do not have

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,230
categories but they are very much the

00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,660
same as far as what you content you can

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,950
put on them they're more static like I

00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,410
said they don't you can you can

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,910
specifically have a menu of them they're

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,570
not like blog posts that get pushed down

00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:31,320
you know newest on top and you I like to

00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,600
have one page of pages one page of pages

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,120
it's about 20 items usually you can also

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,110
go up here to screen options a lot of

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,290
people know this and you can actually

00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,970
say I want to do 100 pages per section

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,410
so I can see all of them if you're gonna

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,440
have an existing site and you have

00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:49,740
multiple pages of pages like 1 2 3

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,120
whatever you can actually up this 250 or

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,370
whatever it is and you can see all your

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,920
pages in one length you know all in one

00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,110
scroll or you can limit it to you know

00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,700
ten or five and you can have you know

00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,140
fewer that you can look at so it might

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,760
not be so overwhelming so just depends

00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,170
on what you're doing but those screen

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,300
options are at the top of every

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,860
WordPress screen and if you're ever

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,040
curious about them just kind of go into

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,840
them and see what's available it allows

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,390
you to customize the way this looks as

00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,919
well like what's listed here so maybe I

00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:19,950
don't want the number of comments for

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,770
this these pages to be listed I can say

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,630
take off the comments now I just have

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,830
author and date so this is really the

00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,340
where you kind of customize WordPress

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,780
for yourself

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,550
like I said pages and posts are very

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,340
similar they do both have comments I

00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,350
like to turn off the comments for pages

00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,720
just because it's static information I

00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,520
don't really want people saying oh you

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,750
misspelled this one word I'd rather them

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,010
just email me and tell me and then I'll

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,740
fix it I don't need it up there for

00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,000
posterity that I misspelled a word once

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,610
or maybe they want to make this really

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,590
long comment on oh well I saw you speak

00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,490
at such-and-such and you know you put on

00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,840
your resume that

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,220
it was on this year but it was on a

00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,770
different year they want to be

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,470
argumentative whatever so I just turn

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,450
off comments for pages in the settings

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,610
which we'll get to in a few minutes just

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,750
because you want to engage on the post

00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,910
that's where the information is

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,290
constantly changing but the pages is a

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,850
little bit more static and you don't

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,650
want to have to go in there and deal

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:17,820
with people just kind of trashing your

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:21,060
content for now hasten alright um let's

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:27,030
see here where are we oh yes appearance

00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:30,440
any questions about pages no okay yes

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,440
one okay

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:51,860
a page of newsletters PDFs okay it's

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:52,940
unlimited but I like to you can do that

00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,230
yep

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,820
you can have an archive I would actually

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,560
prefer so let me talk a little bit about

00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,640
newsletters for a second I'm gonna go

00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:05,420
into my marketing cat hold on okay

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,340
Marketing hat going forward newsletters

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,260
probably shouldn't be archived as PDFs I

00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,420
like to do them as like something else I

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,960
would do them as blog posts but if you

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:17,420
have old ones I would do them by year so

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,640
I would have a page that's 2018 and only

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,920
put 2018 on it and then I'd have a page

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,480
that's 2017 and only put 2017 on it and

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,230
then I would have a page that says

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,200
archive and it would have a link of 2018

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,760
like a 2019 link at 2017 like a 2013

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,920
link it would have all those links in

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,790
order so that I would do it a little

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,840
differently I've structure it

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,000
differently but I wouldn't just put all

00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,330
of them on one page I would only do one

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,970
year at a time and then as far as you

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,820
know newsletters these days email

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,380
marketing is better and newsletters in

00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,390
that sense you should not put more than

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,830
one thing it's my opinion again you

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,920
should not put more than one thing on an

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:57,020
email so you can send out 20 emails in a

00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,760
month if you feel like you have to but

00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,850
most of the time people can only read

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,080
one to two items per email and usually

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,360
the subject line only gives you the

00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,580
option to kind of write one to two items

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,600
per email you know per subject line so

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,310
that people don't get overwhelming their

00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,810
email don't think oh that's a newsletter

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm gonna take take me 20 minutes to

00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,610
read it I don't have time then they

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,990
never read it

00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:19,580
but if you say upcoming conference and

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,870
discount that's two items upcoming

00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,100
conference and discount you tell them

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,320
about the conference you show them the

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,000
discount they know exactly what's in it

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,340
they can say yes this is for me no it's

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,320
not read it or delete it and then you

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,980
send another email the next week and you

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,650
say conference was great you know

00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,300
pictures of conference okay you know so

00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,800
you're really like simplifying it rather

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,870
than having a huge newsletter at the end

00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,640
of the month with 50 items in it which

00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,780
gives you those PDFs I know you have the

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,050
archive but I'm saying that going

00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,050
forward

00:37:48,960 --> 00:38:03,240
yeah the archives you would do one year

00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:05,130
at a time one page mm-hmm yep that would

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
be there's just there's a little button

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:10,250
in the page well I can show you that in

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,650
a minute okay let's talk about a theme

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,819
because themes are really important and

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,309
it's pretty much how your whole sites

00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:18,750
gonna be built on this if you switch

00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:20,010
your theme you can switch your theme a

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,460
lot of people don't think you can but

00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,809
you can and it's a very big pain if

00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,790
you've built with one theme and then you

00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:29,010
try to switch your theme it can be a bit

00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,599
of an annoyance because different themes

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,369
have different ways of doing things and

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,680
it can mess up your site make it look

00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,300
funny so you want to try and do this and

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,760
what we call in a staging site or

00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:44,339
offline I'm a cowboy so I could live

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,950
everyone can hate me if they want but I

00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,180
try and live a lot so that means I just

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,140
go in there start changing stuff and I

00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,630
don't care how it looks for a couple

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,490
hours and then I've done and it's fine

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,589
so but you really want to try and do

00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,200
staging a lot of the hosting companies

00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:59,640
allow staging sites so you can call your

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,710
hosting company or talk to them a chat

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,960
and say how do I do a staging site

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,309
they'll help you do that you'll fix your

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,589
staging site to the way you want it to

00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:09,299
look and then they'll help you push they

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:11,400
can help you push your staging site live

00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:13,079
so that way you're not messing up your

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,119
current site where customers are coming

00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,119
and visiting and trying to buy stuff and

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,069
all that don't be a cowboy there's a

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,150
song about that don't let your mom and

00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:23,460
don't let your boys go out to be Cowboys

00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,410
or whatever all right um

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,790
so themes not all things are created

00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:31,430
equal I like paid themes the reason I

00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:34,530
like paid things is cuz typically

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:37,760
typically there's more support and more

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:40,260
of a community around these paid themes

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,630
creative market a lot of people you know

00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,220
creative market it's the online theme

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,630
and plug-in and they have all this

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,740
creative stuff and like people sell

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:52,109
themes and fonts and images and image

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,780
packs and font packs and brushes for

00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:58,530
Photoshop and it's literally a creative

00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,089
market they have a lot of themes but a

00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,520
lot of the themes I've seen from them

00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:04,830
from clients that have purchased

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,510
they're not my fav they're just not they

00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,490
don't always take the best practices

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,870
into consideration sometimes people are

00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,100
just whipping them up for themselves and

00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,200
then deciding to sell them and they're

00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,270
not like all coated correctly so

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,330
sometimes it can be a little hit or miss

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:20,280
there so just be careful with that like

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:23,370
I said again not all themes are created

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,510
equal it's worth saying twice you want

00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,280
to make sure you're looking for one

00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:29,880
that's vetted talk to other people about

00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,920
what themes they use and make sure that

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,100
you're finding one that's best for your

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,720
industry sometimes people have a theme

00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,970
that works really well for online shops

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,290
like I said an example before your

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,410
chiropractor or that's not really gonna

00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,760
work or you're a publicist or your web

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,930
designer that's not necessarily gonna be

00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,160
the best for you because you don't need

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,670
the cart you don't need all that stuff

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,400
so it may be good to talk to people in

00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,750
your industry and then ask for

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,830
recommendations like I said like talk to

00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,360
people in your industry though and a lot

00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,960
of people will shy away from oh well I'm

00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,070
not gonna talk to the other

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,890
chiropractors because they're my

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,240
competition well there's a lot of really

00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,520
good things they might know they could

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,530
say hey I work with children and babies

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,990
and you work with adults you know over

00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,250
50 we have a great synergy here we don't

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,170
do the same thing but we do the same

00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,370
thing also let me help you with some of

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,410
the stuff I've learned and you can help

00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,490
them so always try and talk to people in

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,330
your industry even if they feel like

00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,330
competition yes

00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,349
so mm-hmm

00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:36,530
so the credits for themes and theme

00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:38,780
authors are typically in the code and if

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,070
you have Chrome or or you know Firefox

00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,050
or whatever you're using you can right

00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,570
click and click inspect and sometimes

00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,010
you can find it our view source and

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,470
sometimes you can find their names at

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,910
the top of the code it's a little more

00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:54,040
it's a little harder to do that there's

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:57,290
actually a chrome plug-in called WP

00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,300
reveal or something like that and it

00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,400
actually shows you what theme that that

00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,930
site is running it's just a plug-in on

00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,280
Chrome so you can just use the plug-in

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,720
it might be WordPress theme finder I'm

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,800
not sure there's they've named they have

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,780
a couple of them but for there's one

00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,970
that's in chrome and you can type in

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,280
like WordPress theme in chrome plugins

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,050
and they'll actually you can download to

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,119
your chrome and it will actually go to a

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,060
website and it will say this site is not

00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,680
running WordPress it'll know if it's

00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,180
running WordPress and if it is running

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,609
WordPress it'll tell you what theme and

00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,250
what plugins it's using not all of them

00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:34,099
but some of them some themes are custom

00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,320
and if they're customized enough and

00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:38,030
that person was a good you know they

00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,800
knew enough about themes to change the

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,990
name and stuff like that customize it

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,280
it'll just say custom theme by Jim or

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,900
whatever and you will never know what

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,320
theme it was built off of originally if

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,730
unless they built it from scratch to so

00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,020
you can know what themes are and what

00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,760
the plugins are that each site is using

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:56,230
if you're using Chrome and you look up

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,230
that chrome WP plugin

00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,559
the reviews of themes are all on those

00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:08,480
platforms so creative market has reviews

00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,160
there you if you find a theme you like

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,349
you can type in the fee name in Google

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,079
and then type reviews and you'll find

00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:17,530
other places that have reviewed it

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,369
there's things like trust radius and

00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,010
there's another one I can't think of the

00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:24,920
name at the moment but those I think

00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:28,520
it's apt trust or something and they do

00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:31,789
reviews as well but you know I'll be

00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:34,599
honest with you I for certain companies

00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:37,280
and I get paid to do those reviews so

00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,200
it's I use the products and I'm giving

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,030
you an honest review but I don't know

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:47,059
that everyone is I only review the

00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:49,099
products I've actually used there are

00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:50,839
bestsellers like for a while there was a

00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:53,420
really really good seller on a creative

00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:55,490
market or theme for us one of those for

00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,549
a really long time and ended up being

00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,480
one of the worst themes in history it

00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:00,920
was just one of those things that

00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,930
everybody just kind of glommed on to it

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,460
in the beginning and everybody was using

00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,160
it so there became this community around

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,690
it but then it started breaking hardcore

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,130
there were so many issues with it and

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,240
people had to start ditching it and it's

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,470
still one of the best selling themes

00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,900
just because it had so many sales in the

00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,430
beginning so I'm gonna talk about which

00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,869
themes where you can go to get a couple

00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,890
themes let me go down to my ex slide

00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:22,940
here actually it's it's all mine

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:26,839
actually I think it's down here

00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:28,069
somewhere hold on I tried to put a

00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:31,250
couple of these slides together here we

00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:34,339
go these are the two that I recommend I

00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,230
don't I've I've vetted them I vetted

00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,000
both of them actually if you're looking

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,400
for just a nice theme that you can

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,140
customize yourself and it can be really

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,880
you like you like the way it looks on

00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,930
their website you like the way that it

00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,760
looks you know how they've already

00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,099
designed it and you're just gonna go in

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,910
and change some colors maybe blue chic

00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:52,579
is a good one

00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:54,140
it's it's feminine themes but I've

00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:56,299
actually used them for guys websites and

00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,720
like mortgage brokers and things like

00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:59,480
that

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,950
real realtor's and stuff they look

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,289
feminine because of the colors if you

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,760
change the colors you have a guy site I

00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:06,890
mean it's not not hard to change the

00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:13,380
colors but blue chic is one of them and

00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:22,650
I'll actually put this link for you

00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:25,920
in the chat so let me pull this up it's

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:29,579
blue Sheik calm I put it in the chat for

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,839
you guys on my website and then elegant

00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:38,690
themes is the one that I use exclusively

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:40,799
now and this one is actually a builder

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,519
and I'm going to talk about builders

00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:46,140
tomorrow but this is specifically a

00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:47,940
builder and the reason I like builders

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,489
is because it's like using building

00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,229
blocks and then you create a really cool

00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:54,119
theme with it and you can reuse those

00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:57,089
blocks all over the place even in other

00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,289
other websites you're doing so that's

00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:00,180
the reason I like builders if you do

00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:01,890
something in let's say blue chic and you

00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,670
really like it you'd have to essentially

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,470
copy the entire site and then put it

00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,819
onto another server to kind of say I

00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,789
want to use this like all this cool

00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:13,559
stuff I did and I want to use it again

00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:15,269
but what I like to do with with Divi is

00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:17,279
that you have these blocks you make that

00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:18,690
are really cool and so you can use bits

00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:21,269
and pieces of different sites you've

00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,920
made all over the web rather than having

00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:25,410
to start with the whole thing you did

00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,180
and then try and recreate pieces it's

00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:36,140
really more modular it gives you a

00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:38,549
little more flexibility that way okay

00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,619
customizing your theme that's what we

00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,089
have done here under customize so I'm

00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,710
just stepping through the dashboards

00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:47,339
everybody kind of following along too a

00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,700
little bit customizer this is just the

00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:52,619
default WordPress 2017 theme so there's

00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,809
nothing fancy about this one but it does

00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:58,109
allow you to now this customizer allows

00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:00,210
you to do different color schemes I can

00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:04,200
choose the color I want see how my March

00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:07,979
22 March 9th is changing color as I move

00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,599
this slider I like how they have the

00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:11,009
dark theme and the light theme they just

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,200
kind of pick the colors for you with the

00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:16,380
black and white and then the header text

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:24,779
color I'll make it red see WP 101 is

00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:27,220
changing so there's that and I can do

00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:31,270
things like change the header image

00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,770
I can you know change the way my menus

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,049
look this one doesn't have any menus at

00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:38,890
the moment it's just kind of the

00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:39,970
standard site I have my widgets which

00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,520
we'll talk about in a minute

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,250
and so this customizer really just gives

00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,140
me you know information on how I can

00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,660
customize this theme this particular

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,299
theme if you use blue chic they use the

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,829
customizer so all their fonts and all

00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:55,720
their colors and all that stuff is all

00:47:53,829 --> 00:48:00,099
listed in this section under customize

00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,650
and if you use Divi Divi has its own

00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:05,319
customizer piece doesn't use the

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,180
customizer necessarily but it has its

00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:09,760
own customizer section and you would

00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,559
fill in that as you're building a page

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,510
rather than having it off to the side is

00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:15,549
a separate section so you would actually

00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,960
be on a page working your page and you'd

00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:18,849
be changing fonts and changing colors

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,829
and changing sizes of fonts and all that

00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,200
so that's another kind of added

00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:24,790
advantage of a builder and if you're

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,440
interested in more about builders I'm

00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,319
gonna be demoing like six of them

00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,430
tomorrow in my class so it's I don't

00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:31,569
want to get into a lot of it now just

00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,579
because I don't want to take up the time

00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:35,140
for this but I am gonna be going into

00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:37,990
like six different ones that's showing

00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,839
you demos on all of them Divi being the

00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:44,920
last one and the best you can also add

00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:47,319
your custom CSS here into the customizer

00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,450
and I use a lot of custom CSS and my

00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:52,140
stuff so this is a really important

00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,140
section for me

00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:02,080
okay widgets let's look at these these

00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,000
are available in your sidebars and if

00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,190
you're using a theme like blue Sheik

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,230
blue Sheik does still use sidebars to

00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,490
its advantage actually and if you have

00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,230
just the one of the WordPress themes

00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,060
from the repository a lot of them use

00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,950
sidebars as well

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,760
I've personally gotten away from them

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:20,650
except in certain circumstances for

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,990
creating like sidebar menus where you're

00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,570
in one page you can kind of see the

00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:26,920
content change almost like a like a

00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,010
membership site you might be in or

00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,750
whatever kind of like Amazon does but

00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,070
their stuff they have like a menu on the

00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,570
side and the content in the middle

00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,550
changes but necessarily the header and

00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,290
stuff doesn't so I use sidebars for that

00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,580
kind of stuff but I don't use them

00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,800
necessarily the way that they were used

00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,110
originally for blogs now if you have a

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,090
blog having your you know like this has

00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,500
here the search recent posts recent

00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,540
comments that kind of stuff on the

00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:56,950
sidebar is important you can also add

00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:59,560
the author archive part see here like a

00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,360
text thing here so you could add this

00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,910
and put your author information maybe

00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,500
put a picture of you or whatever you see

00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:08,290
that on probably a lot of blogs if it

00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,880
they're specifically a blogger that kind

00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,130
of information is good for sidebars but

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,060
if you're doing a regular website

00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,310
sidebars aren't really something we're

00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,680
using at the moment as far as what I

00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:23,110
would consider best practices again my

00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,400
opinion so don't go crazy but and when

00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,620
you're using a builder you can actually

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,260
build sidebars on any page you want to

00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:33,820
anywhere you want to so it gives you a

00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:35,080
little more flexibility okay menus let's

00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:40,140
talk about those these are really

00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:44,220
important all of your pages posts

00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,220
let me type a new one here

00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:51,430
and categories are gonna be listed here

00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:55,900
now if I had cat if I had some

00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:57,520
categories excuse me they'd be here and

00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,170
you can see the one is right here so if

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,840
I wanted to link to one of my categories

00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:04,630
on my menu I just check the little box

00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:08,110
add to menu and now it's one of my menu

00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,810
items I can also add my pages if I have

00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,720
my about

00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:14,300
home I contact all those pages listed

00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,790
here I check all the boxes here's my

00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,330
home page and my sample page add them to

00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,370
my menu

00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:23,510
and now I can decide where I want them

00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:25,820
to go I can also add custom links maybe

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,920
I want to link out to another site

00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,660
that's you know completely you know

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,490
somewhere else maybe it's my mary kay

00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:36,170
site or my vendor site or whatever I can

00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,660
put that link in here and type whatever

00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:45,140
text I want does anybody heard of

00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:48,110
calendly it's a online booking free so

00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,660
if anybody wants to talk with me one on

00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,340
one you know like after this conference

00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,420
is over kind of thing I know like I

00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,220
really need your help I need your up

00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,460
some advice they can go on my website

00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:03,890
and there's a button that says let's

00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:07,970
chat and it goes to calais comm board /

00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:10,790
Elizabeth pantalone Ford / 15 minutes

00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:15,500
and this link I'm gonna add this to the

00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:18,710
menu and we're gonna say display

00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,550
location is the top menu now let's see

00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:21,850
what this looks like

00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,850
Oh

00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:34,990
and here's my menu right and if I click

00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:37,810
on let's chat it takes me to Cowley and

00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:40,180
you can see the availability I have that

00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:42,970
makes sense so this is an external link

00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,560
that I'm using but it's something that

00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,080
it's part of my ecosystem of my

00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,190
marketing and how I run my business so I

00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,500
recommend that if you don't have a

00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,720
calendar link sign up for one it's free

00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,460
you get one event it's what this is

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,010
called an event you get one event for

00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,410
free and I love it and it's one of those

00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,710
external links you can add to your menu

00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,730
makes it really cool and professional

00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,380
did a little different than a contact

00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:09,010
page I still use a contact page but I

00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:11,440
also use this as well you can have

00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:14,410
multiple menu items created from

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,450
different areas so maybe there's a top

00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,460
menu and a footer menu and a you know

00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,890
like a secondary menu at the very very

00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,720
top and little tiny words whatever that

00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,700
is I'll show an example of one that has

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:30,130
a couple of different menus locations

00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:32,260
this website here has a menu here the

00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:35,230
main menu in black and then it has like

00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,580
a secondary menu at the top where you

00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,670
can get the new patient downloads and

00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,350
then you can book an appointment this

00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:44,080
these are two different menus in the

00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:46,420
backend of this WordPress site and then

00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,880
down here at the bottom we have another

00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,920
menu which has all of her same stuff at

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,110
the top but now it's here at the bottom

00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,480
as well and then down here - so we got

00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,920
menus all over the place on this one and

00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,530
those are all separate menus in

00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,320
WordPress dashboard and it says right

00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:05,470
here create another menu you do another

00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,990
one here will do secondary so you can

00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:10,300
see the difference and then it will show

00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:13,150
me I have two options here top menu

00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,680
primary secondary I can do a third one I

00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,750
can do a footer I could do whatever it

00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,060
is and then there's in your theme it'll

00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:21,550
tell you where you can place those so

00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,130
right here it says display location your

00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,570
theme will add more to this area and say

00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,760
there's a footer section you can add

00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,920
this menu - or there's a secondary

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,690
section you can add this menu - I like

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,130
to name my menus the place they're

00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,560
supposed to go so I don't forget which

00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:38,290
one is which so if it says primary or

00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,580
top I name it top or primary if it says

00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,590
footer

00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,790
I named it footer if it says secondary I

00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,130
named it secondary then I know exactly

00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:46,930
where that menu goes and what I need to

00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:50,830
put on it you know depends on where it

00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:52,660
goes and then manage locations again

00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:55,210
like I said you'll have these added if

00:54:52,660 --> 00:55:00,750
you have a theme that adds them so it'll

00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:00,750
be more than just the two here all right

00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:07,180
let's go to the header and like I said

00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,550
I'm just stepping through WordPress so

00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,920
if you see different weird things that's

00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,840
something a plug-in or theme is done so

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,810
it's not necessarily just WordPress

00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:21,010
this is a fresh WordPress install as of

00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:23,830
Friday so last Friday so it's just kind

00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:25,360
of baby baby WordPress this is the

00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:27,880
header and when I clicked header it

00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,640
actually took me to the customizer for

00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:35,770
this theme so it's just telling me I can

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:39,280
I can add a video with a YouTube URL I

00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:41,560
can add a different header image and

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,800
that's gonna change this little picture

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,540
here with the little cactus guy so

00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,920
that's where the header just takes me

00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:54,630
back to the customizer for this theme

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:56,700
and then the editor this is a fun one

00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,810
don't touch it

00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,770
you're a beginner don't touch this see

00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:03,910
this see this box this is your you know

00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,730
those things you put on your cabinets

00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:09,550
for your kids or pets right this is one

00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,020
of those it's the you can't get in here

00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,300
but if you really figure it out and you

00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,350
click I understand all right then I

00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,320
guess you can get in the trash if you

00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:19,270
want and this is really literally all

00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,850
the code of your site right here in

00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:24,760
WordPress this is all the code for this

00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:27,100
theme I can also drop this down and look

00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,410
at different themes the other themes

00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,970
that are here I can edit those this is

00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:34,480
only to be touched if you really know

00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,770
what you're doing Eric you don't even

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,960
want to add anything here if you don't

00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,760
have to and if you get into this spot

00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,810
and you're like oh no I got in there how

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,780
did I get in there you can just go out

00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:46,060
just go to a different sidebar peace but

00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,580
if you mess up something the only way

00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:52,270
that it's going to be saved as if you

00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,019
hit this update so just know that you do

00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,489
have a safety

00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:58,149
if you get in here and your cats like oh

00:56:54,489 --> 00:57:02,079
my gosh what happened you can just go

00:56:58,149 --> 00:57:03,509
back in here and okay I'm not going to

00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:07,419
touch anything I'm going back to themes

00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:09,759
leave that page okay I didn't have to

00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:12,909
save it it's good we're good crisis

00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:14,079
averted so you don't have to touch that

00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:16,059
if you don't know if you lost you know

00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,839
what you're doing but it's just know

00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:21,339
that it's there just like pluck just

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,099
like themes plugins are not created

00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:26,499
equal either paid ones I feel like are

00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:28,239
better than some of the free ones there

00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:29,559
are free ones in the repository are

00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,630
better than any other free ones you're

00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:34,509
gonna get so if you go to the WordPress

00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:36,789
repository which is wordpress.org and

00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:38,289
you look up plugins it's the same thing

00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:40,329
you're gonna get if you try to add a new

00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:43,209
plug-in in your dashboard this is the

00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:45,729
repository as well so I like to look in

00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:48,969
here first before I go out and venture

00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:50,380
into paid or other free world because it

00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:53,079
can get a little squirrely with some of

00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:54,549
the code that's out there you also need

00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:56,709
to know that plugins will interfere with

00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:59,469
your theme so that's why you need to

00:57:56,709 --> 00:58:02,169
pick a really good solid theme and then

00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:04,539
usually what you can do is type in your

00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:09,269
name of your theme for example Divi and

00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:12,339
you could say Divi compatibility Yoast

00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:14,349
in Google and it will tell you if Divi

00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:18,069
is compatible with Yoast Divi

00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:19,209
compatibility smush and you can put

00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:20,559
WordPress if it's Google doesn't

00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:22,359
understand you but most the time they do

00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,709
and they'll tell you some articles

00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:25,119
somebody wrote about how Divi is

00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:28,329
compatible with Smosh or if there are

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,380
issues so just keep that in mind that if

00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:31,749
you're gonna have a theme you want to

00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,549
pick a good theme first and then you go

00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:35,589
with plugins a lot of times things like

00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:36,639
WooCommerce and those kind of big big

00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:38,469
plugins like that

00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,509
they're pretty compatible with like 90%

00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:42,759
of themes out there but there are a few

00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:44,919
that they're not compatible with you can

00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:47,380
also look on the plug-in website to see

00:58:44,919 --> 00:58:49,359
if they're compatible with the theme

00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,769
that you're going with so before you

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,779
kind of do anything you can kind of

00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:55,539
check them out make sure everything's

00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,579
good again creative markets not the

00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:59,649
be-all end-all with it don't just go

00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:02,019
there look in the repository first and

00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:04,630
then start searching elsewhere

00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:06,319
don't put too many plugins in your

00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:08,690
plugins section how

00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,309
plugins what's the number of plugins the

00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:14,359
highest number we got here plugins in

00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:22,519
your plug-in area how many you got what

00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:23,319
you get 25 23 27 that's exactly exactly

00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:28,670
right

00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:34,069
81 no way are you serious for real

00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:40,910
who said 81 are you for real but you're

00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:44,809
like okay good alright so that's my

00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:49,400
point here their site is probably kind

00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:50,509
of slow maybe just a little you might be

00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,670
able to make a cup of coffee while it

00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:58,549
loads but I like to stay under 10 how

00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:02,630
many people think that's impossible it's

00:59:58,549 --> 01:00:03,529
not it's totally doable and the reason

01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:07,400
it's totally doable

01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:09,410
is because hold on one second okay we're

01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,880
good the reason it's totally doable is

01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:14,349
because you if you pick a really good

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,150
theme you don't need 50 million plugins

01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:18,769
okay so that's why I like builders so

01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,289
much is because they eliminate the need

01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:22,940
for having so many plugins they have a

01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:25,039
lot of plugins already kind of baked

01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,329
into the theme and yes a lot of people

01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,739
like going with slows my site down or

01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:30,769
whatever there's other ways you can

01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:36,589
reduce your site speed like images and

01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:37,940
image size yes yes there are some must

01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:39,410
have plugins and I'm gonna show them to

01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:43,549
you right now thank you for the segue

01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:44,630
idea they would be I guess I didn't put

01:00:43,549 --> 01:00:48,859
my slides and it's good order as I

01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:51,499
thought here are what I like for site

01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:53,449
setup you may not or you may need them

01:00:51,499 --> 01:00:55,549
all I don't know and remember I am

01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:57,619
putting these slides up on my website as

01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:58,969
soon as I'm done with this so over lunch

01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:00,380
so don't if you don't want to write it

01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:02,329
all down don't worry it'll have it

01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:06,289
you'll be on that side I linked and I'll

01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:07,420
show the link at the end too so these

01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:11,299
are the ones I like

01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,949
duplicate post I love this one because

01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:16,249
sometimes you make a really cool post

01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:18,440
and you're like I like this I want to

01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:19,640
use this again but you don't have to

01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,090
recreate it over and over and over right

01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,420
every

01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:26,390
you opposed so this will actually allow

01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,890
you to duplicate it with one click and I

01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,470
do love this this poet this plugin

01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:33,110
wordfence is one of my favorites it's

01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:34,820
just a good layer of security there's so

01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,960
many security plugins out there there's

01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,970
so much you need to know about security

01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,110
with WordPress so if there's a secure is

01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:43,150
there a security thing this weekend

01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:45,830
security talk they may know

01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:48,950
okay if not talk to something that

01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:50,450
happiness bar about security I actually

01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,490
do what's called like what I like to

01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,410
call like a minimal security which means

01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:57,560
I do the bare minimum but I haven't had

01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:59,120
any site tacked either so I do like what

01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,830
a normal person would be able to handle

01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,360
not what a techie person would be able

01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:05,300
to like oh I know all these cool things

01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:08,690
so I try to keep it really simple for

01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,040
average users but wordfence is one of my

01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,270
favorites it just kind of it will send

01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,650
you emails if it thinks something's

01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,170
going wrong if it's think something's

01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:16,220
funky something's like happening where

01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,960
somebody's trying to log in to your site

01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,210
a lot like multiple times over and over

01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,100
it gives you really good notification so

01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,450
if you do setup wordfence make sure you

01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,310
set it up all the way like go through

01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,990
all the prompts and make sure you put

01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:29,360
your email in for the emails yes they

01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:31,730
get annoying but yes your site is being

01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,680
more protected than without it smooshes

01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,200
another one I love because image sizes

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,290
are out of this world they can make your

01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,580
site go so slow and if you're on good

01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,590
internet but your client isn't or

01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:44,990
they're loading on a phone this is just

01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,730
way easier just to have smush and have

01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:49,840
it optimize your images automatically

01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,840
every time you upload an image

01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:56,000
ninja forms I met the guys at ninja

01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:59,390
forms at Birmingham I spoke there and

01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,040
they are so awesome they have the best

01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,900
form product I know a lot of people like

01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,510
gravity and a lot of people like contact

01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,460
form 7 and a lot of people like again my

01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,590
opinion so throw it out if you don't

01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,420
like it but ninja forms is one of the

01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:13,250
easiest to use they also have a style

01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,920
extra piece that you could like a plugin

01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:18,320
you can add to ninja forms for styles

01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,790
and layouts and you can really make a

01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,400
lot of customized forms that are really

01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:24,020
beautiful they also allow the anything

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,990
that comes into your website that

01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:30,350
through a form get saved into their

01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:32,930
plugin and that means if your form stops

01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:33,799
working or your email is going to spam

01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:36,499
and you're never

01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:38,390
getting those contacts they're all

01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:40,849
sitting there under submissions in your

01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:43,339
website so you're never actually losing

01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:45,410

because my husband's always been really

01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:27,709

01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:12,979
a while should yeah I had to get a job

01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:15,559
I'm just doing this part-time now she's

01:05:12,979 --> 01:05:18,469
like but you were right and I said what

01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:19,910
do you mean she said a couple months ago

01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:21,859
like two months ago

01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:23,439
after she'd already quit god no you know

01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:26,479
another job only doing this part-time

01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:31,119
she said I went to my website and I

01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:35,479
found 60 leads for business

01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:37,729
over the last year and a half in her

01:05:35,479 --> 01:05:39,720
contact form that she never got in her

01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:42,970
email address

01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,990
sixty over a year do you know how many

01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,309
though she could probably could have

01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:47,619
converted and then those people would

01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:50,920
have told people and then that's so much

01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:52,299
business even just the 60 and its Home

01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,680
Staging so that time that's passed

01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:54,759
though those people aren't looking for

01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,240
that anymore those holes at homes are

01:05:54,759 --> 01:05:59,589
sold things are moved on right she lost

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,740
all that business because she wasn't

01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:04,450
checking her contact form so put this on

01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,910
your to-do list of like maintenance

01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:09,880
right every single month you need to

01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:12,579
send yourself a test on your form every

01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,859
single month put it in your calendar do

01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,049
it every month I have had so many people

01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:18,999
even my own clients where we test the

01:06:17,049 --> 01:06:20,710
forum's every month for them and they

01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:22,420
say I didn't get it sometimes it goes to

01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,369
spam and I'm like check your spam make

01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,900
sure you're marking it is not spammy or

01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:28,390
those kind of things sometimes filters

01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,829
change and all that other times they're

01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,460
like oh yeah I changed my email I forgot

01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:34,539
to tell you well that would be good and

01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,130
they change their email I go in and

01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:37,809
change it forms working fine now

01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:40,839
sometimes the forms just don't work they

01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:42,069
just they just break so you have to

01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:43,630
check those every single month or you

01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:44,589
could be in that position of that woman

01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,239
and I don't want anybody to be in the

01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:48,640
position it was horrible so ninja forum

01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,289
is one of my favorites very easy to use

01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:54,009
huge community behind it they have a

01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:56,230
great information packet I guess like a

01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:57,730
website where they have all their you

01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:59,170
know it's like knowledge base where it's

01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,239
like all their directions on how to fill

01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:02,829
everything in and how to set it all up

01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:07,170
so if you go to their website like their

01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:10,900
documentation it's really really good I

01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:12,489
like to have a kasher and plug-in

01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:16,749
caching plug-in in my site

01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:18,759
so hummingbird is one w3 fastest cache

01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:21,369
is another one how many of you are on

01:07:18,759 --> 01:07:23,920
site ground anybody on site ground say

01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:31,089
crowd has their own so you can actually

01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:32,960
just go in it's SG optimizer yes is that

01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:37,069
a little too advanced for

01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,280
so I would again my opinion nobody go

01:07:37,069 --> 01:07:42,170
and like mug me in the parking lot okay

01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,170
caching and what I kind of simplify it

01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:47,480
down to is that the the websites that we

01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,130
go to or all have tons of images and

01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,930
tons of text and all that stuff right so

01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:52,069
what your browser does every time you go

01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,410
to a website is they take a picture of

01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:55,940
it and it says okay I got a good picture

01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:58,730
of it I don't need another picture for a

01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,770
while until the website says hey rather

01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:03,140
yeah I updated something so you need

01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:05,240
another picture so your website just

01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,309
kind of keeps showing you parts of that

01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,690
picture every time or your browser shows

01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:09,829
you parts of that website every time you

01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,180
go to it so it doesn't have to load

01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:12,020
everything all over again and all over

01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,690
again and all over again

01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:17,150
but when you're working on your site and

01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,500
you've changed something and you go to

01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,660
the browser and you don't see any of

01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,699
those changes that's because your

01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:25,339
browser is like dude I just got a

01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:27,739
picture last week like I'm good but

01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:29,929
you're like no no browser listen I just

01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:31,609
updated I need you to get a new picture

01:08:29,929 --> 01:08:33,710
so what the Cassiar does it kind of

01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:36,319
clears all that out and says to the

01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,400
browser's yeah we don't have any

01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,989
pictures here so you're gonna have to

01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,429
get another one and so then it gets

01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:43,569
another one now you have a new updated

01:08:40,429 --> 01:08:43,569
picture that makes sense

01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:49,009
that's my simplified version so

01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,100
basically that's what it does but it

01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:53,929
allows your your website to be faster if

01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,779
you don't have any changes going on a

01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:58,339
lot and it allows your site to get those

01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:59,929
changes and clear them out every time

01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:06,170
you kind of you know make major major

01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:07,640
changes Google XML sitemaps that is I

01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,250
like to use that because it's good for

01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,630
your SEO and you need to just make sure

01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,989
you set it up correctly they have like

01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:16,640
step-by-step instructions on there and

01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:19,120
you can upload that to like Google

01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:23,060
Analytics and stuff like that as well

01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,630
Yoast is on here does everybody have SSL

01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,980
on their site the little green lock

01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:32,449
anybody not have that's a cell on their

01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:33,980
site not sure so SSL is extremely

01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:36,949
extremely extremely extremely extremely

01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:38,719
extremely important and the reason I say

01:09:36,949 --> 01:09:40,520
that is because Google does not like you

01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,109
and they will push your site to the

01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,850
bottom of even whatever search it's on

01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:46,739
sale yes on page ten you'll go to page

01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:48,989
100 because they don't want you to not

01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:50,659
SSL they you have to have SSL if Google

01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:53,609
is gonna say gotcha

01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:56,610
so it's a mandatory thing they

01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:58,619
instituted a couple years ago so what I

01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:01,889
like to do is how you set ground

01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:07,199
personally because they use um what's it

01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:08,880
called SSL what's the one called let's

01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,980
encrypt yeah I kind of think it I could

01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,630
see the picture is a little guy goodness

01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,559
the other word it's called let's encrypt

01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:16,829
and it's free

01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:19,469
so it comes with your hosting now if

01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:20,940
you're on GoDaddy no problem with that

01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:22,920
they're gonna charge you for us a sell

01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:26,369
and it's gonna be expensive as you go

01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:28,800
forward so look for a hosting company

01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:32,280
that uses let's encrypt or that includes

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:35,340
SSL with your package because you don't

01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,440
want to be without it and you want your

01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,360
site to show up what a lot of browsers

01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,030
have started doing is if you go to a

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,619
site that does not have SSL you go to

01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:45,539
your site all the time because you're

01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:49,139
working on it you're gonna see your site

01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:50,880
probably if I go to your site I might

01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:52,860
not even see it cuz Chrome actually has

01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,880
started putting up that little if you

01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,349
see that little thing that says Oh

01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,360
proceed at your own risk

01:10:55,349 --> 01:10:59,340
this is a dangerous site they may be

01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,679
trying to take your money and your

01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,599
social security number and it's just you

01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,150
know your chiropractor site they don't

01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:07,860
have SSL so that's what that's trying to

01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:10,349
do is keep you from going to a bad site

01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:13,070
then the SSL is gonna kind of tell

01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:15,119
Google hey I'm okay I'm real I'm legit

01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:17,010
even though it's like super simple to

01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,800
install and really easy so you're not

01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,880
sure about it talk to your host and if

01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,079
you're not sure about it you can see

01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,980
somebody at the happiness bar and

01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:24,630
they'll probably help you be able to

01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,340
like figure that out

01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:30,380
logging into your host do you have a

01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,380
question okay

01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:35,340
yeah it's in your hosting so you'd have

01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,190
to go to your hosting you log in to your

01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:39,239
hosting and look for security or SSL or

01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:42,510
something like that and then there'll be

01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:44,249
some information there if you go to the

01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:45,449
Happiness bar or whatever just tell them

01:11:44,249 --> 01:11:46,860
like show them what hosting you're using

01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:47,880
because some people know other hosting

01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,369
is better like I'm really good with

01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,539
SiteGround because I know it really well

01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:54,210
if you're using Bluehost or something

01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:56,309
else don't know like you can switch if

01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,449
you want but you know there's other

01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:59,489
people that are more familiar with other

01:11:57,449 --> 01:12:00,600
hosting types but I'm I'm really good

01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,740
with site cracks that's what I use

01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,690
if you're interested in that I could

01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,100
show you my account or whatever but yeah

01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,630
you just have to kind of fun you know

01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,270
hunt around in there and find it because

01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:12,510
sometimes it's buried all right um

01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:14,550
advanced access manager oh I'm sorry

01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:16,110
SSL when you put your SSL in sometimes

01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,780
your website doesn't understand that

01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:20,850
it's there so I use real simple SSL

01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,980
plug-in to make sure that my website

01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:26,220
knows my SSL is existing and it's there

01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:28,110
and I also if you're excited before you

01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:30,990
put SSL in like you made your site you

01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:33,570
did not have SSL you add SSL and now

01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:34,830
you're like your site's like I can't

01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,960
show you this page and I can't show you

01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,120
this page and that page blocked then

01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:42,180
there's a thing called secure or SSL

01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,160
insecure content fixer and that just

01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,630
kind of goes in and fixes all the images

01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,220
and all the little things that are

01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:50,130
loaded into your site that may not have

01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:52,050
a gotten that SSL memo and so it kind of

01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:53,580
just makes sure that that's all kosher

01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:56,340
there and makes everybody on the same

01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,540
level so that nothing gets blocked and

01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:59,790
you can see everything you're supposed

01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,200
to see advanced access manager I

01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:05,130
remember I told you about the site that

01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,870
got messed up yesterday I went in put an

01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:10,260
advanced access manager and now she

01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:12,420
cannot post or publish anything she is

01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:14,370
locked out so this helps you to kind of

01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,530
limit users from doing things you don't

01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:20,310
want them to do maybe you want your

01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:22,440
editors to be able to delete other

01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:23,910
people's posts and maybe publish other

01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:27,060
people's posts but they can't publish

01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:28,530
their own so you can like even do that

01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,510
kind of stuff like make it really

01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:31,980
complicated and be like oh you can do

01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,240
this but you can't you know that kind of

01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,970
stuff you can even give people

01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:38,430
individual tasks like someone can only

01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:39,900
go in and do comments and that's it they

01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:41,970
can't see anything else they can only

01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:44,610
administer comments like approve

01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:49,430
unapproved and like reply or whatever so

01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:52,250
you can get real fancy with it okay

01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:56,730
let's see here

01:13:52,250 --> 01:14:00,380
settings okay we're in plugins

01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:02,220
okay we're going to settings now oh wait

01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:04,740
I'm going to come back to the plugins

01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,180
those are my main ones my main like site

01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,410
set up ones I have some other ones for

01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,420
e-commerce and stuff like that we're

01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:12,780
gonna get to that a few minutes all

01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:14,010
right Settings General we have general

01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,710
writing/reading

01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:21,659
discussion media permalinks and privacy

01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:24,750
all under settings we're gonna talk

01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:27,539
about general first this is kind of

01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,460
where some SEO stuff happens so the site

01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:31,980
title and the tagline can really give

01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:34,440
you some SEO bump not like a huge bump

01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:36,510
but a little bit and this is also where

01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,500
your domain will live so if you change

01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:39,630
your domain you'll want to make sure

01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,980
this part is changed as well there's a

01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:43,710
whole process on how to change your

01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:45,989
domain your main domain and it does have

01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:48,119
to do with your hosting company so

01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:50,849
you'll need to look up how to change

01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:53,159
your domain via their knowledge base or

01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:55,110
their documentation because it can be a

01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:56,489
little tricky on certain different types

01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:59,369
of hosting so you want to make sure you

01:14:56,489 --> 01:15:00,989
have a like a one two three step guide

01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:03,599
for that before you just start changing

01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:05,269
stuff because it can break your site and

01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:08,579
then this is another important piece

01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:10,710
time zone I had a client who was telling

01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:11,820
us the other day she's like my posts are

01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,960
supposed to go out on Tuesday and I was

01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,730
like well they are going on on Tuesday

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,679
aren't things she said no they're going

01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:18,539
on a Wednesday at like 3:00 in the

01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,340
morning and I was like what that's not

01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:24,150
right so we looked at it and the time

01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:27,210
zone was off time zone was way off so

01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:28,289
fix your time zone and if you scroll up

01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:30,809
you'll get all the different countries

01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:32,880
and there's like New York I think or

01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:34,409
somewhere in here that's like you know

01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,719
what would be equivalent to Eastern time

01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:38,099
zone doesn't say Eastern but you can

01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,489
also use the offsets if you want if you

01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:42,659
know the offset I think ours is minus 5

01:15:40,489 --> 01:15:44,519
all right

01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:46,110
date formats if you like a certain kind

01:15:44,519 --> 01:15:47,969
of date format I just usually leave mine

01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,650
the same with the you know the word the

01:15:47,969 --> 01:15:52,019
number and then that's for letter or the

01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:54,329
for number year and then the time you

01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:55,860
have you know this type of time frame

01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:58,079
rather than 24 hour but it's up to you

01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:59,340
how you want to do that week starts on I

01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,199
like to change it to Sunday because

01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,679
calendar days I like the week to start

01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,440
on Sunday

01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:07,079
so that's just what I'm used to so I use

01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,219
that I just switched that over to then

01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:10,170
you hit the Save Changes and you're good

01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:12,389
but this is where you get some SEO stuff

01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:13,860
with the title and tagline your domain

01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:17,550
and then again like said that time zone

01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:20,659
thing is important okay let's talk about

01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:22,800
writing any questions about general

01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:26,699
titles let's just go over that real

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,930
quick how many of you think the title of

01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:31,860
your site should be

01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:34,020
the title of your site no now if you're

01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:36,540
doing SEO if you want to do some SEO

01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,040
fancy stuff and like I said I do some of

01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,210
this stuff as I build just because it's

01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,330
easier because you're already in there

01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:44,600
you would want to do something like let

01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:51,380
me give you an example

01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:54,330
Thomas McDonald's law her title cover

01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:57,480
family lawyer and probate attorney Miami

01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:58,430
Florida pipe the long stick thing on

01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,490
your keyboard

01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:04,700
Thomas McDonald law that's her whole

01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:08,610
title family lawyer and probate attorney

01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:10,740
the city Miami Florida and then the pipe

01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:12,540
and then Thomas McDonald law which is

01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:15,000
her actual name for company if she just

01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:17,280
put Thomas McDonald law how many people

01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,830
do you think are searching for Thomas

01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,760
McDonald law they're not searching for

01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:24,360
that they're searching for family

01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,040
attorney family lawyer probate right

01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,530
that's the stuff that's gonna come up

01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,540
she's gonna come up now in searches more

01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:33,780
likely I'll say more likely to come up

01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:36,570
in searches now because of that so

01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:40,560
that's an SEO thing not all my clients

01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:41,610
will let me do that it's okay but it's a

01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,810
thing that if you're going through and

01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:43,500
you're making a site it's just easy cuz

01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:47,040
you're in there already

01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,360
say what you do not what it is right so

01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:52,050
like put in there what you do not just

01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,790
what the name of the company is this is

01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,530
site title mm-hmm you can also put the

01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,960
tagline like I'm she has offices in

01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,540
Jacksonville Florida and Miami Florida I

01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,730
could put locations Miami Jacksonville

01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:04,650
you know Florida South East you know

01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,970
those kind of things kind of not you

01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,650
don't a keyword stuff but we were just

01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,620
like family comma lawyer

01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:13,080
comma attorney , you know probate comma

01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,700
you know adoptions comment you don't do

01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,320
that but you want to be it like a

01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,650
sentence so people can read it and it's

01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,650
appropriate

01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:25,770
okay writing some of these you might not

01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,150
think there's there's stuff in here but

01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:29,190
there's actually stuff everywhere and

01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:30,450
all these little settings things so

01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,150
here's where you do those category

01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:34,890
defaults remember we talked about that

01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:36,180
this is I only have on categorized so I

01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,740
don't have another one but it would show

01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,870
me all my categories here and I could

01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:41,640
set my default category most of my

01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:43,800
clients I do like a general category

01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,450
just called general that way if they

01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,100
don't have something specific they

01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:49,680
wanted to put it in we just put it in

01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:51,750
general somebody I have a news category

01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,520
and announcement category of video

01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:57,500
category excuse me

01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,730
I'll do see what else have I done

01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,710
like I said tech I can do like things

01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:05,340
like you know topic categories tech

01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:07,530
inspiration family stuff like that and

01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,690
you can set the default one here you can

01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,880
also set the post format default which

01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:13,260
is typically standard you can explore

01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:16,140
some of these you could actually Google

01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:17,730
you know writing settings and then

01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,200
WordPress and then type in one of these

01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,810
and it will tell you like what a quotes

01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,040
what a quote default looks like what an

01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:25,080
image default looks like things like

01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,050
that but standard gives you kind of all

01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:30,360
of those pieces together and then your

01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:31,560
mail server is here I typically don't

01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,140
mess with this because I don't send

01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:37,860
emails through I don't do post that's

01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:39,930
what's called email post uploads so that

01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,870
means you can email your own website and

01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:45,480
it will post for you kind of weird I

01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:48,720
think I don't know they may use that has

01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,770
anybody ever used it I never used it so

01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:53,100
you can set that up here if you really

01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:57,660
want to but too complicated I like

01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:59,970
simple right all right reading we have

01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:02,400
the open so I can't see it okay we have

01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:04,140
the home page settings we have some blog

01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,050
settings and some SEO visibility

01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:08,700
settings so the home page settings means

01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:11,190
with WordPress you get a couple of

01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,500
options you can have your latest posts

01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:15,450
as your home page a lot of people will

01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,370
do that if they're blogging it basically

01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,380
just says you don't have a home page but

01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:21,960
your post page is your home page so it's

01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:24,000
like a essentially a blog you see the

01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,920
latest post at the top you have some

01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,980
links you can link to a page if you want

01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,930
but you don't have a home page if you

01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,790
want to create a home page it says you

01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:36,000
can have your home page display a static

01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:37,830
page then you can say here's my home

01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,720
page and you link to it you drop down a

01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:42,270
link to it and here's a page where you

01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,400
can put my posts so you want a blank

01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:48,120
page where you can actually drop those

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,650
posts so I'll show you for example since

01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,980
we have a little bit of time I'll do it

01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,980
for you guys

01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:59,020
so I'm gonna do a new page nope not post

01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:00,630
I'm gonna do a new page I'm gonna call

01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:04,960
it home

01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:07,510
and I'm gonna do a new page and I'm

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,740
gonna call it posts this is kind of one

01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:11,590
of the first things I do when I go into

01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:15,160
a WordPress site then I go into the

01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:19,780
settings under it reading I'm gonna

01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:21,610
reading and I switch this to static I go

01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,380
to my home page and say home I go to my

01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,480
post page and say posts now those were

01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:28,060
just blank pages I made right I didn't

01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:32,590
do anything to those just blank and then

01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:36,610
I save it and now my website does not

01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:38,080
have my posts on it it just has a blank

01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:41,380
home page on it so I can make it

01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:43,810
whatever I want I can put my bio here I

01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:46,990
can put some pictures I can put my tag

01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:48,250
my tagline my mission statement all the

01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:52,630
fancy stuff you want to do on a home

01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:55,390
page and my menu does not have my post

01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:59,200
page cuz it's new so let me go up here

01:21:55,390 --> 01:22:01,930
to my menu here's my post page I just

01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:03,250
made and my home page this was an old

01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:08,050
home page so I don't need it I'm gonna

01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:09,490
remove it move home up move posts in now

01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:11,380
I'm gonna show you a little thing with

01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:13,120
menus while we're in here you know the

01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:14,920
category we made we had in there that's

01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,260
a post category right on categorized

01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:21,010
it's a post category I'm gonna make it a

01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:22,390
sub see how I moved it in a sub of my

01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:25,390
menu so now I have a drop-down

01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:29,170
essentially so let me save this and I'll

01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:32,410
show you what it looks like so now I

01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:34,510
have my home post sample let's chat

01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:37,360
right so if I go to post and I just

01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:40,390
click it I get my post page here's all

01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,190
my posts if I go to my Uncategorized I

01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:45,070
only see the posts that are in the

01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:47,200
uncatted rised category so you can use

01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:49,120
those categories as subs of your post

01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,070
section if you wanted in your menu so

01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,570
you could have like your tech posts and

01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:54,490
your inspiration post and all that could

01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:56,050
be under subs under your posts or you

01:22:54,490 --> 01:23:01,810
could call it blog or whatever so make

01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:03,460
sense yep I just moved it in just

01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,380
dragged it a little bit you can also

01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,860
have up to three tiers I think it's 3 or

01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,720
4 to

01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:15,910
inside like going down yeah questions

01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:17,560
good okay now remember do we design for

01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:24,220
mobile in this room or do we design for

01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:28,060
mobile we design for mobile always 70ish

01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:31,720
I'll just say ich percent of traffic is

01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:34,330
on a phone if you don't believe me think

01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,620
about yourself as a consumer I always

01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,700
tell people that people don't believe

01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,230
some of the statistics that are out

01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,610
there I think think about what you do

01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:43,030
are you on your phone most of the time

01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:45,280
probably right so if somebody's gonna

01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:46,390
look up this company or this website or

01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,530
this blog they're gonna be on their

01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:48,370
phone they might be on Pinterest and

01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:54,160
they find it through their whatever

01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:58,360
right and dropdowns and menus on you

01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:01,210
know this can be great on computer but

01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:04,780
when you get to mobile you have a little

01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:08,200
bit different issue see how it looks

01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:09,490
here if you had 50 dropdowns 50

01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,530
different categories under that

01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:14,230
drop-down that would take up the whole

01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:15,700
page you'd be scrolling and scrolling

01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:19,960
and scrolling just to get out of the

01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:23,080
menu so be careful with those dropdowns

01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:25,780
don't go crazy I actually try to not do

01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:28,000
dropdowns ever it's very rare that I'll

01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:30,850
do a drop-down and it's because you want

01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,710
people to have single click you know

01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:35,290
one-track mind almost do you want them

01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:36,910
to go I'm gonna go to blog and when I

01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:39,640
get to the blog if I see a list of

01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:41,350
categories at the top of the page great

01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,110
but I don't need them in drop-down

01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:46,660
necessarily right so keep that in mind

01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:48,880
don't don't go drop-down crazy cuz

01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:51,700
you're designing for mobile great way to

01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:54,520
check your mobile view make your browser

01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:56,550
really tiny and now you have mobile view

01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,510
and then I can see what it looks like

01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:00,040
look at all that stuff in the footer

01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,170
actually this is the sidebar you see

01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:04,780
that sidebar look how much sidebar stuff

01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:07,720
is there it's a ton again something

01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,920
that's not really needed on mobile but

01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,600
on the website it doesn't look so bad

01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,430
right so I cants on the side whatever

01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,410
when you go to mobile it's all at the

01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:16,450
bottom so you may not need all that junk

01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:17,980
there so keep that in mind to when

01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:20,250
you're looking at it check your mobile

01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:24,340
as you go

01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:27,700
okay let me get this back to where we

01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:32,380
can see everything all right let's go to

01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:34,950
discussion under settings any questions

01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:40,930
by the way yet miss any all right

01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:42,820
yes question no it's not the only way

01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:45,400
different brows I mean different

01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,050
browsers have different options also you

01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,370
can get like chrome plugins that help

01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,590
you do that there's a thing called

01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:53,080
screen fly comm you can check it there

01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:57,489
on like an iPhone 6 like something

01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:59,200
really small you can also do like some

01:25:57,489 --> 01:26:01,060
of the themes actually have a button

01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,250
that says look at it on tablet look at

01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:06,070
it on mobile it'll show you that like

01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:07,150
Divi does that really well but to kind

01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:09,219
of do it like the quick and dirty way

01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:11,320
like just real quick that's what I do

01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:14,770
just to see sometimes it'll resize

01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:16,210
sometimes it won't so it really depends

01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:18,730
but there's the things like screen fly

01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:20,410
chrome browser plugins and then of

01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:24,520
course like the theme often we'll have

01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:27,250
that as well okay hey discussion

01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:29,170
settings this is where all your comment

01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,850
information is also if you want to get

01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:32,380
email notifications every time someone

01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:34,570
comments or every time someone replies

01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:36,070
to a comment or all that kind of stuff

01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:37,540
and as the administrator if you have

01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:38,860
multiple people helping you and they're

01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,989
working on the site with you and their

01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,310
other users you want to make sure you've

01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:43,570
got all those notifications coming in

01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,860
because if they do something and you

01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,320
didn't know they were doing something

01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:49,030
you want to be notified if it's just you

01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,620
but you want to know every time some of

01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:53,160
the comments you can just check these

01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:54,850
boxes and kind of give yourself whatever

01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:58,480
options you want these are pretty

01:26:54,850 --> 01:27:01,090
self-explanatory see it says here you

01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:05,650
know like a attempt to notify any blogs

01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:07,390
linked to or from the article allow link

01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:09,190
notifications from other blogs like if

01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:12,780
someone links to you then it'll notify

01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:15,300
you allow anyone to comment on a post

01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:17,560
the comment can be held for moderation

01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,210
that's in here as well which is what I

01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,160
always like I don't like my comments

01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:23,650
just going out there willy-nilly I need

01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,940
to see him before they go out comment

01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:26,860
author must have been previously

01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,750
approved in a comment before their

01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:30,250
comment can appear so you have to

01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,990
approve it before it can go out that

01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,390
kind of stuff and then

01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:35,860
comment moderation' you can give like a

01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:37,360
little description of hey we're gonna

01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:39,940
hold your comment for two days before

01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,680
it's approved all that kind of stuff and

01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:44,650
then there's a blacklist section and

01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,910
then the avatars you can choose what

01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,080
kind of avatar you want for people who

01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:50,350
just kind of comment they don't have

01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:56,740
accounts with WordPress so just some fun

01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:58,690
things there okay let's go to media this

01:27:56,740 --> 01:28:00,790
is a very short section now some of you

01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:02,530
may see a section that says location

01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:05,320
media file location

01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:08,200
does anybody have that by chance under

01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:10,870
media say media file location or

01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,460
something like that if you ever find

01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:14,380
that your images are broken or you're

01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:16,090
not allowed to upload from them to the

01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:18,640
media folder if you've ever had that

01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:21,010
happen to you the simple fix is to go to

01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:24,790
settings go to media and in here you'll

01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:27,700
see an additional field that has a like

01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:29,740
a path in it like a website domain path

01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,330
in it and what that's telling you is

01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:34,630
this is where we're saving all these

01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:36,220
media files and you can't upload it's

01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:38,950
telling you Error error you cannot

01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:40,780
upload HTTP error so what happens is

01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:42,010
this little line it's not in here but

01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,870
like I said that additional field that

01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:46,390
gets corrupted it's the wrong file name

01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:47,890
the wrong file path and so what you can

01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:50,410
do is that there's a online articles

01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:52,540
that tell you how to fix it what to put

01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:55,180
in the file path and as soon as you do

01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:57,190
that it's like magic it just works and

01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:58,300
you can upload all you want so if you

01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:59,890
ever run into that where you can't

01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,790
upload images and it gives you error

01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:03,130
after error after

01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:04,540
error I do all the things first right

01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:04,810
research your computer research your

01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,250
router

01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:08,170
if it's still giving you the errors it's

01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:09,790
probably this go in here and find an

01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:12,160
article that talks about unable to

01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:13,660
upload media to WordPress and it will

01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,320
tell you exactly how to fix it but that

01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:19,840
would be listed in here and then you

01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:21,910
have the thumbnail sizes there default

01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,860
medium size is default and large size is

01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:26,230
default these are pretty much optimized

01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,850
for you know WordPress you don't really

01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:30,010
want anything else when you upload a

01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:32,560
file an image it creates one of each of

01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:34,120
these for you and then you can just say

01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,110
I want to use the medium size and then

01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,680
it will just give you that size

01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:37,680
automatically

01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:45,650
depends on what you upload who said that

01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:51,190
oh sorry I couldn't see I was like ready

01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:56,180
to come yes yep

01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:58,030
all right permalinks permalinks so

01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:00,620
remember I mentioned about those slugs

01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:01,880
right slugs making it easy for you to

01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,200
remember easy something you could

01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,150
actually type in if you're just doing

01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:09,500
off the top of your head this is kind of

01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:11,090
the same thing I like to use the post to

01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:14,000
name that's the one I like to use just

01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:16,250
because it's simple it doesn't have all

01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,880
those numbers and you know dates and

01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,740
stuff in it

01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,840
a lot of times when we blog how many

01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:23,150
people in here are like true bloggers

01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,840
like that's what you do okay

01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:30,200
that one hand just okay she's gonna

01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:36,380
start how many of you are like I started

01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:37,700
a blog once right once and how many of

01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:40,850
you are like I've been meaning to do

01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:44,390
that okay that's the rest of us right

01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:46,040
except for this guy he's awesome so the

01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:48,200
thing about that is it's gonna put dates

01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:51,260
on all your stuff do you want someone to

01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,180
know that you wrote that post in 2013 no

01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:55,370
you want to be able to reuse that sucker

01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:56,570
today and have nobody know the

01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:59,000
difference because the contents still

01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:59,540
great so I don't like putting dates on

01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,970
my stuff

01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:03,950
I like having no dates whatsoever

01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:07,070
because I reuse that stuff all the time

01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:09,380
I'll pull posts from 2015 that I wrote

01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:11,110
that it probably used from 2012 go in

01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:18,400
there tweak a few words and repost it

01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:18,400
new fresh content and nobody knows huh

01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:22,010
huh

01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,650
I know that's the same thing so if

01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,630
you're using these permalinks that have

01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:33,930
the date in them it's gonna be the same

01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:36,180
thing when it was posted typically it's

01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:37,920
gonna those gonna match I don't like

01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:40,200
that to show because like I like to

01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,090
reuse my stuff over and over so every

01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,290
year I go through my last three years I

01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,100
delete the ones that aren't relevant

01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:46,200
anymore

01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:48,210
and then I read I kind of refresh the

01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,010
ones that are relevant and then I start

01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:56,850
scheduling them back out so am i never

01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:58,620
have dates on them it does yeah right

01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:00,210
because you have specific things now and

01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,800
some of that though you're gonna have

01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:04,170
evergreen content that doesn't have

01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,100
dates but using dates is gonna be better

01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:09,110
because then you're gonna say okay this

01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:12,900
was a 2018 Post versus a 2019 post yeah

01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:15,330
all right so but I like to use the post

01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,940
name one and whether you use the post

01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:19,110
name one or the one with the date in it

01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,580
that doesn't matter even if you're using

01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:23,400
dates because the dates will always show

01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:25,080
on the actual page itself you can turn

01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,820
it on or off there's an option to turn

01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,910
on or off but you can you can show the

01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:32,730
date on the post so it's up to you

01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:36,870
but I like to use a simple one all right

01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:38,670
and then privacy this is where your

01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:43,350
privacy policy should be how many people

01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:44,370
have a privacy policy yeah okay so this

01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,870
is important

01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:47,550
usually it's something a lawyer will

01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:50,400
drop for you you can also purchase them

01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:53,220
online for different industries and

01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,780
they're usually pretty standard you want

01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:56,490
to create a new page for it it needs to

01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:58,350
have its own page also terms and

01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:59,790
conditions things like that but this is

01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:02,660
specifically the privacy policy and

01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:02,660
where that would be located

01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,159
okay now we're to the maintenance part

01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,010
so you guys had your list right that I

01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:15,280
was been adding to this whole time you

01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:19,340
need to be updating your site every

01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,829
single month if not more if you can do

01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:23,179
more that'd be great

01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:25,040
once a month is like my minimum

01:33:23,179 --> 01:33:27,760
requirement for my when I talk to people

01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,619
and I try to educate them on this stuff

01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,810
if you update your site cuz anybody's

01:33:30,619 --> 01:33:36,849
site ever gone white when they've

01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:39,380
updated it how fun was that it's so fun

01:33:36,849 --> 01:33:41,510
that means that a plug-in broke your

01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,099
site or a theme broke your site or a

01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:46,480
plug-in the theme or like I'm not doing

01:33:43,099 --> 01:33:50,110
this today and they both broke your site

01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:52,520
so this can happen anytime you update

01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:53,960
and it could be a wordpress update it

01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:55,340
could be a theme update or a plug-in

01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,790
update those are the three main pieces

01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:01,520
you update custom work does anybody have

01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:04,790
a custom site it was done by someone

01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:08,360
else that's super custom and you cannot

01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:10,460
update it those are a problem if you've

01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:14,570
got one of those you can have some work

01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:16,070
to do but do not update yet you want to

01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:17,239
make sure it's stable before you start

01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:19,369
updating stuff because you may actually

01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:21,849
lose a lot of that customization that

01:34:19,369 --> 01:34:25,610
was done if they didn't do it correctly

01:34:21,849 --> 01:34:27,619
being cautious of bad updates how many

01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:32,570
of you are in a Facebook group about

01:34:27,619 --> 01:34:35,719
WordPress okay go on Facebook type in

01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:37,579
WordPress and look for a group if you

01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:39,770
have theme did you know your theme has

01:34:37,579 --> 01:34:41,750
if it's a good theme this is a way to

01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:44,500
check it's a good theme it's gonna have

01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:47,449
groups on Facebook as you can join and

01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:49,460
you should join those two three or four

01:34:47,449 --> 01:34:51,920
of those the reason I say this is

01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:53,150
because when you update your theme so

01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,130
let's say Divi for example when

01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:56,900
Gutenberg came out everybody was like oh

01:34:55,130 --> 01:35:00,349
no Gutenberg's gonna break my site

01:34:56,900 --> 01:35:03,110
Davy's gonna be a useless and there was

01:35:00,349 --> 01:35:04,760
a wordpress update that I had had

01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:07,880
Guttenberg in it and then there was a

01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,409
Divi update that said disable Guttenberg

01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,790
and everything will be fine like it was

01:35:09,409 --> 01:35:12,260
in the Divi Update it wasn't in a

01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:14,210
separate plug-in even it wasn't in the

01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:17,090
Divi Update because the way that it runs

01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:18,980
right now it doesn't use that piece so

01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,179
it turns it off so you're not running

01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,290
your site down you're not doing

01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:23,690
there's no extra code that's like

01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:26,090
interfering it just says you be dormant

01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:28,909
over here and I will do my thing over

01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:31,699
here so the the first one I did was as

01:35:28,909 --> 01:35:32,920
was it done the first Divi Update it

01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:35,300
actually broke a bunch of people's sites

01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,800
and those people are mostly developers

01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:38,780
so they went in and did their backups

01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,790
and they were cool but if you're not a

01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:43,699
developer one you should be back in your

01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:45,080
site up every month also but you can

01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:48,710
actually look on those forums and

01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:51,140
they'll say five point one point two is

01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:55,150
not good it's been breaking a lot of

01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:57,620
sites five point one point three is

01:35:55,150 --> 01:36:00,230
great everybody's been updating to it no

01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:02,360
problems no issues we're good

01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,380
so it makes sense so you can like get

01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,429
into one of these communities where

01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,770
people are gonna just tell you all that

01:36:04,429 --> 01:36:07,820
stuff they're gonna tell you all that

01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:11,300
and you don't have to worry about it

01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:12,650
okay and then be on top of the security

01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,210
updates you when you're in these forums

01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:16,460
as well you're gonna see somebody say

01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:17,870
there was a big security break there was

01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,280
a big I mean big security hole we're

01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:21,170
gonna get a new patch coming out it's

01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,840
coming out today if you're using X

01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:26,300
plug-in please delete it now you can go

01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,250
in fix your site and you're covered or

01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:29,989
you can go in update the patch you're

01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:32,300
covered but you'll need to know about

01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:33,590
those things like right away and that's

01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,810
why I like Facebook because you see it

01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:38,719
on your feed you get notifications about

01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:42,500
it things like that all right

01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:45,140
um we're gonna take a like five or so

01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,429
minutes break and then I'm gonna come

01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:49,540
back and tell you all the plug-in more

01:36:46,429 --> 01:36:49,540
