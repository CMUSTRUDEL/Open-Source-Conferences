	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,620
the spring of 2013 that I took my first

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,870
trip to Austin Texas for South by

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,390
Southwest Interactive if you've never

00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,960
been it's this giant tech conference in

00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,430
a really cool city where all of the big

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,810
names in tech are coming together to

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,240
show off what they've been working on

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,000
and there's also this huge convention

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,759
floor where you have hundreds of vendors

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,130
just hanging out swag and trying to

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:32,870
generally make a sale though let's be

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,660
honest for me it was mostly about the

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,629
swag it was on this convention floor

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,340
that I met a woman named Anna Anna with

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,149
a project manager at a small Ashington

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,960
dc-based

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,809
agency called three-spot her both

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,269
immediately caught my eye because it had

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:53,120
the words fudging care or don't fudging

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:56,780
do it and blazoned on a screen they

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,519
didn't say fudge something about this

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,829
resonated with me perhaps it was the

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,510
liberal use of profanity but I stopped

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,309
to compliment their marketing and I got

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,040
to talking about Anna about three-spot

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,260
and their mission and they're all about

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,760
building software with a purpose if

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,830
you're building something that you don't

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,660
really care about what's the point in

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,950
doing it

00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,200
pre-spawn intentionally filters some of

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,130
their client prospects to organizations

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,170
that are trying to make a positive

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,910
change in the world their client roster

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,280
includes groups like the National Parks

00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,660
Conservation Association National Park

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Service the Bill and Melinda Gates

00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,670
Foundation the ACLU and the Smithsonian

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,700
Institution I'm guessing you've probably

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,530
heard of at least one of those had I not

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,990
been at South by Southwest on the

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,990
company's dime and I suppose recently

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,820
bought a house in Columbus I probably

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,600
would have quit my job right then to

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,610
move to DC and work for three spot a

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,980
large part of my career has been spent

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,530
on the services side of things you know

00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,390
agencies I worked for several agencies

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,720
and dozens of clients many of whom

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:05,540
needed modern websites to attract more

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:08,019
customers to sell more stuff one agency

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,220
I did work for is a fast food company

00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:13,250
nationally internationally known for

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,020
their golden arches I'm not going to

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,760
name names here but I'm pretty sure you

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,930
know who I'm

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:25,030
about advance slide come on

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:27,090
ruin the joke timing specifically it was

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,540
a bunch of regional franchisees that

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,840
bond or that banded their marketing

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,670
budgets together so rather than like one

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,940
or two restaurants going hey we're over

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,430
here we were doing work for like 40% of

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,739
these restaurants in Ohio there were

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,840
literally nights when I was home late in

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,599
order to build websites to sell more

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,730
cheeseburgers I wasn't pushing social

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,599
causes or were life-saving medical

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,510
products or anything

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,180
I was literally selling cheeseburgers

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,389
show of hands how many people here have

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,209
heard of cheeseburgers before oh you've

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,739
heard of them wonderful please go buy

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,440
cheeseburgers and biking from this

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,540
particular big multinational corporation

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,690
that was the message I was spending my

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,909
nights trying to push it brought me to

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,680
the somewhat nihilistic realization that

00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:21,370
a good portion of the software that we

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,739
write is I hate to say it kind of

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,540
meaningless like super dumb untold hours

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,959
pour it into selling a few more

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,430
cheeseburgers or widgets or whatever or

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,829
building an app that does something that

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,739
nobody in the history of the human race

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,750
has needed but somebody has money and

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,760
they think it can make them money so

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,699
they're willing to pay you to build it

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,599
for them take a moment to let that sink

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:51,069
in all of this work all of these hours

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,079
spent doing something as silly as

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:59,470
reminding people that cheeseburgers are

00:03:53,079 --> 00:04:01,959
a viable food option this is how we're

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,109
spending our time that's where I was a

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,669
few years ago too but then I learned how

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,290
to find the deeper meaning in the

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,750
software that I write and that's what I

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,579
want to talk to you about today if the

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,489
software is meaningless we need to

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:18,479
either find meaning in what we do or do

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,479
something that actually matters

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,479
let's try to look past the cheeseburger

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,940
for a moment and find meaning in what

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,039
we're doing today if it seems that the

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,310
software rebuilding is meaningless maybe

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,030
try reframing it spin around a few times

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,740
stand on your head

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,479
hop on one foot whatever you have to do

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,379
to see that it's not about the

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,970
cheeseburger

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,620
there is no cheeseburger ok there is a

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,430
cheeseburger and it's delicious but the

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,340
cheeseburger isn't the point here mmm

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,379
it's the small franchise owners that

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,180
we're building the software for the the

00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,099
people who are creating jobs they're

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,930
providing low-cost food opportunities in

00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,610
the community the work I was doing

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,340
wasn't for the giant multinational

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,960
company I was working for with the

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,270
franchise owners the franchise owners

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,860
who might own one or two restaurants a

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,159
piece and they've pulled their money

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,969
together to try to remind their

00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:19,740
neighbors that yes we're still here sure

00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,479
our food is exactly the same as

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,520
thousands of other restaurants across

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,770
the world and it's spicy and it's

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,120
over-salted and really it's kind of not

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:33,599
very good but we the franchise owners we

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,699
are still here nutritional deficiencies

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,500
aside do you know what kinds of people

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,610
benefit from fast-food being in their

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:44,460
communities to be honest it's not really

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:48,120
me my wife is very big on on cooking

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,150
healthy and we have a little kid that

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:56,849
she does not want to be a bigger kid

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,830
that way so I'm not the one pitting from

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,349
fast-food restaurants but you have

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,090
lower-income families you have single

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:08,069
parents struggling to put a hot meal on

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:10,979
the table for their kids you have people

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,840
who work second or third shifts and they

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,909
miss out on the traditional restaurants

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,710
have you ever tried going out and

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,219
getting like a nice dinner at 2:00 in

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,710
the morning

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,710
your options are Taco Bell in the Waffle

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,419
House we have the road warriors we have

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,580
workers who don't have the privilege of

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:30,719
a full hour for lunch and they literally

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,149
just have time they had a drive-thru we

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,540
have small town folks my wife is from a

00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,720
small

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,730
near Mansfield the nicest restaurants in

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,890
her town are the fast food places by the

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,390
highway it's really kind of depressing

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,000
we also have the disabled or retired

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,380
workers that need these jobs maybe to

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,510
keep a roof over their heads or maybe

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,110
just to stop from slowly drifting off

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,510
into senility it's really easy to frame

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,130
fast food it's just cheap greasy food

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,020
served up by a multi-billion dollar

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,500
corporation headed by a literal clown

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,880
and that's true too don't get me wrong

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,630
but it also represents a source of food

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,880
a sense of safety a sense of community

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,230
for these people that I've named and so

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,840
when I was selling cheeseburgers I

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,400
wasn't doing it for the clown I was

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,740
supporting these small business owners

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,630
the people they employ and the people

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,880
who eat there it's not what I personally

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,820
choose to eat but I realized that I'm

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,900
fortunate enough to have that choice

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,700
let's get away from cheeseburgers for a

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,080
second because frankly I'm getting

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,940
hungry and I just had one of the

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,390
delicious doughnuts Bill's donuts by the

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,170
way Dayton local yes awesome good

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:42,240
doughnuts maybe you're not building

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,560
marketing websites but instead you're

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,200
building applications for companies

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,230
you're doing another CRM integration or

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:54,180
another crud app because bill and Brenda

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:57,390
in accounting can't agree on how the

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,220
inventory spreadsheet should work you

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,080
may have recently spent six solid months

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,690
of your life building an application

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:10,650
that only a handful of people will ever

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:14,070
see use or even know exists this is my

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,900
boss guy named Chris lemon and I'm not

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,940
just name dropping because like star

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:23,100
power in first keynote but you might

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,360
know him he's generally considered a

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,180
pretty big deal in the WordPress space

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,460
but besides that he's also a really

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,620
solid product person and I'm learning a

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,770
lot working under him a few months ago

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,229
Chris tweeted this never forget why

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,290
people pay for things people pay to

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:43,830
solve pain people pay to accelerate a

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,680
result people pay to skip failure people

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,970
pay to reach a destination

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,470
let's say in the scenario you've spent

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,720
the last six months of your life

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,490
building some internal application

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,440
you've been paid for your time I mean I

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,050
certainly hope you've been paid for the

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,779
last six months of your life and sure

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,980
only a few people will ever you see or

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,410
even know about the app that you've

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,350
built but which of these reasons is the

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,579
reason that they hired you to do it do

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,529
they have a pain point that you helped

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,510
them solve with something really

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,740
error-prone before and now you've put

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,220
the guardrails in place to make sure

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,750
that it just works maybe there was a

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,670
process that was really slow and it

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,040
caused them a lot of painting at the end

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,320
of each month was someone spending days

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,449
or weeks compiling numbers for some

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,240
leadership report and now that process

00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:33,250
takes seconds rather than days how much

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,820
time did you just save that person

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,959
through your work

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,120
did someone invest in you for your

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,519
knowledge knowing that yeah I probably

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,769
could figure this out and then 18 months

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,209
later they'd be like oh no I I've

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,740
stressed myself out I don't know

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,660
anything this is terrible

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,250
and they went no I'm going to hire the

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,899
person who knows what they're doing I'm

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,149
going to trust them to build it I'm

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,529
going to pay them to build it and I'm

00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,170
going to have something that I can rely

00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:02,110
on or maybe their company needed to get

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,850
somewhere did you just replace an old

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,350
billing system that was storing payment

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,079
information and securely for instance

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,480
because I mean I know that's that's a

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,430
shocker that there's their payment

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,920
systems that store but can that company

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,660
now claim PCI compliance does that open

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,000
up new markets to them new business

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,709
opportunities did your efforts enable

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,720
those handful of users to do their jobs

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:28,600
better therefore moving that whole

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,360
company forward or freeing them up to do

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,339
what they do best

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,420
my brother is a Navy technician at a

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,540
hospital back home he and his team are

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,220
responsible for all of the

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,560
teleconferencing equipment all of the

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,829
projectors and things in this this giant

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,310
medical campus the number of times he's

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:53,670
had to hike like a mile across campus to

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,959
go help some doctor turn on a projector

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,610
it's more times than he cares to count

00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,810
but I want you to remember that the

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,910
people giving

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,040
presentations and hospitals these aren't

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,410
usually dumb people these are often

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,040
renowned surgeons or doctors or

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,100
researchers yeah they might struggle

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,630
getting Skype working properly but as

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,370
much as I love my brother I can

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,500
guarantee you I'd rather have them work

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,000
on me if my appendix were to burst then

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,650
have my brother who has no medical

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,650
training but is really good at computers

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,210
operating on me if your job enables

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,210
other people to do their jobs well

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,400
you're contributing sure he's turning on

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,380
a projector and to be fair a trained

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,210
surgeon probably shouldn't have any

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:43,089
issues turning on a projector I mean

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:45,070
it's not like it's well surgery but if

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,750
the act of turning on that projector

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,120
means that this surgeon can present

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,480
findings that for instance can help end

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,270
childhood leukemia the dude you turn on

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,339
the projector this goes double if you're

00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,980
a manager if you have people working

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,110
under you making sure that they see the

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,330
positive impact of their work how

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,130
they're contributing to the the larger

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,440
and greater good that should be one of

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,500
your top priorities make it easy for

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,120
them to see how they're helping other

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,120
people and reinforce that they're not

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,370
just toiling away at some meaningless

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,660
task you know working toward some unseen

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,150
goal people pay to solve pain people pay

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,910
to accelerate a results people pay to

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,370
skip failure people pay to reach a

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,400
destination which of these are you doing

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,320
for your clients once you're able to

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,410
reframe what you're working on as

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,640
trivial as the work may seem it's

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,740
possible to find meaning in the

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,190
otherwise meaningless you're not just

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,990
writing it to sell more suburb to some

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:51,940
more cheeseburgers you're writing

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,400
software for the people let's look at

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,040
the other side what if it is as shallow

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,170
as it seems after all sometimes the

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,720
cheeseburger is it's really just a

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,270
cheeseburger you can twist it a hundred

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,650
different ways but not absolutely

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,370
everything is going to have some deeper

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,500
meaning behind it maybe you're working

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,660
for a start-up whose stated mission it's

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,269
to quote get

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:20,519
paid and get laid man nice worse maybe

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:22,740
you're working for the bad guys if your

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,139
employer or your clients are trying to

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,149
sell cigarettes to kids or restrict

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,970
access to health care or locking babies

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,949
and cages well it's going to be a lot

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:37,050
harder to pinpoint those positive

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:40,199
attributes if the work you're doing

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,329
today isn't helping people or worse it's

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,449
actively hurting people and what do you

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:47,370
doing if you're not actively making the

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:49,740
world a better place with what you're

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,079
doing or empowering other people to make

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,410
progress then it's time to make a change

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,730
or get out of the game like you to

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,360
introduce you to a friend and colleague

00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,970
of mine

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,930
this is Andrew Norcross most people just

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,819
call him Norcross and Norcross here he

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,819
has what I like to call a strong social

00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:10,709
conscience if you haven't met him he's

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,350
he's covered in tattoos you can see

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,079
Milhouse there on his forearm he's a

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:19,139
proud Floridian and he can talk your ear

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,449
off about genres of heavy music that I'm

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,980
not entirely sure actually exists but he

00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:24,870
seems really excited so I just sort of

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,470
nod my head and go oh yeah no they were

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,810
great all right so here come the

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,490
politics and I'm not looking to get into

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,880
a debate here it's far too early for

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,100
that

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,769
find me at the after party and I'm happy

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,170
to do this but for those who don't know

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,959
me let's just say that I'm not the

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,699
biggest fan of the current US president

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,180
or the people you surround himself with

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,889
yeah that's it's probably a nice way to

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,500
put it

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,209
anyway in the the summer of 2018 the

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,329
trunk administration came under fire for

00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:00,240
their zero tolerance family separation

00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,680
policy if families were caught illegally

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,500
crossing the border into the United

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,720
States the policy basically stated that

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,550
children should be separated from the

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,540
adults that they were traveling with the

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,120
reasoning from the Trump administration

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,680
being something along the lines of if

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,120
they're afraid to be separated from

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,220
their families they'll be less likely to

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,529
attempt to cross something of an

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,689
oversimplification sure but let's let's

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:24,809
roll with it for now so these children

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,970
around 3000 that we know of we're

00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,369
separated from their family

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,259
of course you can't just send them back

00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:33,349
home they literally just crossed the

00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,419
border with their families so what do

00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,519
you do with a bunch of kids I mean

00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,439
clearly you lock them in detention

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,819
centers right I mean not like some

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,629
daycare center like where we sound like

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:43,849
kid

00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,649
you know oh go play with the other kids

00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:47,269
while we process the family now it's

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,989
something more along the lines of

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,999
fun-sized internment camp

00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:56,479
anyway good people don't abide this kind

00:15:52,999 --> 00:16:00,259
of injustice nor cross nor crosses good

00:15:56,479 --> 00:16:02,059
people on a Friday evening a friend of

00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,959
Norcross has reached out and asked him

00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:09,499
for some help scoping out a an important

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,389
but time-sensitive project by the end of

00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:14,269
the call Norcross had cleared his entire

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,769
weekend and set to work in a

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,529
conversation I had with Norcross about

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,359
the project he said by late Sunday I

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,579
realized it was a larger project than

00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:27,199
any of us imagined but I don't think I

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,609
could have lived with myself but I don't

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,349
think I could have lived with myself if

00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:34,759
I just said sorry too busy the project

00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,079
has it turned out was a collaboration

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,059
between the Vera Institute of Justice

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,639
and New America called the immigrant

00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:42,289
connection project or icon they were

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,819
building a tool to help attorneys who

00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,709
are working around the clock to reunite

00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:48,349
these separated families and ensure a

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,569
due process for all involved from the

00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:52,339
icon web site icon as a resource for

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,449
parents who have been separated from

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,220
their children due to the

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:57,049
administration's zero-tolerance policy

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,269
as well as for the attorneys of these

00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,679
parents to locate and connect with the

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,339
legal service providers working with

00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:08,089
their children our boss Chris he was

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,409
completely supportive 100% developing

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,059
and iterating on our products is

00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,610
absolutely important I mean after all

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:15,589
that's how we get paid but losing one

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,110
developer for a week or two to help

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,970
reunite kids with their families that's

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,370
a bit more important than shipping

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,409
something off the road map so Norcross

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,750
spent the next week or two workdays

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,899
evenings weekend's just completely

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,429
focused on his work for icon ultimately

00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,610
children in around a hundred of these

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:36,049
centers were processed by icon aiding

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,680
attorneys and reuniting the families

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:42,850
it's far from everyone but it

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,790
absolutely a step in the right direction

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,080
another quote from my chat with Norcross

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,850
pushing back against the evil you see in

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,700
the world is more than just punching

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,290
Nazis I mean that's absolutely an

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,210
important part but the ultimate act of

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,400
rebellion is insisting on compassion

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,140
kindness and grace and what has become a

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,150
pretty dark world when you talk think

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,800
about the positive impact of norcross's

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,510
work how he was willing to put

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,640
everything he had in helping these kids

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,090
that he's never met before he'll likely

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,070
never meet again that's using software

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,500
for the greater good is it's using your

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,050
abilities your skills to make a positive

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,190
change in the world

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,020
maybe you're not dealing with external

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,230
forces though maybe your employer is

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,630
doing things they just don't feel right

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,420
whatever your beliefs however you feel

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,860
however you twist this you just feel

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,120
deep in your gut that what they're doing

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,890
is wrong we don't have to love our jobs

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,470
but it's really nice when we're not

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:48,470
embarrassed or have to whisper

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:50,420
who we work for we're not like is

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,630
sincerely hope that everyone in this

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,940
room has a job that they can be proud of

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,180
or if not proud of at least not wake up

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,590
feeling disgusted by companies don't

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,360
always make the best decisions I

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,100
honestly that's really putting it

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,170
lightly but it doesn't mean that we're

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,050
bad people for working for them or

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,560
having them as clients after all warm

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,120
fuzzies don't put food on the table that

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,100
doesn't absolve us from responsibility

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,140
though if you knew the work you were

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,870
doing was being used to hurt people

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,940
would you still do it let's say you

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,790
produce fencing for a living and someone

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,230
says hey we need you to build cages so

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,070
that we can lock up more kids in these

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,070
detention centers

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,639
a lot of lighter note last summer

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,309
Facebook released an app in the app

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:45,340
marketplace is called inaho protect it's

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:49,619
meant to be a free virtual VPN or the

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,539
free virtual private network or VPN

00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,919
after all being busy 21st century people

00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:57,309
we're all on the go right we don't want

00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,220
to be sitting in a coffee shop or an

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,809
airport or a conference and having

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,470
someone sitting over in the corner like

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:09,399
stealing our passwords so VPNs are

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:12,340
awesome don't get me wrong but a good

00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:14,799
VPN needs to keep your data private kind

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,409
of in the name Virtual Private Network

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,210
and I'm not just talking about being

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,309
private from people on your network but

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,100
private from the virtual private network

00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:26,379
service itself logs need to be purged or

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,820
not kept at all and you certainly

00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:30,509
shouldn't be paying someone to then just

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,590
turn around and sniff your traffic

00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:35,919
unfortunately a lot of the free or

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,519
low-cost VPNs they have to make their

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,289
money somehow

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,840
so sometimes they've used some less than

00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,629
awesome things with our data well now

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,919
who protect was being run by a little

00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:49,809
company you may have heard of called

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:51,549
Facebook yeah that Facebook let me

00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,350
remind you Facebook's this giant

00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:57,070
corporation that's made billions by

00:20:53,350 --> 00:21:01,960
collecting data through let's say less

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:05,950
than honest means I mean in order to

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,379
sell really targeted advertisement or ad

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,480
placements to advertisers if an

00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:13,659
advertiser wanted to target let's say

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,149
white guys named Steve within two miles

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:19,259
of this building you can bet that

00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:22,210
Facebook could accommodate that request

00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,249
Facebook is amazing at what they do but

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,769
they employ and they employ a lot of

00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,539
great well-meaning people but the core

00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:31,629
of what Facebook does is collect as much

00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:33,999
information about you as possible so

00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:35,980
they launch a novel protect a free VPN

00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,549
to low people into this false sense of

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,090
security

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:42,100
oh great I can go do my banking I can go

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,629
communicate with people whatever because

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,530
I'm on a VPN so it doesn't matter that

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:47,870
I'm on a public Wi-Fi network

00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,820
you're on a VPN and owned by one of the

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,300
biggest abusers of online privacy that

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,180
we've ever seen worst yet o novel

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,710
protect operates at a lower level than

00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,720
most applications on your phone this

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,520
isn't just Facebook saying AHA we're

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,560
gonna see everything you do in the

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,140
Facebook and Instagram apps and don't

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,820
worry they do that too but because it's

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,950
a VPN and it's working at a lower level

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,930
on your phone's operating system they

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,030
can see all of the traffic going through

00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,060
your phone are you sending an email

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,040
Facebook's aware of it are you playing

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,570
Words With Friends Facebook sees the

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,230
traffic every API endpoint every URL is

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,090
being hit Facebook knows about it

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,400
so Apple caught on and was like yeah

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,680
we're gonna need you to cut this out so

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,650
Facebook poll doe novel protect but then

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,810
this year 2019 news broke that they

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,830
released it as Facebook's research VPN

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:44,720
they even went around the the App

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,490
Store's rules by using their Enterprise

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,340
certificate that's the the thing that

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,870
allows companies at the size of like

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,670
Facebook to say hey we're going to have

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,340
an app that people put on their phones

00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,840
to say hey what's for lunch today in the

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,540
company cafeteria but not have to

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,460
destroy so something meant for private

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,160
internal use they start using this to

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,850
distribute this invasive VPN to the

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,100
general public

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,980
worse yet they start offering to pay

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,840
people to install this so they're

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,060
literally going sir may i bug you

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,490
literally may i

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:23,300
intercept all of your traffic here's $20

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:25,910
for your trouble I'm reminded of when I

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,920
was 18 it was before smartphones but

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,800
right is facebook was getting started so

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,330
I'll let you do the math some friends of

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,920
mine got involved with one of those

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,680
programs where they go around and they

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:43,100
say hey you can get a free t-shirt free

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:47,960
to anyone else to do that yeah we've

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:50,120
been there so a dumb free t-shirt in

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,950
exchange for a credit card that eighteen

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,679
year old Steve absolutely did not need

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,630
I'll be honest looking back I can't tell

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,759
you what the t-shirt said I wore it

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,579
maybe once or twice if

00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:03,739
if ever and it was probably just some

00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:06,499
bad pun because well that's who I am now

00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:08,599
and that's who I was then too so I get

00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:11,779
this t-shirt and I'm I'm home for

00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:15,379
cutting everything and my mom my mom is

00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:18,739
a CFO by the way so my mom my CFO mother

00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:22,940
is like so Steve this credit card showed

00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:27,289
up with your name on it like oh fudge

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,609
only I also did not say fudge so I'm

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,729
having this conversation trying to

00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:37,190
justify why didn't have a stupid frickin

00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:39,739
shirt was worth like I wasn't going to

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,749
use didn't have the money to pay off

00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:45,529
even if I did use it because again

00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:46,969
eighteen year old Steve let me tell you

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:51,759
that's a conversation I would rather

00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:51,759
never have again so far so good

00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:56,059
I tell you this all to remind you that

00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,759
teenagers don't always make the best

00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,989
decisions I certainly didn't I'm

00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,269
guessing that you probably made some

00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:04,579
mistakes in your youth too so think back

00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,129
to when you were younger if Facebook

00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:09,199
approached you and said hey we'd like to

00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:11,989
pay you we want to give you this free

00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:14,539
VPN hell it's so free will even pay you

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:17,359
to install it would you have taken them

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:21,889
up on the offer I can tell you that guy

00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:25,039
would have but now what if you were on

00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:28,159
the other side and you were working for

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,729
Facebook sure developing a performant

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,319
easy to install easy to run VPN if

00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:34,369
people have used to be PN's they know

00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,639
they're not always the most

00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:39,679
user-friendly thing that could be a

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:41,599
really fun challenge hey I'm going to

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,799
make VPNs more prevalent I'm going to

00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,019
put this out there people are going to

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,389
be able to be on VPNs and be secured and

00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:50,929
it's going to be wonderful and then you

00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:52,940
remember oh yeah Facebook and then you

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,999
get told hello by the way we're going to

00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:00,619
need you to steal all sorts of data if

00:25:55,999 --> 00:26:01,940
the Terms of Service basically say hey

00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:03,889
we're going to let you use this for free

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,950
but we're going to extract as much data

00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:09,589
as we possibly can is that something

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,290
that you as as a developer as a product

00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,200
manager

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,510
as a project manager as as an SEO person

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,050
as a business person is that something

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:21,210
that you can feel comfortable with again

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,280
Facebook has done a lot for open source

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,500
software and it's supposed to have this

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,880
amazing engineering culture but that

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,340
doesn't mean that Facebook's

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,750
a good company working for Facebook

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,600
doesn't make you a bad person either

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,610
we're not our companies after all but we

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,100
have to weigh the good and the bad in

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:44,430
what we do and see how our contributions

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:48,570
are pushing the needle another company

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:57,510
that has a not so sterling reputation is

00:26:48,570 --> 00:27:00,270
a ride-sharing giant called uber in 2017

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:02,970
news of uber is grayble program broke

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:07,440
the general idea was essentially to flag

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:12,660
users that uber felt had the wherewithal

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:15,390
or the means to violate or more like or

00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,970
more accurately undermine ubers Terms of

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,320
Service

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,500
city officials or anyone else who might

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,600
try to go after Ober for any number of

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,460
violations would end up getting served a

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,860
fake version of the app they'd get fake

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,060
data fake drivers they'd be like oh I

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,610
just can never seem to get in over

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,980
what's going on with this now let's be

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,480
clear this wasn't your friendly

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,560
neighborhood uber driver just kind of

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,030
going like yeah I'm not gonna pick up

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,340
any fares right now this was something

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,460
built into the application pushed out

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,240
from the top to help protect movers

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,770
interests the way that uber was flagging

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,900
people who could you know potentially

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,000
undermine them was really fascinating

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,440
though if I'm being honest in an expose

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,510
by the New York Times we learned a few

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,030
ways that were red flag potential city

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,710
official they would do some geo fencing

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,960
around government offices basically if

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,340
you were in a government office and you

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,000
were pretty regularly like opening the

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,710
app but they're not ordering ride they

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,030
figured okay they're just trying to see

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,480
if people are around they're doing

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,460
research on us and they're doing it near

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,990
a government office so we're going to go

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,980
ahead and flag them as someone who's

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,070
probably a government employee

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,780
uber would also reportedly

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,210
of the financial institutions linked to

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,160
customers credit cards if your card is

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,780
tied to a police credit union for

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,400
example there's a good chance that

00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,710
you're either a law enforcement officer

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,000
or you're related to one there's also a

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:41,020
good chance that at this time you could

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,700
not get an uber the expose even revealed

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,440
that uber would go as far as keeping a

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,710
catalogue of some of the most

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,300
inexpensive smartphones available

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,160
you know the prepaid stuff you'd get at

00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,050
the grocery store because cops aren't

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,090
going to spend big money on expensive

00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:59,320
burner phones if they're running a sting

00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,690
operation I'll confess from an OPSEC

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,840
perspective reading this was really like

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:07,170
oh that's really cool like it sucks it

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,960
is really unethical and everything but I

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:13,240
mean it's an interesting fun sounding

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,730
challenge it's like a game of cat and

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,750
mouse or cops and robbers except I guess

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,090
in this case you're actually going

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,430
against the cops which makes it less of

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,520
like a fun game and more of a criminal

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,320
racket but I can empathize with the

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,240
developers who thought this would be a

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,040
great challenge to solve how do we

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,800
determine what users might fit into each

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,850
cohort it's a fun analytical puzzle and

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,650
it's something that's great if for

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,620
instance you're trying to serve more

00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,760
relevant content to your users it's a

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,150
little different when you're using it to

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,640
evade law enforcement though and with

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,110
that kind of profiling algorithm it's

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,540
not hard to let our imaginations run

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,130
wild as to like wow what groups might

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,370
they exclude from being able to get an

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,740
uber next I'm not going to stand up here

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,510
and tell you these are bad companies and

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,310
you shouldn't work for them that's

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,890
that's not my place and I understand

00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,940
that sometimes we take jobs because that

00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,040
we're not a hundred percent cool with

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,250
because you know we need to put food on

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,870
the table what I would like to do is

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,250
challenge you to find the good in what

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,260
you're doing and make sure that the good

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,700
isn't being outweighed by the bad if

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,290
you're in a situation where your

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,150
contributions are being used to cause

00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,540
harm then I implore you as the good

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,640
person that you presumably are to make a

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,510
stand

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,610
speaking out for standing your ground

00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,050
against bad actors is rarely easy and I

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:33,820
absolutely recognize the irony of me a

00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,380
middle-class cisgender straight white

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,170
male standing up here and telling you

00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,890
don't not people push you around

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,140
it hurts the the irony is so sharp it

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,600
hurts but we can't all just quit our

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,890
jobs as much as we might like to if you

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,470
live somewhere where the job market

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,780
isn't great it can be absolutely

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:56,050
terrifying to stand up and say I object

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,780
to what we're doing again fuzzies aren't

00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:01,270
going to put food on the table so what

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,670
can we do if we're stuck working for a

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,580
company that upsets our stomach how can

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,470
we find purpose in it does the job offer

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,000
training or educational opportunities

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,790
that we can use to better a situation

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,370
it's not unheard of as Dustin was saying

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,650
for people to go to conferences meet new

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,900
people and then have those connections

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,150
lead to their next job that's one of the

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,540
big benefits of going to something like

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:28,900
this word camp remember if I hadn't just

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,910
bought a house when I met Ana in at

00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,910
South by Southwest I might be living in

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,170
DC working for three spot right now are

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,690
there other good people in the company

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:39,160
who you can connect with and learn from

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,570
the company might not be a good company

00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,150
but if you're working for someone at the

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,650
scale of Facebook or uber chances are

00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,080
they're probably employing some pretty

00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,120
smart people if you're working in

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,850
marketing for instance and you have the

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,460
opportunity to work side along so work

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,800
alongside people doing you know like big

00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,630
multinational campaigns that's an

00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,380
amazing learning opportunity take

00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,820
advantage of that maybe the meaning in

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,580
what you're doing is the personal growth

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,310
yeah that project was really rough and

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,860
you know you got reprimanded by your

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,080
manager or the higher-ups or whatever

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:18,220
because it shipped late or it went

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,870
over-budget or whatever but maybe it was

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,750
a less than successful launch because

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,070
you had to dive really deep learn some

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,990
new technology you've never worked with

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,180
before and now you can leverage that

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:32,170
knowledge and that experience in your

00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,670
next project or in your next job they

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,680
say a mistake is only a mistake if you

00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,640
don't learn from it can the same be said

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,960
about a bad project if you're in a bad

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,730
situation that you can't get out of

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,240
right now try to find ways to make that

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,150
bad situation

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,030
to be clear on one hand absolutely not

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:53,650
advocating that you like go steal

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:56,390
company secrets or start some rogue

00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,140
Twitter account to you know be a

00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,650
whistleblower

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,150
I mean maybe don't not be a

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,320
whistleblower with some rogue account

00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,560
because those are a lot of fun to follow

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,180
but what I'm saying is find a way to

00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,100
make your employment at least mutually

00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,260
beneficial remember the company is

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:18,080
paying for your time and your talents

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:20,330
but the company doesn't own you you can

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,310
look outside of your company too maybe

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,290
you can't drop the nine-to-five right

00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,300
now but you have some time outside of

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,610
work to volunteer maybe a local

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,200
nonprofit can use your skills or you can

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,990
spend some time writing blog posts to

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,760
help teach other people if I may share a

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,890
little secret one of the best ways to

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,040
learn something really well is to have

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,380
to try to teach it to somebody else if

00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,910
you've ever been afraid like oh but I

00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,220
don't have enough experience to do this

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,050
try getting up on stage and saying oh

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,490
let me pretend to be an expert here

00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,400
you're going to learn that thing really

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,840
well so you don't look like an ass

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,180
that's personally what I do with every

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,940
one of my my technical talks so please

00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:02,690
join us after lunch for my my second

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,610
talk of the day if you're interested in

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,590
speaking maybe try with your local

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,730
meetups they're often looking for

00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,370
speakers and you'll be able to share

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:14,020
what you've learned for groups that are

00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:16,100
local to you and help those people grow

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,630
once you've spoken at a few local

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,690
meetups maybe take that show on the road

00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,370
employers are often happy to send you to

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,500
conferences it's it's time away from

00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,300
work but they get to look like you know

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,540
progressive thought leaders and you're

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,550
like haha time to travel and hang out

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,790
and it's your name on the marquee at the

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,840
end of the day if you're looking for a

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,210
way to get out of your current job

00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,250
sharing what you know can be a great way

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,740
to do that it helps put you on other

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:46,400
people's radars whether it's blogging or

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:49,430
speaking YouTube videos writing for

00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,500
magazines publishing ebooks being known

00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:53,550
for being a teacher can open far more

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,520
doors than most jobs can on there

00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,560
if teaching is not your thing find some

00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,810
other ways to better yourself pick up a

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,880
new skill make some new connections

00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,350
reach out to local user groups and maybe

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
try to get your company to sponsor them

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,860
I mean after all if Facebook is going to

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,300
steal like all of our data they should

00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,300
at least buy some pizza first right

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,420
sweet coffee so we've learned how to

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,640
either reframe what we're doing to find

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,840
the deeper meaning or to jump ship and

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,290
find something that actually makes a

00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,660
difference why is this important now at

00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,300
the most basic level it provides that

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,030
simple gratification that validation

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,960
knowing that the time and energy that

00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,630
we've spent hasn't been wasted we've

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,940
solved somebody's problem we've we've

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,130
helped someone go further we've had

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,600
someone go faster we've reduced

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,710
someone's pain all of those reasons

00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,040
Chris was talking about

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,290
we've helped somebody do something we've

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,240
done something for somebody else and yes

00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,550
sometimes that somebody else we can be

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,770
selfish in it yeah yeah I helped myself

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,760
but a lot of times we're helping other

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,860
people or a group of people you feel

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,200
good because your time was spent making

00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,940
the world a better place and that

00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,350
doesn't mean that you can't and

00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,080
shouldn't be compensated for your work

00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:19,170
but you've applied your skills and your

00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,420
talent to help somebody it's an amazing

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,210
feeling isn't it you want to find

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,040
purpose in what you do maybe try looking

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,480
beyond your personal life experiences

00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,430
and try to think about how your talents

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,680
can be used to help somebody else to

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,390
have empathy is to show understanding of

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,810
and relate to how other people are

00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,720
feeling

00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:44,640
if someone's upset you're there for them

00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:46,140
with more than just a friendly okay you

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,840
try to put yourself in their position

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,570
and understands why they're feeling the

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,060
way they are especially before you try

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,870
to offer advice maybe something's really

00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,550
easy for you but other people aren't you

00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:01,530
in short empathy is being willing to put

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,160
other people's problems ahead of your

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,770
own even just for a moment by taking

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,620
time to empathize with others there

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,540
their struggles their pains you're far

00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,790
more likely to be able to come up with

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,440
better solutions and better ways to help

00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,630
people because you can see the problem

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,250
from their perspective if you take

00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,570
everything that you know right now and I

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,310
don't care if you're a developer if

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,720
you're a project manager if you're a

00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:26,600
business person if you're strategist

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,500
whatever take what you know right now

00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:35,270
and imagine one of your clients problems

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,130
or one of your customers problems look

00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,350
at it through them how they would be

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,320
seeing it but with the lens of all of it

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,950
what you know you're able to look at

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,660
them and you're able to say I understand

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:49,790
how you feel or where you're struggling

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,770
and here's how I can help they're gonna

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,360
think you have superpowers because

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,800
you're able to take your experiences and

00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:59,780
funnel it through their perspective

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,670
empathy also leads to better work how

00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,710
many stories have we heard about some

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,800
well-meaning app that made it easier for

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,060
for instance someone who gets talked

00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,680
having empathy is looking critically at

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,600
an idea no matter how good the

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,030
intentions are and asking how could this

00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,460
be used to hurt someone if you don't

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,930
know look around the room talk about the

00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,940
the idea with people who don't share

00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,280
your same life experiences or your

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:25,880
privilege and most of all listen to what

00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:28,640
these people have to say closely paired

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,560
with empathy is compassion doing good

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,950
for others without expecting anything in

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,980
return

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,010
life isn't some business transaction or

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,270
quid pro quo

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,010
sometimes you'll put good out into the

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,530
world and nothing will come of it

00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,460
but at the end of the day I don't know

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,980
about you but I sleep much better

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,390
knowing that I've tried my best to make

00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,960
the world a better place rather than

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,670
just shrug people off again I'm not

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,200
saying you need to go out there and do

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,820
this stuff for free put your mask on

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,470
before helping others after all but

00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,840
having a bit of empathy and compassion

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:03,230
that can make all of the difference to

00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:06,710
someone let's talk about accessibility

00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:09,830
for a moment I'm very fortunate in a lot

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,560
of ways but physically I have for

00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,850
mobility full use of my senses even my

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,790
glasses aren't that strong

00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:18,740
I have no colorblindness no dyslexia

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,569
physically speaking nothing that I could

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,150
claim as a quote disability

00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,529
now let's take my right arm away being

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,689
right-handed that's going to be a

00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:29,119
hindrance and maybe my left arm isn't

00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:30,499
great at holding things steady so your

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,479
click targets better be big enough that

00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:33,829
I'm not fat fingering cancel every time

00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:37,640
I try to order repeats it through your

00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:40,939
app take away my glasses I'm not able to

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,799
read the text ok now blindfold me am I

00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:45,199
able to navigate your your sight your

00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:47,390
application using assistive technology

00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,309
like a screen reader now take off the

00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,019
blindfold give me my glasses back but

00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:52,999
take away my ability to discern in color

00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:55,369
am I going to be able to tell at a

00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:57,679
glance the difference between a major

00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,329
error notification and like a hey your

00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,469
thing was updated successfully a good

00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:05,839
job type message in your app am I going

00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:09,429
to be able to find the links if I can't

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,959
tell black from blue in your body copy

00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:13,640
empathy means putting yourself in other

00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:16,339
people's shoes and seeing what issues

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,319
they might run into not everybody is as

00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:20,569
fortunate as I am but if I build a piece

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,549
of software that for instance can't be

00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:25,999
navigated with a keyboard well that's on

00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:28,130
me accessibility isn't a feature and

00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,539
treating it as such is a slap in the

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,709
face of everyone who can't use your

00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:35,059
software I don't know how to explain to

00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:35,659
you that you should care about other

00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:38,059
people

00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:40,339
this was the headline of a story on

00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:42,589
Huffington Post On June 26th my dad's

00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:44,029
birthday 2017 and it captured the

00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:48,589
feeling that accessibility advocates

00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:50,900
have been feeling well forever caring

00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:54,349
about other people is in a weakness it's

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,599
not some add-on or premium extra giving

00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:57,919
a about the people around us should

00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,499
be table stakes if we're building

00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:02,650
software creating content or in any way

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:05,059
being a part of the society

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,589
accessibility matters because empathy

00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:10,329
matters because people matter

00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,329
never forget that please

00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,710
I suppose what I'm trying to say in all

00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,860
of this is that ultimately most of the

00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:23,500
software we write isn't exactly busting

00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,060
at the seams with purpose if we want to

00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,880
be able to look back at how we've spent

00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,830
our lives we need to recognize this I

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,540
don't want to be 80 years old and

00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,850
telling my grandchildren about all of

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:37,080
the garbage cheeseburgers I helped sell

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:41,080
I don't want to spend 40 hours a week

00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:44,740
2,000 hours a year building stuff that

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,780
doesn't matter so we can find purpose in

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,490
what we create think about the the

00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,680
people that employs the mouths it feeds

00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,480
the anguish it relieves the the

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,210
communities it can help create and

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,380
support or we can find something to do

00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,390
that we can be proud of

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,010
no matter the path we owe it to

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,960
ourselves as professionals to practice

00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,480
empathy and everything we do if you're

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:11,110
not helping somebody in need what are

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:12,780
you doing by meaning in what you do or

00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:16,290
find something that does have purpose

00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,450
either way move forward with empathy

00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:22,030
again I really don't like to be cheesy

00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,080
with my message but we only get one

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,150
chance of this life

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,860
we can choose to be a force for good a

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,230
force for evil or just hang out

00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,750
somewhere in between but I don't know

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:33,460
about all of you but I'd much rather

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,860
spend my life trying to find a way to

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,570
put good into the world then selling

00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,940
garbage or making other people's lives

00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,040
more difficult the software that we
