	00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,990
all right we're gonna talk about why

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,680
it's important to be mobile first over

00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,799
mobile friendly today when you see this

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,680
picture what do you see a lighthouse

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,310
obviously lighthouse you know it guides

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,310
it warn ships that are at sea I see

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,410
something else though I also see a tool

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,769
that is guiding your site to be mobile

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,449
first this is Google lighthouse which is

00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,720
the new PageSpeed algorithm that they

00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:37,079
come out specifically for mobile devices

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,600
the purpose is to improve the quality of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,100
websites specifically mobile

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,250
however if something like this is

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,129
important to Google then that means that

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,820
it's only a matter of time before it

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:53,199
affects your website right now

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,440
mobile-friendly sites are what Google is

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,960
prioritizing but the lighthouse check it

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,079
makes sure that you have a mobile first

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,850
website and so we can kind of see the

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,640
writing on the wall as to the direction

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,009
that Google is going to be taking so to

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,569
get started we're gonna talk how did we

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,640
get to this point we're gonna do a quick

00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:17,369
overview of what's happened in basically

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:22,000
the last 25 years of the search industry

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,920
so 15 to 25 years ago you had lots of

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,569
different search engines and most of

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,849
them were more or less directory sites

00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:29,200
where you would submit your site or

00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:31,509
someone else would submit it and it

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,509
would take the title the description the

00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,060
keywords and it would use that to go and

00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:39,429
put up the information when someone

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,920
would do a search eventually they

00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:43,780
started to personalize these sites where

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,300
you might have your own homepage you'd

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,039
get a weather widget you might have some

00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,349
local news that would appear on the side

00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:52,179
but more or less the results were all

00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:55,090
pretty much just what was in the

00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:57,849
directory at the time now when I was in

00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,489
high school in the early 2000s Google it

00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,920
was a thing but it wasn't a household

00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:07,390
verb no one really used it all the time

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,590
so in 2005 Google decided to start to

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,000
attempt to make sure that we had actual

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,390
personalized search results it would

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,930
launch that it launched the personalized

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,599
search results based

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,659
what our search history was and it would

00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,879
use that to fight spam tactics that had

00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:28,579
already come out from I guess search

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,689
marketers it really helped bring Google

00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:36,829
out as a big player so two years later

00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:39,230
in 2007 they added Universal Search and

00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:43,390
this is where they combined the results

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:47,420
of the links with local news books

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,620
movies and it made it so that when you

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,120
would search or something you wouldn't

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,030
just get webpages but you might actually

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,209
get relevant content the goal was to

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,310
provide more value to us as users this

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,069
is also the year that the iPhone came

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,060
out which pretty much changed how we now

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:08,810
develop websites today so in 2008 Google

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,430
added suggested search results so there

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,319
really was a time where Google is pretty

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,060
much like a regular wordpress search you

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,980
actually had to type out exactly what

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,349
you want to search for and hit enter now

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,439
it's second nature we start to type what

00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:23,859
we want and then we just select what

00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,169
makes the most sense go with that

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,810
once again the goal is to add more value

00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:33,349
to us this is also when duck duck duck

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,169
Duck Duck Go came out which gave Google

00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,090
some much-needed competition and it's

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:42,769
also when the first Android device was

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:45,220
released in 2009 Google added real-time

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:48,049
search results so it started to grab

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,209
results from Twitter Facebook other

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,069
social media and that way we'd have a

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,949
search come through we would actually

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,239
know something that happened within the

00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:59,659
last minute within the last couple

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,510
seconds once again the goal is to give

00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:04,699
us as users more value this is also

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,129
there that Bing came out where it was

00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,599
rebranded from live search which I guess

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:13,549
a year before that was Windows Live

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:15,470
search in 2010 the caffeine update came

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,199
out and that was where Google folks

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,209
focused on speeding up how fast you

00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,709
could get that information they went

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,720
through and just made it so that it was

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,570
more performant and it's interesting

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,610
because here you're at a time where

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,460
everyone is focusing on how long people

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,180
can stay on their website and Google is

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,889
focused on

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,770
how fast they can get you off of their

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,750
website knowing that if you leave their

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,060
website fast you might have gotten what

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,180
you want and you're gonna come back the

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,759
goal was for user experience and also to

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,550
get ahead of the competition this is

00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,690
also the year that the iPad was released

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,210
in 2011 was when the panda updates came

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,280
out and that is where low quality

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,830
content was dropped as well as sites

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,610
that had way too many ads to the content

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:07,789
ratio this is where substantial ratings

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,889
actually were affected because 12% of

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:13,250
all search traffic was affected by the

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:17,599
Panda updates and the goal was for

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:20,210
better user experience for us in 2012

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,919
the Penguin updates came out and this is

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,449
where Google started to punish sites

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,940
that had that would buy links or they

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,440
would stuff keywords into the site this

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,729
is also when the knowledge graph came

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,190
out and if you don't know what that is

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,830
when you search for say a celebrity then

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,830
you will have on the right side where it

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,320
will actually give you the the Wikipedia

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,180
bio you might have a picture of them you

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,530
might have some movies that they've been

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,320
in maybe colleagues or something like

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,820
that and the whole goal is to provide us

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:56,330
with information as fast as possible

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,280
in 2013 we had more updates to penguin

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,039
which combat spam but also the

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,349
hummingbird release came out and that

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,449
was where Google went and rewrote their

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:07,639
algorithm from scratch so it was the

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,009
first time they had done this since 2001

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,990
and the biggest feature that came with

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,909
this was conversational search so you

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,330
could actually ask a question to Google

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:19,039
how do I do this and it would know what

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,259
words to parse out okay you're asking a

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,409
question here's the main focus and

00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:29,720
provide quality content to you once

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:31,789
again for the user 2014 was where the

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,009
pigeon update came out and that pulled

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:36,199
data from your location and maybe

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,630
synonyms of local words that you might

00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,090
use that aren't used in other areas to

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,580
try to generate search results for you

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,490
so if you're here in Dayton and you're

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,900
searching for something and

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,520
searching for the exact same thing in

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,099
California you're gonna get different

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,639
results based on where it is that you're

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:57,599
making that search from as always the

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,639
goal was for a better user experience in

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,550
2015 was the dreaded mobilegeddon update

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,849
phones are becoming more popular at this

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,150
time and mobile-friendly sites they rank

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,310
better for google now this is where

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,319
Google also started to use machine

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,919
learning and artificial intelligence as

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,680
a ranking factor behind the results now

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,979
the goal once again more relevant

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,870
results for us but giving a bonus to

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:30,580
sites that are accessible across all

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,880
devices in 2016 the possum update came

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,669
out which is another local update and

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,460
this made it so that you had more

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:43,000
results that would change based on our

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,130
location so if I was in Beaver Creek

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,880
which is a town just outside of Dayton

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:52,419
and I'm searching for a restaurant using

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,719
the keyword with Dayton then Google

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,580
would also provide provide restaurants

00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,530
that are in Beaver Creek closer to me

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,030
they're also trying to rank for Dayton

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,550
and it managed to figure out the

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,969
location providing closer results for

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,729
you more accurate for you I also want to

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:12,400
point out that this is the year that the

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:15,610
iPhone 5se was released which is the

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,229
last semi popular phone that has a

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:22,750
viewport width of 320 pixels and this is

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:29,440
also the year that phone usage passed

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:31,870
and desktop usage for online use in 2017

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,870
there were sites that had excessive

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,740
pop-ups or ads they also got punished

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,229
and there were the updates were all

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,180
unconfirmed and so we're assuming

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,370
they're pretty much just unnamed Panda

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,240
and Penguin updates to provoke content

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,770
and quality content and get rid of spam

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,220
but it continued the trend that the

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,949
values for the user in 28:18 just this

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,930
last year the main rankings for suck

00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:01,360
search it switched to Google

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,330
smart BOTS or Google Google BOTS

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,970
smartphone which means that desktop was

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,240
officially second in the ranking factor

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:14,230
that Google was using for all results

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,240
PageSpeed algorithm was also a bigger

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,970
factor that was used so Google wanted

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,540
faster sites then just this past

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:26,470
November was when lighthouse became the

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,440
main ranking factor for mobile for

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,770
Google and for part of their page speak

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,820
out rhythm and once again the value is

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,640
for buses of people to have a better

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,670
internet experience so back to this

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,560
photo this is lighthouse it's the

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,680
guiding force to help make your website

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,750
and better specifically to improve the

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,610
experience for your mobile visitors also

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,290
this is for Google I mean it's going to

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,950
help your search rank better if you

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:03,400
follow it but this is for Google and

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,950
Google as we know it has the the famous

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,900
algorithm where you don't know what it

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,440
is that it's actually doing and they're

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,850
not releasing any of that information so

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,220
how do you make use of it when it seems

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,209
like it's completely untouchable is this

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,220
something that we're just like

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:22,180
completely completely frozen out from

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:26,230
with access so what is a mobile-friendly

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,100
website I've been making websites since

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,130
I was a kid

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,779
maybe not quite that little I was

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,070
probably more that age and those aren't

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,660
my best years so we're just gonna move

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:40,930
on but mid to late 90s I was creating

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,890
websites and I made them for a computer

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,550
obviously nothing else now the sites

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,180
that I made

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,470
they looked absolutely terrible and so

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,240
did everything else on the internet

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,040
because we didn't know any better if we

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,160
were just trying out and seeing what

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,300
worked and at that point I remember I

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,760
was hoping that I could develop

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,899
something for sites that were bigger

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,810
than 640 pixels wide and I remember

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,940
putting an image that was 1024 saying

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,529
your lager needs to be this wide so that

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,610
you can view everything on this and make

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,380
people search

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,120
we didn't care about users we weren't I

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,769
don't know we just weren't very good in

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,600
the beginning

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,300
eventually you had BlackBerry's come out

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,880
palm devices and they had a browser in

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,890
them but no one actually used the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,370
internet that way and so we didn't have

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,500
to cater to him and then 2007 happened

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,130
with a literal breakthrough of the

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,620
iPhone the good news for anyone who is

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,870
making websites is the iPhone it wasn't

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,899
super common and it was pretty expensive

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:48,630
for people to use and so we still didn't

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:52,060
necessarily care about those users and

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,779
besides I wanted to make websites for

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,510
bigger screens not for smaller screens

00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:00,970
so eventually you had Android phones

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,459
come out you had the iPhone the iPod

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,829
Touch come out windows smartphones came

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,630
and then they eventually went away

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:10,120
eventually everyone had smartphones and

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,209
we actually needed to cater to them we

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,339
needed to start thinking about people

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:16,720
because we didn't want little tiny sites

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,220
that were inside of the phone that

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,300
people would have to pinch and zoom and

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,100
swipe around to actually read an article

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,990
so people started to make separate

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,079
mobile websites that had like the M

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,910
subdomain or mobile subdomain and you

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,620
had two separate code bases that you

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,820
actually need to maintain some people

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,620
actually have two separate WordPress

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,029
installs you'd have to make sure that

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,220
you copy things from one to the other

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,410
eventually there were some plugins that

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,300
came out that would sniff what device

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,790
was being used and it would switch the

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,740
mobile theme but there was still a lot

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,690
of work in maintaining between two

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,790
separate things eventually browser

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,930
started to support more mobile queries

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:01,660
more more media queries and we're still

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,149
would design for the desktop but then as

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,250
the screen size would get smaller the

00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,470
page would adjust paid you to just

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,060
smaller and we'd set up breakpoints

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,070
according to the viewport so that way

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,070
people could access the content that we

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,470
I guess felt was appropriate the site

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,540
was built for desktop but it was still

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,660
friendly to mobile that is a mobile

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,990
friendly website but what is mobile

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,540
first mobile first obviously

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,270
is just the reverse it's where we build

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,029
for mobile and then we expand up into

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,600
desktop but what is the point of

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:41,050
actually going mobile first so quick

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,779
survey who here is used a desktop or a

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,779
laptop computer to access the Internet

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,390
today and of course in some at a tech

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,300
conference I see a lot of hands up who

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:56,520
here is used a smartphone to access the

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,520
Internet today Hey look every hand is up

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,399
so in 2018 a survey found that 52 point

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,160
two percent of all worldwide online

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:11,890
traffic it came from mobile devices in

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,930
Twitter in 2018 57% of people say that

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,660
they wouldn't recommend a business that

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,180
had a poorly designed website here's the

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,970
kicker though that survey right there is

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,990
from 2011 so that number is likely

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,510
higher today in that same 2011 survey

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,760
you had 40% of people say that they went

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,870
to a competitor's website when they had

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,360
a bad experience on another web site so

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,350
you probably already knew this but

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,839
mobile is important

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:45,880
Google thinks it's important and people

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:49,000
think it's important but why is it

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,690
important to go mobile first the first

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,010
is load time a site that's coded to be

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,480
desktop first it first loads all the

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,270
styles that need to be done for the

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,880
desktop and it loads all the CSS for

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,399
that and then it adds the extra CSS for

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,990
the tablet view and the mobile view and

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,420
everything that's in there and then you

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,329
have to have the browser parse through

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,540
all that to find out okay this is what

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:19,270
is needed for the mobile display our

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,770
browsers on our phones they are not as

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,020
performant as browsers that are on

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,029
computers so it actually takes longer

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,899
for the browser to parse through all of

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,670
that also a lot of times if it's not

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,860
actually put on properly

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,140
it hasn't been encoded properly you

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,959
might have an element that is hidden on

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,030
a mobile device but it is still actually

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,640
loading

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:47,790
and still downloading in the backend on

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:51,300
that same mobile device which slows down

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:55,130
your load time now mobile first it

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:58,740
builds the code so that way everything

00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,990
is built with the mobile and then as you

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,330
get into the larger browsers on

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,180
computers which are more performant then

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,660
it's actually going to parse in all that

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,570
extra data and the other thing is you

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,510
think about phones sometimes we're

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,970
connected to Wi-Fi devices or connected

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,000
to Wi-Fi other times we're using mobile

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,330
data and that right there is generally

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,910
slower than the Wi-Fi computers they're

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,530
almost always on Wi-Fi or wired into an

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,840
internet connection so the Internet is

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,730
also faster on computers which means we

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,770
really need to cater to these mobile

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:40,080
users the next is design most designers

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,360
when they're building for a website at

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,640
least in the past they were building it

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,230
on a computer they wanted to max out

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,210
that real-estate and then the

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,690
stakeholders who were approving it we're

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,610
looking at it on a computer and that's

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,220
what gets approved and at the end oh we

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,390
have to have a mobile-friendly site so

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,060
everything gets squished down and thrown

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,620
in and Mobile is the afterthought there

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,829
never was a user experience that was

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,290
actually tailored to the mobile user

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:11,339
because all that we had to worry about

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,079
was desktop mobile first it reverses

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,630
that where you actually have to focus on

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,160
the experience of the mobile user you

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,060
start by building that so that way you

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,970
can see everything that most people are

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,500
looking at your site with and then since

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,020
you're still having to worry about

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,360
desktop you build it up and you have a

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,570
full experience start to finish from

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,980
both sides so who should have the better

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,380
experience who do you want to make

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,880
happier the mobile users or the desktop

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,440
users both are important and you might

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,040
have data that says that you have like

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
98% desktop traffic and if that's case

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,680
go for the desktop but currently with

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,150
most sites mobile has the edge and

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,740
looks like it's only gonna get bigger

00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:01,950
from that point so how do you run google

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,280
lighthouse for me I have a script that I

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:09,510
run that performs the lighthouse audit

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,340
on a site and then it generates an HTML

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,160
report for me and that way I'm able to

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,100
see how everything is working but that's

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,790
not the easiest for just any beginner to

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,230
set up and so if you want the full

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,270
explanation come talk to me afterwards

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,760
and I can kind of show you how a my

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,970
setup is but there's a way that you can

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,980
do it just from the browser there's the

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,480
URL that has the instructions yes these

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,660
slides will be posted so you don't have

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,820
to copy it down but use Chrome because

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,460
it's from Google so they're requiring

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,040
that you use their own browser and you

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,530
open the dev tools which is ctrl shift J

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,700
on a PC or command option J on a Mac and

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,670
then there's a little tab that says

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,470
audits you click on that and you click

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,780
to perform an audit and you have a bunch

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,640
of little check boxes on there just

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,990
check everything for the first thing

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,120
because that will give you the full

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,430
mobile report and then you click run on

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,140
it there's an easier way though if you

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:09,270
install the Google lighthouse Chrome and

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,860
SEC and I can't talk extension then you

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,700
just click the little icon at the top

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,740
corner of the browser and it will say

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,850
generate report you click that and it

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,259
will actually give you the report that

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:27,769
you need yes

00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:30,259
yes yep so with Google PageSpeed

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:33,469
insights when you run that you will see

00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:34,969
a mobile tab and a desktop tab the

00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:36,950
desktop is their general PageSpeed

00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:40,029
insights that they have the mobile tab

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,409
just runs the performance section of

00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:44,149
lighthouse in the score it doesn't run

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:48,469
the full report of lighthouse that

00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:51,229
they're using so what is the scoring

00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:55,249
looking for each of those sections are

00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:56,839
scored from 0 to 100 and it's just gonna

00:19:55,249 --> 00:20:00,589
check the mobile version of your site

00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,820
nothing else and their scoring icons

00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,190
that they have it doesn't make much

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:08,269
sense because it's color coded where it

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,389
says green is 90 to 100 but then the

00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:12,830
scores actually have the color with the

00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:16,279
numbers on so I don't understand why it

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,859
says it but generally good is 90 to 100

00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,099
which is green yellow which is just no

00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:28,099
case scores 50 to 89 and a poor score is

00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:29,989
0 to 49 and the things that it starts to

00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:32,570
check for is performance then this is

00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:36,109
what is being checked in mobile or the

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,749
mobile PageSpeed insights right now so

00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:41,509
how fast does your light does your site

00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:43,369
load for a mobile site to Google

00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:47,179
generally says that it needs to load in

00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:49,789
under 3 seconds and be done it also says

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:53,149
that for the first content paint it

00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:56,419
needs to load in under 1.6 seconds this

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:59,089
means that when you click something to

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:00,950
access your site in the first second and

00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:03,979
a half you need to have something appear

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,169
on the screen that fast so how do we

00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:08,809
decrease that load time and increase

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:11,989
that performance score the first is

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:15,169
obviously mobile front may earth mobile

00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:16,700
first development and design and if

00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:18,529
you're a developer these are just some

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,899
sass media queries you can use them if

00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,789
you want you can look but it's basically

00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:25,159
some variables and then the usage

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,070
provided on how I've been doing mobile

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,169
first websites now there might be

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,359
overkill because I've got probably about

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,609
9000 variables listed so you can choose

00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,690
the way that you want but everything is

00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,190
covered

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,500
there is one note and that's why I

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,370
wanted to point out about that iPhone

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,900
5se which at work we call Ethan's tiny

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,720
stupid iPhone Ethan is one of my

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,700
co-workers who actually has the phone I

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,250
work in ad tech and we have a

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,380
requirement that ads which are 300

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,630
pixels are not white or not allowed to

00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,850
be cut off so those are a standard size

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,880
that's shown on mobile devices if you

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,350
have a phone that's 320 pixels wide then

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,240
you have to worry about margins and when

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,620
it's going into people's themes we have

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,410
to adjust things so that it actually

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,530
works properly true mobile first would

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:14,630
be to cater to this iPhone 5se and then

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,180
start to move out to normal mobile phone

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,330
sizes but the way that I do development

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,270
is I actually cater to all mobile

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,220
devices and then those couple media

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,410
queries for the 5s see those come in

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,350
after the fact the reason being I don't

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,450
want to load just this and have that

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,520
parsed along with the normal mobile

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,920
queries when I don't have to I'm

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,350
catering to where most of the traffic is

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,880
next is to have a quality theme

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,430
basically have no bloat

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,110
you know those amazing one-size-fits-all

00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,030
themes that will load 17 different

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,340
sliders and you can have all the

00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,010
different color options that you want

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:57,230
those are the worst why because they're

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,200
loading way too much CSS way too much

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,140
JavaScript and they a lot of them are

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,000
making lots and lots of database calls

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,130
just to build your page not gonna

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,910
publicly shame any of them but recently

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,830
I was asked to optimize a site that was

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,620
on one of these really popular themes

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:17,210
and it also was on one of the top

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,330
hosting plans that are out there so it

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:23,000
should be running fast the theme took

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,610
three seconds alone just to build the

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,340
homepage on every single time that

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,440
anyone accessed it and that is just from

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,080
the database calls that were made to

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,240
pull in everything to build that page I

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,150
mean I managed to get some caching

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,130
thrown on behind it and drop that

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,770
response but it still took a lot longer

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,200
than what it should just because of how

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,580
slow that database was running because

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,040
of the theme that was on there I

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,310
switched the theme off to something else

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,990
and instantly things got faster but that

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,210
wasn't allowed so I had to go back to it

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,170
and that initial load time was terrible

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,900
make sure that you have a quality thing

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,310
which also applies to plugins plugins

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,680
that run on the front end

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,380
some of them will add their CSS code

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,670
they'll add their JavaScript code and

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,380
you might need it for just a simple

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:16,670
short code that you're displaying on one

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,340
single post but the plug-in has made it

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,650
so that they in queue that on every

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,360
single page and depending on the file

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,000
size of those you might have things that

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,070
are loading repeatedly on pages that

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,840
they don't even need to be on there be

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:34,340
careful what it is that you were putting

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,200
on your page good hosting you know the

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,920
old adage you get what you pay for that

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,500
is so true with hosting faster hosts

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,110
specifically ones that have been catered

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,230
to WordPress they make sure that they

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,060
optimize it as best as they can some who

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,830
will even cache some of the database

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,410
calls in memory making things faster for

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,840
you a lot of them will include content

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,190
delivery networks in their hosting

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,080
package so that way they can serve

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,020
assets faster they've been built so that

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,330
they will work with HTTP 2 which will

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,490
give faster resource service and they

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,190
have better uptime a lot of them include

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:13,220
free SSL Certificates which is required

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:17,180
for HTTP 2 do you have good hosting that

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:21,050
will also help improve your score image

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,810
optimization to do this just perform an

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:28,190
image audit on your site look at your

00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:30,020
home page look at the I don't know 10

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,180
most talked popular posts that you have

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,460
look at your pages and look at every

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,800
single image on there say to yourself

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,040
what is the purpose of this image does

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,080
it need to be here why is it here find

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,270
out if you have images that are too big

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,580
if you have something that is a 5,000

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,710
pixel image and for some reason that

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,650
5,000 pixel image is being loaded on the

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,260
site and it's only in the 700 pixel

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:57,140
width content area then you need to make

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,820
sure that image is size down optimize

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,370
your images beforehand whether you're

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,970
using that whether you're doing it

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,860
manual

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,420
by compressing them or using a service

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,840
that you can have where it does it when

00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:12,680
you upload to WordPress also if you lazy

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,810
load your images then it's going to make

00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,460
it so that it only loads the pages the

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,950
images right at the top in your viewport

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,890
and as you scroll it starts to load them

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,120
as they come in which will severely

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,960
decrease the load time that is needed

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,230
for your site initially and the last one

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,880
and this one is hard is remove jQuery I

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:37,400
know that 99% of themes and plugins use

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,200
it but if you can find the ones that

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,200
don't you're saving so much load time

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,600
specifically with mobile because the

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,360
browsers are more performant in desktops

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,220
when you are running jQuery something

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,230
will run like that but in mobile it

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,570
takes a lot longer to parse and a lot

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,550
longer to actually calculate what

00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,110
happens while if you're using just

00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,770
regular JavaScript vanilla JavaScript

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,900
then that loads a lot quicker as if it

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,860
was on jQuery on a desktop really

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,360
actually still faster so the next thing

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,170
that Google lighthouse is checking for

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,990
is a progressive web app when you're

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,210
using a social media app or a social

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,250
media company are you using the app that

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,560
comes on your phone or are you using the

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,450
browser and going through it obviously

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,390
people are using the app because it's

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,730
faster it's smoother you have push

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,920
notifications that come through but it's

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,890
more expensive to build it takes a lot

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,810
more work to build that app and so if

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,100
you have what's known as progressive web

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,860
app or a PWA

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,340
it essentially is turning your website

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:46,130
into an app your website it will run

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,780
like an app so what is the games that

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,870
you can have from having your site as a

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,630
progressive web app the first is that

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,430
it's reliable once your site has been

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,580
downloaded the site is going to load

00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:00,830
pretty much instantly even if your site

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,540
even if the user happens to be offline

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,610
they still can access your site and its

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,270
content through the use of what's called

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:11,270
a serviceworker then individual complete

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:13,400
pages can be cached and the developer

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,740
can even set up when that cache needs to

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,500
be updated so if a new post

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,770
come out or if you've updated a plug-in

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,860
then the version could be ticked and the

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,230
next time someone visits the page when

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,750
they're off when they're online it will

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,940
download the proper things and this also

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,330
will remove Network requests which means

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,030
that your site is going to be fast very

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,290
fast because if everything is cached and

00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,260
the site works offline

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,820
you're not making any extra calls no

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,670
matter what generation you're a part of

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:51,140
we're all feeling entitled to having a

00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:55,220
fast internet experience so I've been

00:28:51,140 --> 00:29:00,800
using Mac computers for a little over a

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:04,340
decade and recently I had to pull up my

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,780
old PC and this is nothing against pcs

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,309
it's just the technology that had on the

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,410
computer it was like 10 years old and

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,150
turn it on and it doesn't have

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,120
solid-state drive or anything like that

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:16,700
and I had to wait and wait and wait and

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,360
waiting that one it made me increase its

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:23,120
shouldn't've but if your site is slow

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,700
people are going to get angry if they're

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,080
like me at least don't give your users

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,770
that frustration so if you have a fast

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,320
site they're gonna love you also pwace

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:36,170
are engaging because your site is now an

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,140
app someone can actually download your

00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,840
site and have it installed on their home

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,730
page without the use of an app store it

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,470
offers a full screen experience if you

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,870
set it up that way you can actually have

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,510
push notifications go out to the user if

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,220
you set it up that way and it's gonna be

00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,900
so reliable and so fast that people

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,820
won't have problems engaging with it if

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,290
you have a good website and actual

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,100
quality content associated with it

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:03,710
though next Google is looking for

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,770
accessibility yes accessibility is

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,880
important as Steve mentioned today

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,190
lighthouse it's going to check some of

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,520
the basic things for you but also what's

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,559
nice is not accessibility a lot of it is

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,929
subjective and so they're going to give

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,030
you a list of things that you can check

00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:21,980
for manually afterwards and I highly

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:25,780
recommend going through all of those

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:28,640
when you run this test on your site now

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,870
I'm not an accessibility expert

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,510
but some of the things that I've found

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,660
are pretty important for accessibility

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,250
our color contrast if someone is color

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,049
blind are they able to see the

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,670
difference what is the difference

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:42,530
between your foreground color you have

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,360
and the background color is it even

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,690
readable for those people where people

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,970
who have more vision impairment do you

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,559
have well-structured HTML elements so if

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,700
they're using a screen reader it's

00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,220
actually going to understand the

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,830
hierarchy and be able to tell someone

00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,010
who's visiting your site what that

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:03,770
hierarchy is do you have correct

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,750
attributes on the elements so you're not

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,220
trying to trick the browser into

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,230
thinking things are what they aren't

00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,910
which in turn can trick someone who's

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:16,370
got an impairment and keyboard-only

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,870
usage do you have a logical tab order

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,370
set to your site when you're using the

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,809
keyboard only if you want to have a

00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,299
really fun experience

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:25,970
turn on your screen reader on your

00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,580
computer turn off your monitor and then

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,290
try to navigate through your own website

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,600
you know your website better than anyone

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,290
else and if you're not able to do it

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,880
then imagine someone who literally

00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,290
doesn't know your website how are they

00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,070
going to access it you need to be

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:45,919
thinking about people next Google looks

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:48,890
for best practices there's always going

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,320
to be best practices and sometimes these

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,990
practices are going to change but by

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,150
following some of the ones that Google

00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,200
wants then it's going to make your site

00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:02,120
better first one is HTTPS do you have an

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,130
SSL certificate installed on your site

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,960
that will prevent intruders from

00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,150
tampering with or listening to data

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,330
between your site and your visitors

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:15,110
giving you more trust

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:18,350
do you have HTTP to set up and this will

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,730
provide faster resource service and that

00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,549
also means that less data will be

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:27,320
required for your users

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:31,730
this requires having HTTPS on it though

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:35,260
so one is required for - do you ask for

00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:38,929
permission requests initially onload if

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:41,840
you have a site where you want to push

00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:44,059
out notifications don't ask someone

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,559
as soon as they enter your site do you

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:47,149
want to receive notifications from that

00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,809
Google doesn't like that people though

00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:52,669
don't like that if you have a map where

00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,919
your geo-locating something don't just

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:55,549
ask can I have your location as soon as

00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,200
they turn on site

00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:58,909
no wait until you have an actual

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,039
targeted event wait until they click on

00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:03,259
the find my location button before

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,129
asking them that that way you can

00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:08,779
provide them with a good user experience

00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:11,389
do you have any browser errors that are

00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,700
logged to console basically is your

00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:16,309
JavaScript working do you have anything

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,249
that might be broken on your site that

00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:21,700
the browser is seeing as broken the one

00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:24,169
is also if you have images that might be

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,749
for reporting so they're not showing you

00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:29,210
broken images and speaking of images

00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:33,409
does the image display match the aspect

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:35,629
ratio if you have an image that is 3 by

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:37,580
2 ratio and you're trying to squish it

00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,830
into a 1 by 1 square and it starts

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,479
distorting it people don't like that

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,929
Google doesn't like that either

00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:47,479
and obviously it was there any doubt

00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:50,149
this is Google so SEO is something that

00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:50,899
they're looking for three areas that

00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,659
they're looking for

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:56,960
first is your site mobile-friendly yes

00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:59,179
this is a mobile first talk but if your

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,059
site is mobile first obviously it's

00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,499
mobile-friendly - are you following

00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,539
content best practices

00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,559
do you have well-structured HTML do you

00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:09,770
have title tags

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,859
do you have descriptions or do you have

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:16,520
alt tags added or all attributes added

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:18,169
to your images do you have actual text

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,000
links you're not putting an image in

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,919
there so people and search engines

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,750
aren't able to see where this link is

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,270
going and last is your website crawl and

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:32,539
index friendly basically are you

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,859
returning valid HTTP status codes and do

00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:40,819
you have a robots.txt file that is

00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:43,309
opening search engines to your site so

00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:46,159
there are a lot of things that you have

00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:48,139
to pay attention to to score well on

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,859
Google's lighthouse and have a mobile

00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:54,619
first web site is it possible especially

00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:55,609
on a WordPress website and the answer is

00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,549
that yes it

00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:00,559
totally as possible and Jimmy's reaction

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:02,119
there was my reaction two weeks ago when

00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:07,239
I finally managed to make it work on a

00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:09,529
website and also I had a co-worker who

00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:12,140
literally texted me 10 minutes before

00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:13,700
this talk started showing me that the

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,589
progressive web app is now a badge

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,609
instead of this so this talks already

00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:22,489
outdated but I'm leading the development

00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:24,380
of a themed framework for media buying

00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:26,119
which is called trellis and we're gonna

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,489
be completely open sourcing it once

00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,009
we're done with it but we managed to

00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:34,430
finally score perfect 100's across the

00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:36,829
board this theme it includes a PWA right

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,319
out of the box which is kind of cool but

00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:42,799
we're making sure that it's ticking all

00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:45,079
those boxes and know this theme isn't

00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:48,559
done and these numbers are probably

00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,410
inflated because yes this test it had

00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,989
one image it had one plug-in active and

00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,489
if you look up at the top you can see

00:35:53,989 --> 00:35:59,690
that's the dot test domain so it was

00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:01,759
running on a local site meaning who

00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,489
knows so we decided ok let's just take

00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,829
this half-built theme and move it on to

00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:08,809
a popular WordPress host and we scored a

00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:11,180
99 in performance which is still really

00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:12,859
good this is just the theme as a

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,230
progressive web app which shows how cool

00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:17,869
is if you can have a progressive web app

00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,960
for your website because it really bumps

00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,700
up that performance score that you have

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:28,160
this also does not have caching enabled

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:31,339
so this is just running as is one thing

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,519
bugs me though that 90 and the SEO we're

00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:36,170
not it's not open to the public yet so

00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,759
the robot dot text is turned off

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,009
meaning I'm always gonna have to look at

00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:43,670
that 90 if I run it on an extra site I

00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:47,710
just have to deal with it but once again

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:51,619
why is it important to go mobile first

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,599
selfishly because Google likes it I mean

00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:57,009
your site's gonna rank higher which

00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,319
means you're gonna have more people

00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:03,739
visiting your site because it's faster

00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,529
it's nicer and obviously that depends on

00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:08,119
if you have quality content or not

00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:09,790
Google's lighthouse it can guide your

00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,280
site to being mobile

00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:15,410
unselfishly however it's for people as

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,020
we saw all those changes that had

00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,450
happened over the years of search

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,829
industry they happen because they wanted

00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,020
to provide better experience for people

00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:26,359
that's what our underlying factor should

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,010
be more people are using mobile phones

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:31,040
we need to give them an optimal

00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,490
experience the web is open to all as it

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,500
should be

00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,230
we need to do our part to make sure that

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,119
it stays open to everyone I'm selling

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,829
I'm a senior software engineer at media

00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,160
vine you can find me online at selling

00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:50,920
calm or on Twitter at Seth Allen we have

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:50,920
time for questions any questions yeah

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:12,220
so the question is what themes for

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:15,850
mobile first and any tools for

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,770
developing right now I don't know of any

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,870
themes that are out there for mobile

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,610
first I've always just built my own so

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:24,490
that's probably the best answer I can

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,200
give at the time we don't I don't know

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,690
there might be more maybe someone can

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,530
answer that later we can talk later

00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:34,780
and then for developing I'd say the main

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:38,110
thing is and it was hard for me at first

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,030
to get my head around it was actually

00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,850
thinking in a mobile environment and

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,950
when making media queries actually

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,320
realizing that I am NOT trying to go

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,090
down I'm trying to go up which it

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,640
doesn't seem like it's that hard of a

00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,170
contact switch but whenever I do it I

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,550
still cuz I've only been doing for about

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:58,060
a year where I finally made the switch

00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,860
to mobile first it's just thinking about

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:04,510
it all the time making sure that you're

00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:07,920
really focused on the mobile user is

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,920
your question yes

00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:18,140
so question was progressive web app or

00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,390
native app and really it depends on what

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,800
it is that you're going for a native app

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,440
you'll probably still be able to do a

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,089
lot more than with a progressive web app

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,650
the nice thing about a progressive web

00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:33,680
app is it's your own website and it's

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,290
going to do better for that general

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,800
search traffic but if you need specific

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:41,720
app technology then definitely want to

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,700
go with a native app progressive web app

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,410
is just in the sense that your website

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,140
now can become like an app any other

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,370
questions

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:59,080
all right thank you

00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:59,080
