Description: 
	In 1786 Benjamin Franklin said there are two certainties in life: Death and Taxes. Another certainty can be added: Change. It is important for you to understand what impact the change in the tax law will have on your WordPress business. We will build your tax knowledge by exploring ways that you can take advantage of all the allowable IRS personal and business deductions. We will look at the new tax rates and brackets, explain the Section 199A Qualified Business Income, and address different business structures. Youâ€™ll learn that taxes are fun, not boring.
