Title: Chuck Lovelace: Death, Taxes, and Change
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	In 1786 Benjamin Franklin said there are two certainties in life: Death and Taxes. Another certainty can be added: Change. It is important for you to understand what impact the change in the tax law will have on your WordPress business. We will build your tax knowledge by exploring ways that you can take advantage of all the allowable IRS personal and business deductions. We will look at the new tax rates and brackets, explain the Section 199A Qualified Business Income, and address different business structures. Youâ€™ll learn that taxes are fun, not boring.

alright we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,280
glad you're right here on the very front

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,570
row I'll probably point at you about 50

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,300
times today good let me give you just a

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,760
quick little story you know I I gotta

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,880
tell you that I've only been involved in

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,560
the WordPress community for a few months

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,180
and I'm an older guy I'm looking around

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,739
probably one of the older guys in the

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,920
room and so my background I used to come

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:43,629
through date and before I 75 was built

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,190
so that tells you kind of how old I am

00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:49,040
but you know I used to tell everybody

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,790
because when I was in college we didn't

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,379
have computers so I couldn't learn code

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,600
and do all that because we didn't have

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:01,040
any computers to do that so I'd always

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:05,000
say to people we didn't have computers

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,270
when I was in college well in 2003 I

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,850
became a grandfather and my grandson

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,530
smart little guy came up a little bit

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,650
and in 2011 I had my fourth grandchild

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,350
and my granddaughter when she was two

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:25,370
years old was sitting on the floor

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:30,800
playing with the iPad and my grandson

00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:33,890
who at that time was eight leaned over

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,700
to my wife and said you know what

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:41,060
grandma when I was her age we didn't

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,710
have iPads so I thought no no that's

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,630
pretty interesting so that's kind of the

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,600
way I was so I got involved with the

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,120
WordPress community and I got the

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,550
meeting people that were all business

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,590
people they were doing WordPress for

00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,740
various and sundry reasons they were

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,990
doing coding they were doing it

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,180
independently and so I thought you know

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,190
with my background there may be

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,960
something that I have to offer to this

00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,629
community because I certainly can't

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,140
offer coding advice I can't offer any

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,990
computer advice but I can offer some tax

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,530
advice so my background is in the tax

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,410
industry I've been around for a while

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,470
so I just wanted to share some things so

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:28,720
that you all it may be helpful to you

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,280
but Benjamin Franklin said it in in the

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,620
1700s there's only two certainties in

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,140
life death in taxes and then Denis

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,610
Waitley came along in the middle 80s and

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,970
he said you know there's another

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,230
certainty in life and that is change so

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,060
when you put taxes and change together

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,810
there's a there's a lot of stuff going

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,600
on so we're not gonna talk about death

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,420
today we're gonna talk about taxes and

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,460
change and changes in the tax law and

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,650
how you can take advantage of them

00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:10,240
either as an individual or as a business

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:13,820
is anybody apprehensive about the IRS

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,310
everybody nervous about the IRS you know

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,000
you hear all these stories about the IRS

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,280
and how you know kind of they'll come

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,239
and do all kinds of things to you but

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,150
the IRS was established or founded in

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,910
1862 and then in 1953 the name was

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,959
changed to the IRS an Internal Revenue

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:39,470
Service and they are responsible for

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,660
collecting the taxes okay

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,330
now they're they don't they don't do the

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:49,160
tax code they are responsible for

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:52,700
upholding and enforcing the tax code now

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,250
the tax code is created by Congress so

00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:01,459
the Internal Revenue Code is created by

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:05,330
Congress and it is seventy four thousand

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,340
pages long so when you do your income

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,600
tax return whether it's for your

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,970
business whether it's for your personal

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,450
all of the laws and all of the rules for

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:21,530
seventy four thousand pages become a

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:27,080
part of that well last year in December

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:31,850
we had the tax cut and Jobs Act and it

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:36,260
was signed on December 22nd 1973

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:39,830
nineteen 2017 Jojo old I am still

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,740
thinking the 1900s but he was signed

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,960
into law on that and it was the biggest

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,240
overhaul in a generation

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,450
they haven't had as many sweeping

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,660
changes in the tax law in 30 years so

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,490
this was a big deal and it's impacted

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,890
everybody and I'm sure you've read about

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,440
it you've heard about it in the news

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,660
you've heard about it

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,420
online every day there seems to be some

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,980
kind of a story and now we're right in

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,920
the middle of tax season how many of you

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,840
done your taxes this year a few of you

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,110
did you get more back or less back a

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,760
little less what about y'all more or

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,810
less back the the papers say that early

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,530
on in the season

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,060
people are getting less back and but now

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,530
they say they're getting more back so it

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,500
one thing that we'll say and when we get

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,810
into Q&A the answer is well it all

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,010
depends it depends on your situation it

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:43,970
depends on where you are so the the IRS

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:47,360
was responsible for taking the laws and

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,240
in a short amount of time putting them

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,330
into documents so that they could be

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,700
executed this year so in the witan with

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,380
the government shutdown we're we're a

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,000
little bit behind or they're a little

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,390
bit behind so here we are it's time for

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,360
us to do our taxes and this is a cute

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:16,270
little little joke here so when you are

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,160
a wordpress community and you work on

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,140
programming or if you do websites for

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,290
people one thing that you have to

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:29,060
determine is whether you are a business

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:31,670
or a hobby you know a lot of people they

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,030
get involved with programming they get

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:38,330
involved in doing websites for people

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:41,210
and they do one here and one there and

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:45,350
they don't do it on a regular basis and

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,480
they might not claim any did

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,120
actions for any of that so you know they

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,350
might be doing it for a hobby well on

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,140
this new tax law a lot of changes happen

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,740
and a couple of them were this you can

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:04,400
no longer claim deductions for business

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,500
losses on your schedule a used to you

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,530
could claim that so anybody that

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,800
itemizes deductions this year cannot

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:17,930
claim any kind of business at all in

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:22,550
addition you cannot claim any expenses

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:26,390
for a hobby you could before but in the

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,220
in the tax cut and Jobs Act they cut out

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,230
all expenses for a hobby and I'll give

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:34,700
you an example of that if somebody were

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:37,370
a painter and they painted in not houses

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,920
but they painted pictures and they sold

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,900
the pictures and they made three

00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,010
thousand dollars for selling their

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:50,120
paintings you to people around the

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,730
country and it costs them a thousand

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,790
dollars to pay for the paints and to

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:59,330
travel to you know fairs and that kind

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:03,620
of thing they have to claim three

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:06,110
thousand dollars in income and zero

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,470
expenses so if you're in that situation

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,830
that you're doing WordPress and and you

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:18,640
have you know some expenses and you're

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:21,230
doing some work you need to then decide

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,860
do I want this to be my business so I

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:27,560
can lower my taxable income or do I want

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,050
it to remain a hobby and if you want it

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,669
to be a business you have to make noise

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:37,940
and what that means is you have to you

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,550
have to have records you set up a

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,650
separate bank account so that you can

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:47,330
have you know all of your income

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,210
separate you write your checks out of a

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,530
separate bank account and you can then

00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,890
start continuing education a trip like

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,760
this

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,390
is continuing education getting

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,180
you you know more knowledgeable about

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,760
what you're about as far as your

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,350
business is concerned so you have to

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,610
make that determination

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,100
and if you want to take advantage of the

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,900
tax laws and take advantage of the

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,930
allowable deductions which we're going

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,510
to talk about the minute then you need

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,850
to make the noise and you can set it up

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,090
as a business so in setting it up as a

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:31,120
business we need to understand the

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,040
business structure okay and so whenever

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,620
I talk to you I want to talk to what the

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:41,350
majority of you may be involved with and

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,390
and that is a sole proprietorship so a

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:49,360
sole proprietorship sole means one and

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,060
so you have to be the only person

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,090
involved in the business as far as the

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,120
management of the business now a husband

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,970
and a wife work together and they do

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,100
things together in the business then

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,890
it's not a sole proprietorship if the

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,990
husband makes decisions for the wife or

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,540
the wife makes decisions for the husband

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,440
it's not a sole proprietorship it is a

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,170
partnership then and there are sets

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,770
different tax laws and tax rules so most

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,660
of you that do work in that do

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,660
programming and don't work for a company

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:30,100
you're a sole proprietor now you can

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:34,660
work for a company and still work on the

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,230
side and still be a sole proprietor sole

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:42,690
proprietor is not really a legal entity

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:48,100
okay so if I go out and sell Mary Kay

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm not very good at that by the way if

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,270
I go out and sell Mary Kay and they pay

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,760
me because I collect money and I and I

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,070
turned the money in and I get expenses

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,060
then I'm a sole proprietor and I'm not a

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:08,020
legal entity then I take the income and

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,090
and put it on a Schedule C of my tax

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,780
return okay in

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:15,070
expenses is a Schedule C so it's just

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,880
what I do

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:25,000
okay a partnership would do the same

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,580
thing but if I sold Mary Kay and I did

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,550
something so that somebody was hurt or

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,650
injured by the product that I sold as a

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,240
sole proprietor

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:42,940
if I were sued then they could come

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:45,790
after me my house my car my furniture

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,970
and I would be in big trouble

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:52,540
as a sole proprietor but there's another

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:56,020
entity called a limited liability

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,320
corporation that you can be a sole

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,290
proprietor and establish a limited

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:06,880
liability corporation you can do that as

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:10,240
a sole proprietor you can do that as a

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,120
partnership and and so when it says

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,570
limited liability I want to kind of

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,410
clarify for you that it's not full

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:23,170
liability because if you have to use

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,390
your personal assets to start the

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:31,210
business then they could attach a

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:34,870
illegaly gala tea to your personal

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:37,510
assets so you have to get this set up

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,610
properly and hopefully get your business

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,950
going so that you can start getting

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,050
loans in the name of the business and

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,990
and it would probably and it could still

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,660
have your name attached to it it could

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:55,750
be towards your name Shannon it could be

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,630
Shannon's programming company LLC but

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:02,550
the LLC is the liability the limited

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:06,180
liability that Shannon has in order to

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:11,460
protect herself in that company but

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:16,480
here's the interesting part an LLC is

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:20,110
what they call a pass-through entity so

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,890
if you're a sole proprietor I'm selling

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,920
Mary Kay

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm not an LLC I fill out a Schedule C

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,420
on my tax return and and I just do do my

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:38,310
tax return and I can lower my liability

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:44,470
as a limited liability company LLC the

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:49,240
taxes do not go to Shannon's LLC they go

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,970
on to Shannon's personal tax return so

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,550
it's a pass through it there's a

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,230
pass-through for partnerships it passes

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,139
through the partnership if you make a

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,820
thousand dollar profit and you have two

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:06,250
partners what one partner gets the $500

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,070
income and the other partner gets a $500

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,290
income if you have five partners it's

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,420
equally divided or it's divided

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,750
according to the percentage of

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,440
partnership that you might own in the

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,329
business so it passes right through to

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,480
your personal now if you're a

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,339
corporation then you have it that's a

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,990
separate entity it's a separate legal

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:35,050
entity so you could be Shannon's

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:38,310
software company Inc you could be

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:44,829
incorporated then the corporation pays

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:47,740
taxes and you don't unless the

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:50,110
corporation pays you and then you pay

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,410
taxes only on the amount that you're

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:57,060
paid by the corporation corporation is

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,320
taxed and sometimes you know people they

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,640
don't want to get into a corporation

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,220
because they feel like they're being

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,260
taxed twice and that could happen

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,560
because your corporation gets taxed and

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:13,149
then you get taxed but the taxes are a

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,329
lot lower okay then the the the other

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:18,760
pass-through part is well it's not pass

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:24,540
through but the other kind of catch is

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:28,980
you can be a sole proprietor LLC and

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:33,360
select to be taxed as a corporation so

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,280
that then you can pay yourself a salary

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,010
so if you're an LLC

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,710
and you're a sole proprietor you can't

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:45,040
pay yourself a salary you can have a

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:48,010
owners draw so you can take money out of

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,830
the corporation but at the end of the

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:54,690
year when you do your Schedule C and you

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:57,070
do your income tax return the profit is

00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,280
taxable and you have to pay

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:04,450
self-employment tax on that so you pay

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,960
tax on the on the on the profit of that

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,880
business - all your deductions so

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,830
there's a there's an opportunity there

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,680
and my company is an example I'm an LLC

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:20,380
but I selected to be a corporation

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,160
because I have different entities and so

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:28,750
I have to pay a file of what they call

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:32,310
an eleven twenty tanks return and the

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:36,060
corporation is taxed and if I pay myself

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:39,850
then I have to either pay

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,760
self-employment tax or I pay myself as a

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,060
w-2 employee I can do that as a

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,610
corporation but I can't as a partnership

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,070
or sole proprietorship if I'm if I'm one

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,310
of the owners I have to get a k1 or

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:58,630
something like that so anyway so there's

00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:02,260
all of these are interesting ways that

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:05,380
it's part of that forty seven or seventy

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,290
four thousand page document that all of

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,860
this is is marked up in and then you

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,209
have an S corporation where you can be

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:20,800
have partners be taxed as a pass-through

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:23,530
you divide up the the the profits again

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,620
and that passes through to your personal

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,950
income tax so but you file a different

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:32,020
tax return you know you file an eleven

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,410
20s and it's sometimes called a sub

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,470
subchapter S corporation so that's

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:42,550
that's kind of the business structure

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:46,060
now when you have a business the the IRS

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,130
allows you deductions

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,270
and they have to be necessary and

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,730
ordinary

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:57,670
okay so what that means is if you have a

00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:01,570
deduction that is necessary for your

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,360
business then you can claim it but if

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,610
it's ordinary than something that you

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,340
you know is common to the business I

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,920
mean if you have a business and you have

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,550
to give people documents and print them

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,540
out then the paper that you buy is

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:20,800
that's necessary okay and to be

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,000
necessary it doesn't have to be

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:27,670
by golly this is it but it can be you

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,810
know things that you you need like I

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:36,340
need a clicker if I'm gonna click on a

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:40,990
slide show okay so I'm clicking and I

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:44,560
buy this clicker it's necessary but it's

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,860
not mandatory necessary so there are

00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,400
things that you can claim that you that

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,980
are necessary but this isn't necessary

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,110
ordinary if I don't do presentations or

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,270
if people that are in my line of work

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:03,270
don't do presentation so that's just so

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:07,660
that's excuse me a small example of that

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:13,270
ordinary is things like coming to a

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:15,220
conference or mileage so what I want to

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:19,120
do is just tell you about some of these

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:25,600
deductions there that are most common

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:29,560
there are over 100 deductions that are

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,260
allowable to you and a lot of you may

00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,970
claim every single one of them but there

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,000
there are a hundred deductions but the

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:41,110
ones that are most common are right here

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,480
on this on this slide and I've

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:48,370
highlighted the yellow because I wanted

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:51,570
to speak to them and just address them

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,490
for just a moment education and training

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:58,190
so if you're if you're coming here as a

00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:03,620
hobby and you drove here from

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:08,930
Michigan and it was 200 miles and that

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:12,770
this is your hobby and you pay $40 to

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:18,170
get here and and you went out to dinner

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:25,060
last night and you had a nice glass of

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:30,590
wine and you had a you know a $52 steak

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:34,940
if this is your hobby forget it you

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:40,340
can't claim any of it at all but if this

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:43,690
is your business then you can claim 58

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:48,260
cents a mile to drive here the 200 miles

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,480
you can claim your meal but the rules

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,860
for meals are a little bit different you

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,980
can only claim 50 percent of your meal

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,200
okay so you got a little math to do when

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,480
you do your income tax return you can

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:10,190
claim your hotel room and you can claim

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,470
the $40 that you paid to come in here so

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,250
that's a that's all a tax deduction so

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:18,710
if this year you made or if you got some

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,410
business while you were here and you you

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,390
made $400 but your mileage and

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,540
everything added up for 300 then you

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,080
only made a hundred bucks according to

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,320
the IRS and the law okay

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,690
equipment you all work in computers just

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,980
about everybody here has a computer in

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:43,160
front of them and you can claim the

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,590
computer now in the past you had to

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,250
depreciate the computer and you could

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:52,910
only claim support but each year but

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:56,930
with the new tax law and the deduction

00:21:52,910 --> 00:22:00,080
that's called section 179 I think is the

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,420
is the number on it you can claim the

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,330
entire computer and you don't even have

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,790
to list it on as inventory you know you

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,260
might want to in case you sell your

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,040
company but

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:17,220
you can claim the whole entire computer

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,960
effective on the this 22nd of December

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,050
last year so if you bought a computer

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,260
last year to claim the whole thing so

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:29,460
the equipment and interestingly enough

00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:48,750
you can claim if you want to buy a car

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:50,910
for your business 100% now yes that's a

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:55,220
great question and I'll get to that in

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:58,320
another fly I've got you covered okay

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,180
meals we already talked about meals that

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,000
you can claim 50 percent but here's the

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:10,680
interesting thing about meals meals you

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,010
eat all the time in the rule that's

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,660
allowable is you have to talk about

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:25,590
business before the meal or during the

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:28,710
meal or after the meal okay so I go to

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:34,620
chick-fil-a and I take my wife with me

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:37,140
and we talk about business I claim that

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,780
deduction because we talk about business

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,220
or we may be sitting talking about

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,340
business because she's part of my

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,960
company we may be talking about business

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,270
and then say hey let's go get something

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,420
to eat we go get something to eat

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:54,270
immediately and we can claim that meal

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,270
we can only claim 50% of it but guess

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,030
what if she eats a meal and I eat a meal

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,960
we get to claim one of them and that's

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,960
good news

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,960
okay at the end of the year those add up

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:16,580
yes she's a seat yeah you can

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:23,530
but she's she's an employee she's a

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,530
partner in my business right right right

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,570
she's not claimed because she's my

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,940
spouse but I talk about business with

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:39,050
everybody and everybody is a potential

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:45,040
client everybody I talked to even all of

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,040
you are potential clients yes

00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:01,310
well typically you has anybody ever

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:04,310
watched the Mad Men yeah anyway if you

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,780
didn't you need to go google it and then

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,490
watch it on Netflix or something's a

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,230
great show but you know they're always

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,240
going out and eating and talking about

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,780
business but it needs to be relatively

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,990
you know soon yeah you can't go eat

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,880
lunch and then about 8:00 tonight say

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,550
yeah let's talk business

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,630
but I it needs to be a reasonable and

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:28,640
typically it's during the meal okay

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:31,520
before after you can grab a meal like

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,840
we've done here we just grabbed a meal

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,180
downstairs and went up to a to a cup of

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,060
podcasts a live podcast now if we were

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:45,280
paying for that meal and went up then if

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,280
it's immediately after yes

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,340
yeah

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:58,370
your your did you say in the hotel okay

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,340
yeah that's a your you're on a business

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:04,100
trip so you can claim that whole that

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,230
whole thing well you fifty percent but

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,550
you you keep your receipt

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,550
keep same fifty percent

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,260
just like her you're way ahead of me

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,179
I'll get to that I'll answer that

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,940
question in just a minute you guys are

00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:30,830
awesome you're way ahead of me travel

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,220
that's what I really wanna talk about

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:37,820
too so if you if I send you a check

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,820
because you did it my website I send you

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,450
a check and you take that check and

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,299
deposit it in the bank the bank is five

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,669
miles from your house

00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:52,669
that's five miles to the bank and five

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:56,030
miles back you can claim fifty eight

00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,720
cents a mile because that's a part of

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,130
your business operation that's ordinary

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,559
part of business you have to deposit

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,470
that check well no you don't since it's

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:09,380
coming for me but you need to deposit

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,960
that check okay so that's part of the

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,020
ordinary business expense so the mileage

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,590
that can add up if you go to a business

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,030
lunch and you did but it depends on kind

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,929
of where you live and where your

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:26,150
business is you can't claim if you work

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:28,850
for someone you can't claim going to and

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,299
from work okay you can't claim that kind

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,460
of thing and so they've got rules and

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:37,970
it's allowable you just have to play

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:41,990
within the rules okay and then the last

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,500
is wages how many have kids that are

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:49,159
teenage eight nine ten years old okay if

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,570
you have a child that and you have a

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:56,990
company and your child if you put them

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:59,240
to work and pay them that has to be

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,159
legitimate you can't be a three-year-old

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,440
and you're paying them because you need

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:09,590
the deduction but if they're ten and

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,669
they can make copies they can scan they

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,640
can they can do whatever assignment that

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:22,659
you can give them you can pay them and

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:25,730
you don't have to pay Medicare and and

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:28,370
Social Security on them so you don't

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:31,490
have to deduct it claim it on your

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,029
schedule see is wages and you and that

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,679
brings

00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:38,629
your taxable income down and what I like

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,149
to do is see how much I'm supposed to

00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:43,909
pay you know what deductions in there

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:48,379
and then see how much I pay and then

00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:51,769
it's like yes but but unfortunately all

00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:56,719
my kids are over 18 unfortunately all my

00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:59,059
kids are over 40 but but you can and

00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:01,669
they can only be 18 okay

00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:09,099
you can't claim them after 18 so they

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:17,989
got a beat in those teenagers a child

00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:20,479
okay no child child your child you can't

00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:24,049
do your knees you can't do my grant hey

00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:27,589
trust me I got four grandkids if I could

00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:31,089
go beyond my children sure I wouldn't be

00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:31,089
paying any taxes

00:29:39,409 --> 00:30:03,480
it's got to be reasonable you can't give

00:29:42,029 --> 00:30:06,510
them $100,000 a year right yeah what the

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,929
child does with it is no concern of the

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:13,019
IRS what you do with it in on behalf of

00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:17,490
the child is no concern of the IRS okay

00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:21,570
so you can put it in a accrues account

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,820
and go on a cruise and pay for the

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:34,590
child's cruise out of that if they got

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:36,899
to make you know more than $50 okay so

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,240
it's a sole proprietorship or

00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:42,899
partnership C Corp different rules

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,720
different you know you could pay 1099

00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:48,630
you could pay them the 1099 but if they

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:53,809
were your child or you could actually

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:53,809
pay somebody say you had a kid that

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,460
mowed the lawn or something that and it

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:01,080
was a legitimate it's got to be

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,659
legitimate you can't just start making

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,320
stuff up but it's got to be a legitimate

00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,659
task then and they made over $600 then

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,940
you'd have to give them a 1099 they made

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,919
under $600 you wouldn't you could still

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:21,779
pay them and it's an expense

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:25,220
oh you're C Corp okay all right so this

00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,690
is one that you all are going to be

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,960
thinking about because if you're all in

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:33,510
business for yourself this allowable

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,279
home deduction so let me just say this

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,960
about the IRS I'm going to talk to you

00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,690
about a tax cap in just a minute

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,520
but

00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,770
a lot of people want to claim their

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,400
office and that's an allowable deduction

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,980
if you do work from home however when

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,870
you start looking at the number of tax

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,510
returns that were done last year 150

00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,220
million tax returns were done and you

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,410
start looking at audits and you all said

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,240
yeah I'm scared of the IRS the

00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:08,210
percentage of audits to individuals and

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:12,140
companies or individuals is very very

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:16,550
very very low and I believe that with

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,140
the the government shutdown the IRS said

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,210
they were a year behind I'm not sure how

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,430
they got a year behind only being shut

00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:28,760
down a couple weeks but that's what they

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:32,180
said so the chances are slim for me as

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:38,240
an individual to get audited if you know

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:42,170
I got things in place okay see corpse it

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,910
raises the Nazi clerks but a sole

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:50,780
proprietor a Schedule C on your tax

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:55,250
return it kind of raises that

00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:59,960
opportunity for an audit if you claim

00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:03,650
your home as a deduction it puts a flag

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,650
a red flag or a yellow flag it depends

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,720
on the how much you claim but that

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:14,260
higher it raises your you know the

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,680
opportunity for you to get an audit so

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:21,530
they're pretty you know pretty snotty

00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,480
knows about this home deduction and and

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,880
so it's written up there what they'll

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,220
what they're looking at is it's got to

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,020
be your principal place of business okay

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,450
and yeah it's got to be on a regular

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:35,780
basis so you can't just say oh yeah I

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:38,180
did one website and so I'm gonna

00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,280
disclaim my home as a deduction so but

00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,310
when you claim your home you have to

00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:46,370
claim the square footage of the space

00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,230
and you can claim mortgage you can claim

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,580
the electric so you can get your

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,470
deduction you know up there pretty good

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:58,870
however

00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:03,460
it has to be used exclusively for that

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:05,620
business so that means and the IRS will

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,770
ask did you check your email your

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,800
personal email in your office now if you

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:14,470
go off to an office somewhere and work

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,290
for the man you can check your email all

00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,940
day long you can take your child to the

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,760
office with you if your boss will let

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,349
you and it's no big deal

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,879
but you can't do it in your home office

00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:30,790
you're not supposed to check your email

00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,790
now people do it but if if the IRS

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:38,200
audits you and ask you that question and

00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:40,960
you say yes disallowed can't take the

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,419
deduction I heard a story of a IRS guy

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,099
coming in to somebody their home office

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:50,139
was right there they had all their stuff

00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:54,849
and the IRS guy came in and said what's

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:55,270
a what's the baby cradle crib doing in

00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:59,140
here

00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:02,410
and she says oh watch my little girl you

00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:06,880
know while I'm working this allowed not

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:10,569
exclusive so they really like I say that

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,940
that raises a red flag but there's an

00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:16,930
opportunity then for you to take a more

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:21,880
simple option so you can take five

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:24,550
dollars per square foot maximum of three

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,319
hundred square feet so you have to take

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:30,819
you know the amount of space that you

00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:33,339
have and and then you can but it's a

00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,400
maximum of a fifteen hundred dollar

00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:38,619
deduction so if you need a deduction

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,130
that's the best way to go it unless you

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:44,859
or by golly sure that you're not going

00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:48,160
to have to worry about that audit and

00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:51,720
worry about the you know the penalties

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,720
for that okay

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:58,270
so here's one of the IRS they you know

00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:02,060
they're tasked with with actually

00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:03,890
keeping these they're tasked with

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,740
raising money they're tasked with

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,900
collecting the money and this is why

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,110
they sometimes get so snotty-nosed there

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:16,310
is a tax gap and the tax gap is the

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:20,960
amount between what people say their

00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:25,280
income is so I'm a server at a

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,220
restaurant and I made like $700 in pips

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,850
and I do my tax return but I only claim

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:36,800
300 so the amount that you're supposed

00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:40,940
to claim versus the amount that you

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,760
claim so there's a four hundred fifty

00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,480
four billion dollar gap and it's the IRS

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,280
a job to try to close that gap now one

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,220
hundred twenty two billion of that is

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,810
from Schedule C companies that's why

00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,550
they take a close look at that because

00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:01,160
the opportunity for them to get more

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:05,359
money back in fines and penalties is

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:11,660
greater okay so and then a lot of people

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:14,810
don't need viola taxes oh go figure so

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:19,850
here's the answer to your question you

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:24,609
have to keep good records okay you have

00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:28,460
to have documents you have to have

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:33,350
backup for everything that you claim now

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:37,670
I've had clients come in with a box full

00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:39,080
of receipts and it's like so you say

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,990
well if you want to go over there and

00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,270
separate those receipts then we'll talk

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,580
or you can pay me a hundred dollars an

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,320
hour and I'm happy to separate them you

00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,150
know well how long is that going to take

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,960
you know about two thousand dollars

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,820
worth so they save two thousand dollars

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,980
by separating the receipts after they

00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,590
bring them in but the reality is they

00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,560
should do it beforehand

00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,990
so you came to Dayton

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,960
you keep a mileage log of your miles and

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,210
then you keep a receipt you make

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,280
yourself out an expense report you have

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:18,830
a good record of that you stapled your

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:21,410
meal receipt to your hotel bill and then

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:25,910
keep it in a file say this is my trip to

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:28,550
Dayton to word camp for the education /

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:50,710
training expense and I'm taking on my

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:50,710
tax return right right

00:38:54,779 --> 00:39:03,279
right if that word is a regular course

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,109
of business or a marketing function you

00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:06,989
just have to document it that way and

00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:09,759
say this is part of my advertising

00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:12,460
campaign to do whatever it is or

00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:15,009
whatever the reason is so that you can

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,819
have some kind of substantiation of that

00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:22,029
okay and in in that's a tough one

00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:24,220
because then the I that's up to that's

00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:27,249
one of those it depends answers because

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,319
it depends on who you get to audit you

00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:32,140
if you were to get audited if you don't

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:35,079
get audit it's no big deal you know but

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,269
you have to be ready that you're one of

00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,089
that smaller percentage of people that

00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:42,190
get audited okay so you have to have

00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:53,200
canceled checks you have to have

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:57,789
receipts yes correct but the IRS guy may

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,140
say prove it okay so anyway but you

00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:01,299
would that's that's one of those things

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:04,150
that you if that's what you do and you

00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:06,279
can take pictures of giving them out or

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,499
halves you know some kind of a record

00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:11,170
okay we're running out of time so

00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:13,299
anyways here to think record-keeping is

00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:18,460
critical you got to keep good records

00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:20,739
and I keep records of Records okay I got

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,450
records of everything I got you know I

00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:24,940
go on a trip I come back with a

00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,890
pocketful of receipts I fill out an

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,630
expense report every month it says

00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,910
here's where I went here's what I did

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:35,079
here's the mileage you used to have to

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,599
keep the the the mileage you UCF say

00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,519
nine hundred forty two thousand miles to

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,160
nine hundred forty seven thousand miles

00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:45,299
and subtract but now with all these apps

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,489
and and all that stuff you can just

00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:51,339
calculate but you have to keep a good

00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:54,069
record of that so and keep track of

00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:56,380
those any expenses you deduct and good

00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:58,960
record-keeping also then helps you when

00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,519
you do your tax return okay instead of

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,950
bringing in a box of receipts you bring

00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:06,569
in a nice little folder with everything

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:11,230
keep you cute and then the tax guy love

00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:14,049
here's another deduction that you get

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:17,170
this year it's called the qualified

00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:19,210
business income brand-spanking-new and

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,779
they've got a lot of rules attached to

00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:27,700
it but in a nutshell if you make a

00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:29,920
thousand dollars on a qualified income

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,529
for your business you can take twenty

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,279
percent right off the top right off your

00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:40,420
taxable in income so it's a qualified

00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:42,759
business income you have to make under

00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,950
then I'm sure most of you make over

00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:46,660
three hundred fifteen thousand so maybe

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,150
you can't claim it but you got to make

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,059
under three hundred fifteen thousand

00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:55,299
joint and under one hundred fifty seven

00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:59,170
thousand whether you're file joint or

00:41:55,299 --> 00:42:03,999
whether you file as a sole proprietor or

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:08,109
not file is a varied filing separately

00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:11,920
or as a single filer these are the tax

00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:13,749
rate changes there's four different

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,489
kinds of categories that you're gonna

00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:17,559
fall in you're gonna fall in as a single

00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:20,619
you're gonna file a fall in a marriage

00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:23,349
filing jointly you're gonna fall into a

00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:26,140
married filing separately or a head of

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:31,420
household so your head of household you

00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:34,569
have to be single or separated or

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:38,109
divorced and you have to have a

00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:40,359
dependent okay so you get a little

00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:44,499
higher deduction for that these are for

00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:46,269
last year 2019 is going to change so

00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:49,739
these are kind of you can look here real

00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:52,029
quick and see what your tax bracket is

00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:56,739
married filing jointly is a little bit

00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:58,480
different married filing separately is a

00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:03,900
little bit different and then head of

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,900
household is higher and so anyway I

00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:11,410
started this presentation telling you

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:14,499
that I was not a computer guy remember

00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,420
that part so let me just say this to you

00:43:14,499 --> 00:43:20,540
I'm happy to send you

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:24,280
these slides but I got to email them to

00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,820
you because I don't know how to do it on

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,150
anything

00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,970
I actually have a I actually have a

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:34,670
Twitter account and the only thing I

00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:38,030
know about Twitter and this is a segue

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,620
to your next guy is I get these

00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:45,820
notifications in my email and it says

00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:48,260
Nathan Ingram has posted on Twitter I

00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:53,060
get them all the time almost every

00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:55,550
single day and I go delete so I'm gonna

00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,740
well but so president Trump is on there

00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,050
too it's you and president Trump whoever

00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,680
is on Twitter gives me these

00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:06,440
notifications but Nathan's always the

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,900
you're always the top one Nathan always

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,360
a top one so anyway just take a picture

00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,010
of that send me an email and if you have

00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,790
any questions along the way feel free to

00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:21,590
email me and or you can send me a

00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:24,320
Twitter post I'll never respond but you

00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:28,490
can still send me one okay any last

00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:30,640
questions for our time is up yes a short

00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,640
one

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:44,400
you you might slide by and let me give

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:47,430
you two examples of that one I'm gonna

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,180
use you again he goes to the hotel okay

00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:54,420
and he and he goes to he gets room

00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,910
service and then he gets a massage and

00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:02,720
he gets you know but his total bill for

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:06,330
the hotel for the stay is 113 dollars or

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,960
$150 depends don't worry stay but the

00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:12,480
bill is three hundred forty two dollars

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,800
so he just turns in the receipt for the

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,869
hotel well if he were to get audited and

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,580
claim that three hundred and forty the

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:22,140
IRS is gonna want to break down here

00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,730
they were going to want a receipt for

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,160
the room service so they're gonna want

00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,230
some kind of tracking of that because it

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,580
comes out of different categories you're

00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:35,940
gonna pay for lodging you're gonna pay

00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:38,040
$150 for the meal you're gonna pay $65

00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,530
which you can only claim half so they're

00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,510
gonna want to break down rather than the

00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:47,130
whole thing you got a credit card

00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:50,700
account and you go to Walmart well they

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:53,820
want to know what at Walmart you bought

00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:59,820
did you buy notebooks or did you buy

00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:03,630
candy or did you buy you know water well

00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:06,390
you can use the water in your business

00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:09,210
so you could claim the water I claimed

00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:11,640
coffee I drink coffee all the time so if

00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:15,150
I get coffee you know things are caught

00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:17,460
I'll claim the coffee okay but then I'll

00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:23,310
get one thing of coffee that for me

00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:25,320
because it's mine right so but there you

00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:27,000
gotta you got to kind of separate them

00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,290
out because and that record-keeping is

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,270
important I always say this you know

00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:37,680
there's a lot of people and there's a

00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:40,080
lot of gray area and you got to let your

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,820
conscience be your guide and you know do

00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,940
what's right and that's why they call

00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,490
them allowable deductions the IRS

00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,200
doesn't care if you claim meals they

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,740
don't care if you claim coffee they

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,319
don't care if you claim mileage

00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:57,900
they just want it to be right and they

00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,490
want you to do it right and if you don't

00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,890
they're gonna penalize you they're gonna

00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,200
disallow the deduction and when people

00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:07,050
get audited they're really afraid but

00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:12,450
the reality is if you can go into an

00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:15,750
audit with documentation substantiation

00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:19,829
which just means prove it and you can go

00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:22,890
in and prove it they'll say okay thanks

00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:24,810
and off you go as a matter of fact the

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,480
first business I ever started

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,970
I got audited and I'm going oh my god

00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,190
and and there was a basis and I hadn't

00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:35,819
claimed any basis I went into the audit

00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:39,420
scared to death and got ten thousand

00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:44,780
dollars out of my own and I said hey you

00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,780
can audit me every year yes

00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:10,819
right they it again it depends it

00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,589
depends on who your agent is if you get

00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:16,430
audited if you don't get on it it's good

00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:19,550
enough you know that I mean because it's

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:23,930
legitimate it's just like with her to $2

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:26,240
giveaway it's a legitimate expense and

00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:29,270
but it's hard to prove you know so she

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:32,270
gives away a hundred dollars into you

00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:35,030
know she gives away actually fifty two

00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:38,569
dollar bills but she claims that she

00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:40,849
gave five hundred two dollar bills so

00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:43,069
she can get a bigger deduction that's

00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:47,089
where the IRS says we got to

00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:48,680
substantiate that but if you can say and

00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,980
look at the calendar there was a

00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:55,130
