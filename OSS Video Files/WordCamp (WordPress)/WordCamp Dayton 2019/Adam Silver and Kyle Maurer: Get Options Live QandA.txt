00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,560
even know movies

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:50,020
no one asked but I'm also drinking a

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,570
chai latte sorry table 33 you're

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,940
delicious now okay how about yourself so

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,070
what am I so I'm wearing a coat is

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,950
poetry shirt because code is poetry it's

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,150
WordPress I am drinking water which is

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,280
on the floor but I'm also drinking it's

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,860
a library a lot of times we record the

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,190
show you know on the weekend we drink

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,780
coffee

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,550
sometimes we drink beer because it's

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,370
late afternoon it's rare but I wish we

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,020
could do that more often but because I

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,270
went ahead and I was told not to bring

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,550
beer to the library so I brought

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:23,710
something extra for myself so excuse me

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,970
once that oh my goodness nice tea that's

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,800
iced tea okay it's in a flask that my 18

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,980
old daughter gave me yeah what someone

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,810
gave it to her when she was 14 there's a

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,840
conversation we had there yeah I think

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,110
so I think so it's awkward and I am

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:45,610
reading an audiobook actually called

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,190
driven to distraction okay it's about a

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,250
TD and ADHD so I'm reading a book called

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:55,900
driven to distraction so nobody know

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,100
didn't work all right squirrel okay it's

00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,480

that joke Wow but before we continue

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,840
there's I want to ask you something okay

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,690
regarding what you're reading we

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,370

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,350
one so this was sent in by Scott deluzy

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,330

in the series than Kyle is so it made

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,990
his day that he heard his name on our

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,930
show which then leads me to the next

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,580
comment then Scott's daughter who was 6

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,830
years old chimes in from the backseat

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,889
and says maybe Kyle should read Little

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,480
House on the Prairie

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:55,489

options are good just know that now okay

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,230
this question comes to us from an

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:24,619
anonymous listener actually I'm curious

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,549
what they're thinking but the question

00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:31,959
is if it's selfish to be self-employed

00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:34,879
whoo what do you think about this man

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:51,769
option one instead it's it's not nearly

00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:55,069
as selfish being a self unemployed I

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:57,230
have an option the answer is yes it is

00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:58,730
it is completely completely selfish I

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,260
know this because I've been told this

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,910
many a time by people in my house

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,100
[Laughter]

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,560
why do you work everyday all day all the

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,570
time why are you so shellfish I mean I

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,130
think they're talking to me but they are

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,320
teenagers so I don't know how to take it

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,780
I don't know I don't think I agree I

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,010
don't I don't think it's I think it's

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,160
especially in the context of WP

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:26,460
freelancing it's a life of service and

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,680
servitude and suffering helping others

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,800
achieve their dreams as you scrape by

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,430
making no money

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,100
yeah nothing could be less selfish

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,410
nothing that's fascinating this entire

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,610
show is being WordPress freelancer the

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,350
weirdest thing from my perspective is

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,420
the fact that we're in person versus on

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,430
skype so this is freaking me out I know

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,870
I'll get over I did you look you're much

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,560
taller in person than you do a look on

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:56,250
video you guys have any other option

00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:01,620
your option or this listener I also

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:03,510
thought I was worth mentioning that it's

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,760
not so much that I'm selfish for being

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:16,380
self-employed it's selfish because I

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:19,340
have a holding company so what do you

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,340
use for that kind of account

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:29,040
do you accept Bitcoin from yourself yeah

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,990
I mean it's an interesting question and

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,670
I consider this question a lot and

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,120
deeply but I didn't write my answer down

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,070
so no I mean it's interesting because I

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,290
am self-employed as you are mmm and

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,740
you're not yeah I'm recovering

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,240
self-employed really yeah okay yeah I

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,530
just feel like it's tough I mean I have

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,050
a high school senior going to college

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:55,250
and the fact that I can't afford any of

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:55,250
that for her at the moment sucks for her

00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,690
I'm okay with my life so I have two

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,840
other boys I'm saving for them so no I'm

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:07,500
kidding another option is not to be

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,000
self-employed that's a great option why

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,800
do you say love that up but you don't

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,050
you mister clients no not for a second

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,709
that's not one moment of my life is

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,869
wasted reminiscing about the days of

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,269
serving clients huh but but now you have

00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:25,279
customers you serve they're my doom yeah

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,019
are they not clients this this in a

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,519
different in a sense laureates and

00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,199
customers think if you let it's a

00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,649
different ballgame in it's a totally

00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,649
different ballgame

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,489
you don't let the code till midnight the

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,639
reason this is a problem is because Alex

00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:16,910
works for me a little bit this explains

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:20,779
a lot WP is hiring a new developer all

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:23,360
right funny alright I think that there

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,499
are elements of this which resonate with

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,209
me okay yeah like I I do recollect I was

00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:32,420
self-employed for five or six years

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,730
right and it was after a couple years

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,999
that things started to get difficult and

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:40,309
I started to get this inkling of an idea

00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:44,720
that maybe this really wasn't the right

00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:48,259
course for me but there were reasons I

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,040
told myself no I got to stick it out and

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:54,170
I think those were the wrong reasons I

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,189
think there was some selfishness and

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:00,169
some pride in my stubbornness over not

00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:03,829
considering other options I had this

00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:07,459
idea that like the idea of having a boss

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:10,010
like I don't have a boss and I don't

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,169
want to have a boss and I was very

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,720
prideful over that and the thought of

00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:17,480
like leaving self-employment to work for

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,260
someone else just didn't appeal to me

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,569
but I had to eventually get over that

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,740
and it took a few years right I mean we

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,539
talked about this before because we knew

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,110
the question a little bit a couple days

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,899
ago

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:33,140
and I will honestly tell you that I used

00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,309
to be very selfish seven eight nine

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,630
years ago I could have had a few

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,200
iterations of my own companies for the

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,570
past 20 but about 7x about seven years

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,700
ago it wasn't a good place I was

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,909
stubborn and I wanted to hold on to that

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,700
thing for way too long which honestly

00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:50,899
almost cost a marriage to be truthfully

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,070
and honest and she doesn't listen to the

00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:57,620
show so yeah you know it's a problem and

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,269
I've more aware of it now I'm cognizant

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,880
of it I joke about the whole College

00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:04,419
thing but I'm also realistic so I'm not

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,649
it's not baloney by any stretch to

00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,299
accept opportunities when they present

00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,980
themselves any which way you know if

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,360
that means I shut down again for a short

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,399
time I do it's not forever it's for now

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,870
so it's important to do things for the

00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:31,039
right reasons right think at the end of

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:33,260
the day right because you because you

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:51,590
feel like that's the best way that you

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:53,600
can make the right okay input right

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,250
alright so we also have a segment to

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,120
play now because one play game well play

a little bit time for audience Q&A at

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,530
the end soon right so think of some good

00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,900
head-scratching questions to just

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,270
stumped us but up coming up next we have

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:08,350
another special guest we do we want to

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:10,179
welcome to the stage Dustin Hartzler all

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,679
right this time I'm gonna read a

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:17,800
question that Kyle and Dustin want

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,750
answer here's the question if is anyone

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,490
doing reoccurring payments subscriptions

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,960
memberships like maintenance packages

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,270
using WooCommerce with stripe

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,800
what will commerce extensions are using

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,890
for the reoccurring functionality that's

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,370
asked by Alastair McDormand he's out in

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:36,190
the I think it's an Ireland oh yeah so

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,230
no no one is doing this literally no one

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,720
is doing this no one's using will Palmer

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:53,950
that's the answer what's next oh

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:55,690
deletable okay yeah it's like like

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,780
PayPal the better isn't it owned by

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,320
PayPal know I know I'm dizzy but just

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,790
you know venmo is owned by PayPal so how

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,160
do you what are some options for I guess

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:10,360
for people doing reoccurring

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,550
functionality with recurring payments

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:23,230
mm-hmm what would you recommend mister

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:28,150
Hartzler so literally what the question

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:30,190
asked what extensions for WooCommerce

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,919
what extensions would he use for

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,850
WooCommerce

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:42,710
all right I'll get serious now starting

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:47,389
now five years later this exact question

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:49,730
so that's why with a reoccurring

00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:53,419
subscription but the purpose of

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,580
WooCommerce in the purpose of using some

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,590
sort of online platform with stripe and

00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,029
reoccurring the cool part about that is

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,749
like they can set it up and then they

00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:12,109
automatically get paid all the time all

00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:20,480
the time is that ethical okay I think

00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:21,710
you get to ask the question stripe is

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,299
kind of built in there's a plugin that

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,070
you can use it can be installed while

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,450
you're installing blue commerce and then

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,789
you would need the subscription plug-in

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,039
and the membership plug-in those we get

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,749
the basic functionality pieces another

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,489
piece that I thought about as I was kind

00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,659
of contemplating this question is

00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,940
there's we have a plug-in called a

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,529
product add-ons and so that would give

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,279
ability if people wanted to like

00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:44,600
actually specify things as part of the

00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,999
checkout process so maybe they say like

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,859
oh I want to I want to get this many

00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:51,230
backups per month or I want to save this

00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:52,609
you know maybe it's a they're selecting

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,159
a membership package but maybe they want

00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:56,239
you know ten the most ten recent backups

00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,879
stored to the cloud and then they're

00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:01,159
deleted or maybe you want to send their

00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:02,299
username and password through clear text

00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,859
and then they get hacked whatever like

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:12,919
you can do that with a product code

00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:14,450
product add-ons and wait what so Kyle

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,109
are you a big fan aren't you a huge fan

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,450
also of woo commerce oh so much the mask

00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:25,869
guy is really charming what is there a

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:29,269
basket still canvas themed deprecated

00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:34,970
yeah yeah so what would you go special

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:39,289
well I would say you want to go you want

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:41,179
to dance let's let's talk shall we

00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,809
the subscriptions add-on for WooCommerce

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:46,460
is the way to go maybe

00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:48,779
prosperous that's a great team and a

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,850
extremely popular plugin so people are

00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,889
doing this stuff left and right but my

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,210
added commentary is the fact that I've

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:58,039
been doing a little research on our

00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,029
market and serving our users and I

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,460
represent an e-commerce plugin that

00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,590
isn't Luke commerce actually but we have

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,179
surveyed our audience extensively and

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,450
one of my interesting findings has been

00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:13,529
that the market of people selling

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:15,480
services online is growing rapidly at

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:16,980
least in our user base I don't know if

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,769
it's if it's the case with WooCommerce

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,350
or other platforms but in our user base

00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,360
in a two-year span people selling

00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,169
services with our plug-in went from less

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,119
than 2% our audience to greater than 10%

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:33,409
so it was like that's an obscure edge

00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,409
case that we didn't pay attention to

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:45,720
correct like subscription services right

00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:47,909
yeah people selling not a product but a

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,289
service instead it was a small part of

00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:50,669
our user base now it's getting becoming

00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,749
a big part of our user base and we can't

00:27:50,669 --> 00:28:04,200
ignore it anymore sure any idea why you

00:27:54,749 --> 00:28:05,309
asked people is a solid selling services

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
is interesting and I think we've

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,210
introduced more plugins that have made

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,639
that possible so it's big it's become

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,889
more viable than it ever was before due

00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:17,450
to some of the complex extensions which

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:19,850
now exist and and there's a lot of

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,340
businesses which have pioneered it and

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,259
led by example moving towards a like a

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,700
subscription online model for selling

00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,440
their their maintenance packages it's

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:40,289
not that's not particularly uncommon

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:42,779
anymore of your business because it

00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:44,309
wasn't built into WordPress right now

00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,779
we're you know if you're in the

00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:50,100
WordPress space you're getting WordPress

00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:53,360
consulting or you're doing work I mean I

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,889
have a in WordPress let's use the tool

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,760
but does it add what's the the theory

00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:59,250
here though I mean I already

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,520
have this I have maintenance packages I

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,200
use stripe or fresh books with stripe so

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,210
I guess I guess it would take that piece

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,440
of the equation out I would have to tie

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,940
into them well it would automate

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,040
everything so that you're descending

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,740
manually sending any invoices you know

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,870
like someone comes to your your store

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,790
your site right and clicks a Buy button

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,260
and signs up right there you have

00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,600
everything right that they need and

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:25,200
automatically continue paying okay what

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,940
are you looking at this is all questions

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,920
that we have answered in our first year

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:34,010
of doing the podcast and like little

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,010
fine print now he's reading the e-book

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,700
services it's an interesting new segment

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,960
it is I think and an iPad I kind of

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,640
argued that it is a little bit

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,920
underserved and growing so if you're

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,620
looking for like you know this is the

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,990
audience which is like kind of using

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,910
tools not made for them for their

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,850
purposes anyways there are people

00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,700
selling their services of a variety of

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:02,880
kinds their consultations their design

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,430
work their ongoing retainer work just

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,110
selling a service using tools designed

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,240
to sell products that's so they're

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:12,210
bending tools not made for them to make

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,130
them fit and this this is a market that

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,020
isn't particularly well served right now

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,910
well I will get people who are out there

00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,770
who who currently in the audience sells

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,270
maintenance has been inspected recurring

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,020
so we have a half a dozen maybe maybe 10

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,350
do you have the question for the

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,180
audience is do you let people

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:34,080
automatically sign up and start payment

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,070
from a website you know you don't you

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,930
why not well

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:42,300
the question would be how do you have

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:45,180
that process worked out okay right or

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,470
use wave symbolize okay the reason I

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,010
asked this question is because back in

00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:52,260
the day when I started concierge for

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,910
with maintenance I thought people sign

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,780
up make the payment and get things going

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,570
right from the get-go

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,730
yeah problem with that is I'm now liable

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,590
I have their money they've signed up

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,300
their site already might be hacked might

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,700
have malware there might be I'm really

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,710
bad hosting and now they're expecting me

00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,960
to clean it for a hundred bucks right

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,950
which could take me hours in theory so

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,679
now I've changed my

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,059
I set up to where they apply for us to

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,889
do maintenance for them I can review

00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,539
their application if you will and then I

00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:20,159
can say yes or no so that way I don't

00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,200
have your money if you're on really bad

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,000
hosting three dollars a month or a buck

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,010
ninety five whatever maybe I can then

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,779
turn it down and it definitely I've

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,029
definitely lost business this way but

00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:32,340
I've also not had any headaches this way

00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:34,820
well that's why selling services is

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,860
complicated it is that's why it's been a

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,440
market slow to come in to online

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,950
automated seller when we build the site

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,269
you production I'm sorry we built like

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,340
nights and then they turn them by its

00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:49,320
nature like you're selling services

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,470
these these are things that are like

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,289
maybe a custom produced after the

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,630
transaction so there are deliverables

00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,549
that come later on payments might be

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,980
coming in stages that makes the

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:04,350
transaction a little more complicated

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,029
there may be necessary like project

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,340
management features or like some

00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:11,279
automated system for demonstrating the

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,200
status there there might be agreements

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,230
and contracts necessary in that

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,090
transaction which plugins do exist there

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,559
are helping solve this problem so that

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,539
you can like introduce us like a

00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,539
signature step in the process of your of

00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,070
your checkout workflow or in like

00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,289
meetings and consultations so like you

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,289
need a book an appointment as a part of

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:33,149
this purchase and that opens up the

00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:35,610
whole calendar issue when are you

00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:37,049
available right and so on and maybe

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,000
files that need to be exchanged

00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:40,980
initially and then later for the project

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,210
to be possible so like selling services

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,000
is fundamentally just more complicated

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,269
than a transaction file as their comp

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,919
product is delivered right yeah it makes

00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:51,269
sense okay it is tricky but it's a I

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:59,600
think it's a growing market maybe people

00:32:51,269 --> 00:33:03,600
should look at it right I can be bribed

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,070
right so now moving on to the segment of

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,309
this one let's play another game shall

00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:11,179
we

00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:13,830
we should it's time for deletable

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:18,119
history

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:24,480
yeah you know can't be gems alright so

00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:29,450
you want explain this one how to play

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,450
it's not only a game so much as its yeah

00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:48,330
yeah so deletable history this is the

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:50,279
segment of something we cringes the back

00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:54,450
of this it's a dirty laundry part of our

00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:56,580
creative endeavors it's not good right

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,619
so first I think I think Dustin is first

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,429
please I hope so let's pick apart an

00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:06,869
early website project shall we that

00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:12,480

to be in video production used to be is

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:21,310
obvious now and it's a 30-second spot is

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:23,590
a familiar sight great selection and

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:28,480
unbeatable prices where Boulder County's

00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:39,670
oldest used-car lot our wish came true

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:41,710
in sprinkler used cars that's painful

00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,680
that's great but that was on TV I was

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,680
paid a lot of money for that and yeah

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:52,360
that was uh that was me my voice my old

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:55,990
assistants Oh nothing's wrong with it so

00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,190
many things were wrong with this we did

00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,020
a couple variations of it and that they

00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,210
actually loved this commercial the the

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,590
client I could never watch this is the

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,650
first time I've swell now I've seen it

00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,270
last night and then today I saw that we

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,260
like you were editing it in post and

00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,450
putting in the smoke

00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,100
oh yeah car and in the genie that was

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,320
that was after after Adobe After Effects

00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,120
Wow we shot it that was her car on the

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,320
side of the road he's well talent more

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,120
than I give you credit for as my old

00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:25,690
assistant to story my old assistants

00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:27,430
name was Montana hanky her middle name

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,860

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,560
crazy so my kids loved her she was a

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,310
great assistant but couldn't accurate

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,460
way out of a

00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,050
out of a jar no it's okay oh yeah they

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,300
they the client liked it we pitched it

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:45,640
we did the storyboards made some money

00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:47,770
and there it is it's painful to see that

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,260
and to hear that so you should put like

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:55,780
if Justin builds you a resume site you

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:57,940
should put this on page yeah

00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,580
all right what do you got an hour all

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,470
right that's so bad it's great it's

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,490
great okay so I found an old blog post

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:09,490
oh yeah of mine yeah so it's a little

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:12,360
old eisah blog back back then it was

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,360
eight yeah

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,220
opened a link you were nine okay so this

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,250
is a month on my blog and so I think you

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,410
can read the long thing but the gist is

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,050
I thought I was so witty and snarky and

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,030
I had some attitude about like people at

00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,010
social media they're always posting

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,110
these like stupid pictures about the

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,270
things that they support and they're

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,040
just all these uninformed people sharing

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,010
their opinions in this confrontational

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,140
manner and so I was like I'm gonna make

00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:45,070
fun of them and I'm gonna make my own

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,960
little little memes if you will a little

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,060
pictures to share on social media and

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,660
I'm gonna like share a whole bunch of

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,150
these see this isn't really deletable I

00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,190
think you should put these out this will

00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,000

we can give you an option for while

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,420
we're thinking we have a question for ya

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,890
like a real head-scratcher stumper

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,480
anyone anyone at all it's puzzling you

00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:52,310
these days his bishop what he been

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,310
reading about that's confusing you

00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,670
probably yeah

00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:13,339
oh sure sure sure

00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:15,919
that's the question is creating a plug

00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:17,959
in a block for Gutenberg correct yeah

00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:20,509
how should it be distributed right if

00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:22,489
it's only a single block is it worth it

00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:24,769
just packaging that as an entire plugin

00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,389
and distributing it that way I would say

00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:28,549
that depends on the nature of the block

00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:29,449
but probably ya know I would go

00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:31,879
different way altogether I would

00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:34,479
actually put that on a probably like a

00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:36,079
little thumb drive and mail those out

00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:39,469
you can do that too

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,849
yeah that's an option we don't know you

00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:51,889
don't need to fill up the repository

00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:55,419
with your code just mail to people come

00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:55,419
back to come back we have nine nine more

00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,929
keep trying but thank you for the

00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:01,399
question

00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:04,249
no I would probably release it as a

00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:05,539
plugin yeah why not I mean you can think

00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:07,459
a little bit about what the future could

00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,279
be like what if this becomes popular and

00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:12,199
what if I really decide I want to invest

00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,639
more in it and I really enjoy it and I

00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,679
get tons of tickets and people are

00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,889
asking can you add this feature in that

00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,839
feature I think about what it could turn

00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:23,569
into and be mindful of that when you

00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:25,219
give it a name and then just just

00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:28,159
imagine like what if someday there was

00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:30,259
like a pro version needed like how would

00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,249
that sound oh no think about it it's a

00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:35,799
pro version you might need a zip drive

00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:38,329
yeah I don't know CD ROMs all the way I

00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:40,549
probably would there's no reason I mean

00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:43,219
there are plugins on the directory bit

00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:45,739
after the plugin header I have no more

00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:48,409
than a single line of code and they are

00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:50,719
useful people download them because they

00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:52,159
solve a problem like better if I verify

00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,779
has a lot more lines of coconut better

00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,609
fly by the way is it makes every

00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:58,599
wordpress website better check it out

00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:03,889
it's on the repo it's a brilliant plugin

00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:05,179
sure yeah anyway the size of the plugin

00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,859
doesn't matter number of blacks doesn't

00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:08,869
matter if it solves problems for people

00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:17,029
and helps them it just makes description

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:18,939
clear and ship it start to use it but

00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:21,349
then you could but also like the whole

00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:22,699
education piece of going

00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,869
putting something on the repository if

00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:26,059
you've never done that that's a good

00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:27,559
learning experience too and then when I

00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:28,609
then you have to support it for the next

00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,839
version of WordPress

00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,400
you know then they'll email you and then

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,319
you have to relearn it all again because

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,690
you have one plug-in on their tour and

00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,799
you know it's it's it's giving back to

00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,579
the community it makes it more visible

00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:41,420
to like people can see it all right

00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,829
awesome

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:48,680
thanks for the question anyone else with

00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:50,359
a question yes mr. Topher Oh what the

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,269
schedule schedule Wow Thank You Topher

00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:55,130
that it's like so wow that's a light and

00:43:53,269 --> 00:44:02,839
sweet it really is like you said he

00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:05,569
wasn't very cool our schedules we come

00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,880
out every week when the show comes out

00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:10,339
is on Wednesdays we try to record weekly

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,229
it's sometimes difficult with some

00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:15,410
travel and more difficult when you have

00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:17,599
a young toddler at home sometimes for

00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,779
scheduling but um we're fairly

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:26,119
consistent on Wednesdays at 5:00 know at

00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:28,009
6 a.m. Eastern hey you want to know the

00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,569
schedule yeah ok this was that the

00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:33,170
question like when the episodes come out

00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:35,209
or it was something further like further

00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:43,660
live shows are currently unscheduled

00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:47,900
like this this has been our substitute

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:50,499
number of occasions anyone else yes mr.

00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,499
Lewis

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:13,060
I would first consider this 40 year old

00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:15,250
daughter to check out Joomla and leave

00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:19,480
me the heck alone I've heard good things

00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:23,440
about expression engine there's also

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,850
cold fusion yeah wow that's one heck of

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,920
a question how much time do we actually

00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,330
have Oh times up I think that there are

00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,520
restrictions for like shipping

00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,050
butterbeer actually yes I would look

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,730
into the regulations about first and

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:38,980
foremost make sure that your state

00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:40,360
approves of said no drop shipping yeah

00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:44,370
that's if you want to send that question

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,370
in we'll make fun of it again next week

00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,280
usually our answers are very well

00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,280
researched

00:45:51,930 --> 00:46:03,610
if you're playing this side of the room

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,060
is pretty quiet which we like any other

00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:11,680
questions anyone else stay on any

00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:16,750
questions okay Oh Thank You Stan yes

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:20,590
Brian oh you can download that from our

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:22,600
WooCommerce store you can buy the

00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:25,810
graphic as a digital download as an

00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:29,200
iron-on I picked these up on the way

00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,640
here and I haven't gotten invoiced from

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,810
my vendor so I don't know how much they

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:39,640
cost yet hopefully it's not that much

00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:42,100
how does that work Oh for me talk to me

00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,480
I figured I like I said if there's

00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,920
demand if people like actually like this

00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,020
cuz it's got all these like questions on

00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,450
it from their show like I'll make more

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,310
nice yeah okay I'm impressed and that

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,990
takes a lot right on it's just a nice

00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:54,220
like athletic material I don't know I

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,600
thought would be a fun choice I thought

00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,960
you would like it I knew I liked it a

00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:02,890
lot do you I do I just are you really

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:08,220
being on it I am okay I saw another hand

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:08,220
raised over there yes ma'am oh yes

00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:10,450
since we have a WooCommerce happiness

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,910
engineer dustin absolutely i'll repeat

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,440
the question for the recording to make

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,000
sure that everybody hears that but the

00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,220
big thing the question was in a nutshell

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,750
like kind of wrapped around is they're

00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,030
using flat rate shipping right now for

00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,400
specific items and it's multiplied by

00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:25,840
the number of items that are in the cart

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,760
so if they have two or three or four

00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,050
different product types when somebody

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,490
buys two or three of those things

00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,380
they're getting multiples like so

00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,500
they're paying shipping for two three

00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,210
four things in a row which in theory

00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,980
makes a lot of sense like if you are a

00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,720
store owner like you're making money on

00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,340
your shipping like you're but that's not

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,500
that's not gonna help you sell things

00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,760
because somebody's gotta check out and

00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,680
they're gonna see forty two dollars to

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,410
ship from you know across the city like

00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,350
they're not gonna buy that we have a

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,870
module at WooCommerce it's called table

00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:58,060
rate shipping and it is like the fast

00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,800
endured flat rate shipping but it's a

00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:03,160
little bit more advanced and so you can

00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,260
program ibly say like if one or two are

00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,670
you know if four shirts one and two it's

00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,380
going to be this price for sure it's

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,540
three four five and six it's you know

00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,630
this flat fee plus one dollar per item

00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,250
you can set a flat rate max of ten

00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,380
dollars for shipping is gonna be the max

00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,490
you can bundle things together so you

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,260
could say if you have one of these and

00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,090
one of these like you can kind of merge

00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,610
it all together so the built in the

00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,530
built in flat rate isn't very robust

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,890
when it comes to WooCommerce so an

00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:32,410
extension is really needed to really

00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:35,110
dial that in the I guess the really only

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,240
other option is to just charge less for

00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,380
shipping and you can't you have to kind

00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,690
of realize when you're doing an

00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,730
ecommerce store shipping is hard like it

00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,620
is really hard especially if you're

00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,810
coming up with the you know what cost is

00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,840
like your in your case it's really hard

00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:51,490
even if you were using like the USPS or

00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,070
FedEx and you're getting live rates in

00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:56,530
for Poland in from an API like to get

00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:58,360
the products packed in the exact same

00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,680
box with the exact same weights and

00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,160
dimensions that WooCommerce is putting

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,010
in it's hard like it's it's just it's a

00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,540
difficult thing so we want to we always

00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,830
recommend like some order

00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,030
are gonna lose a little money in

00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,740
shipping and some orders you're gonna

00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,630
make a little money but in the general

00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,270
scheme of things like it's going to add

00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:17,920
up to very close to you know some orders

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,020
you'll you know you might you might pay

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,490
$2 more than they actually paid you but

00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,230
then other orders you'll pay $2 less

00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,760
than they actually paid you but table

00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,830
rate shipping is going to be the best

00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,360
plugin that's going to be able to let

00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:31,570
you dial in those costs a little bit

00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,950
better yeah cool

00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,860
thanks so glad we had you here this

00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:43,330
right now right well worth the money I

00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:46,330
spent to get here $11.20 I had points on

00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:47,860
Southwest that's a haul so I think we're

00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:50,320
gonna take one more you think we could

00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,950
afford to take one more that's the one

00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,950
more in the back

00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:34,490
off of what was the last part ramp the

00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:40,400
crowd favorite plugin oh we would send

00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:43,370
them to you because we're idiot all

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:47,510
right so the question is did you if you

00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:54,400
have a client's and they're running say

00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:54,400
more time I'm so confused - okay

00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:16,130
right right it's actually it's a good

00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:19,640
question and fairly straightforward how

00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:23,539
do you approach the question of getting

00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:27,380
your clients to migrate to or like

00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:30,410
eventually adopt Guttenberg right 5.1

00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,759
etc right okay okay I think it

00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,299
straightforward and I feel I feel good

00:52:31,759 --> 00:52:36,140
about this one

00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:37,519
I don't okay I wouldn't I would say

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:44,799
stick with classic okay

00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:44,799
like that's alright that's one option

00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:49,279
it's still supported for one out of two

00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,549
years we're good I know I know but okay

00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:55,309
the the ending support for that is not

00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:58,670
really going to be the impetus for all

00:52:55,309 --> 00:53:00,410
sites adopting the modern editor sure so

00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:02,329
I would approach it this way dear

00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:06,670
clients we need to fix your site it's

00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:12,019
$5,000 to fix it starting point one well

00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:19,069
yeah that's your style money you have a

00:53:12,019 --> 00:53:21,709
day job with marketing I think I would

00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:24,680
give an example where like what's what's

00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:26,660
gonna happen is you're you're going to

00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,849
want to go to the new editor it's only a

00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,829
matter of time right you will be coming

00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:35,150
back and asking for this and eventually

00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:36,469
begging for it like it's I don't see

00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,089
that happening that part happening you

00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:40,969
know it I don't see clients saying

00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:42,499
please let us have this no it will

00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:44,719
happen okay will happen then I'm wrong

00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:45,289
think about this I've got a computer in

00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,069
my basement

00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:51,589
okay for like 18 years ago it turns on

00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:54,160
it works okay all the things that it was

00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:57,469
designed to do when it was relevant

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,900
still work we're perfect it does all

00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:03,289
those things okay what it doesn't do is

00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:07,069
all the things that became useful and

00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:10,219
standard and relevant after as of now

00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:13,640
nothing new is getting developed for the

00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:15,230
classic editor so starting now and in

00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,720
the future new

00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,430
things that we're not doing or using now

00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,230
are going to be introduced and you're

00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,930
going to want them and you won't be able

00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:27,170
to use them with the classic ed about

00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:29,180
classic press the fork

00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:31,460
yeah that's not don't try and derail

00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,980
this that's completely off-topic and

00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:36,350
irrelevant the point is this is going to

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,300
happen like with every every month that

00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,130
goes by and every year they're going to

00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,050
be more interesting things developed and

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,540
introduced more new technologies more

00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:48,050
new requests coming in and those are

00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:50,270
going to be built for the future so that

00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,950
is this modern block based editor and it

00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:56,540
sounds as if when this happens that you

00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:58,220
are predictions for you is you are gonna

00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,250
have clients again to talk to about this

00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:06,140
know you're taking this in weird

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:09,800
direction esses Airy job this is not

00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:11,750
just like just some prediction like this

00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,080
is this is just what will happen yeah

00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:17,810
eventually you will see things and you

00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:21,050
will want them and you will not be able

00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:22,670
to have them because it's it's over

00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,800
they'll sit there technically still

00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:27,859
supporting the great classic editor it's

00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,160
like no bugs will be fixed but no new

00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:35,150
features are going to be introduced ever

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:37,160
forever and onwards it's it's the end

00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,380
it's the beginning of the end I'm just

00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,540
so so it's not that striking right now

00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,160
because it hasn't been that long not a

00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,310
lot of new amazing technologies have

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,890
been introduced but pretty soon it's

00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:50,359
going to happen I think one thing I

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,950
thought of was one of the good things

00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,380
you could do is like work with your

00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,790
clients or talk with them and see like

00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,200
what their workflow is for creating a

00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:00,020
new post or new content on their website

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,460
one of the things that like I moved over

00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,460
to Guttenberg early because well

00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,550
whatever but it really changed my

00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,070
workflow like every week I have a

00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:14,869
podcast as well and so by workflow

00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:17,030
completely changed because I couldn't

00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:19,100
paste my markdown block directly in

00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,359
there it just didn't work right and I

00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,340
mean it had one block instead of

00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:23,720
multiples like so I just kind of worked

00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,609
through and figured out how I could

00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,920
change my workflow and it worked better

00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:29,030
so the big thing is like oh how do you

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,010
add images how do you do

00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,960
well I can show you on this thing over

00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,950
here how much easier this will make your

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,840
life yes it's gonna be a little

00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,280
different but you know you have a lot

00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,260
more flexibility there's a lot more cool

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,510
things you can do with this new editor

00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:46,880
so that would be a way if I had clients

00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:48,200
and if I was you know right I mean so

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,490
from my perspective I do run an agency

00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,080
and we are in early talks with clients

00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:56,390
who are running the old versions of

00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:59,870
WordPress I've locked it down there

00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:02,090
running classic for now I mentioned to

00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:04,340
him back in November December for the

00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:06,500
mere fact that they need a refresh site

00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,360
anyway so when we build it it will be in

00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,770
Gutenberg it's a conversation to have

00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,110
but it's not gonna be it's it's a whole

00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,220
new site as well so in that case it's a

00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,990
whole new investment for them

00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,180
it's not gonna be piecemeal it'll be the

00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:18,170
whole thing at once so but it's it's a

00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,620
conversation that has to happen

00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:24,380
what about classic press what about it

00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,450
you can't take it get out all right we

00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,100
should wrap it up we're uh we're done

00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,780
okay this has been really fun this is

00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,220
the guitars podcast so you can find us

00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,240
on iTunes and stitcher and Spotify and

00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,650
all those other places I don't know

00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,360
where we get your podcasts you can send

00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,470
questions if you have them we really

00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,030
would like them that's the lifeblood of

00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:39,470
this show is getting more interesting

00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,030
questions and believe me just read the

00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,220
shirt that I'm wearing we get a lot of

00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:44,720
interesting ones some bizarre questions

00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,340
out of out of there just like

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,510
off-the-wall stuff and those are our

00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,340
favorites we spend a lot of time

00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,840
researching this these topics and

00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,030
