Title: Alex Gustafson: Blazingly Fast Freedom: Headless WordPress and GatsbyJS
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	GatsbyJS has become quite the darling in front-end web development. It runs off popular new technology like React, Webpack, and GraphQL. It generates blazingly fast static sites that are cheap to host and scale. You can use it to make a quick website or an intricate web application. But most importantly it works with almost any data source out there. Enter WordPress from stage left.
WordPress lets the modern developer provide the intuitive, customizable back-end experience that content creators love to use. Headless WordPress provides that same experience while allowing for any front-end development of choice. For your efforts making these ends meet, your visitors are rewarded with sites that load quickly and have the same content awareness they expect from a WordPress site.

thank y'all very much for having me

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,990
speak today working updating in 2015 was

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,459
actually my very first word camp ever at

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,680
the time I was a happiest engineer for

00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:18,600
automatic and budding front-end

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,369
developer and was just kind of getting

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,200
thrown into how great WordPress was and

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,210
this event in 2015

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,890
really was a turning point to realize

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,180
exactly how important the community is

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,360
in WordPress and how much the community

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,160
drives the future of the web and it was

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,140
a life-changing event and without

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,489
hyperbole so think of very much for

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,530
having me in the community and I'm

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,949
really excited to now get to speak at

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,390
this great event so my talk today is

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,820
blazingly fast freedom which is a very

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,070
silly phrase life and thinking about for

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,039
several months which is basically using

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,989
headless word pressing guess PJs

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,030
if you want to fall over here the comp

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,569
folks like to go along with everything

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,729
you can go to WC date in 2019 dot Alex J

00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:01,289
custom tech it's these exact slides

00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,010
that's what I'm running off of hope it

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,479
doesn't crash see I guess essentially

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,719
what we're going to go through is

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,810
discuss like what this idea of running a

00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,130
headless WordPress with Gatsby is doing

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,219
a quick setup of what it will look like

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,799
in the end a few pointers on how you can

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,799
get started with Gatsby once you have

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,909
that project running and I'd love to

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,350
consider that you can then just take

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,049
this on your own projects going forward

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,549
if you want guys get a quick show of

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,259
hands in the room how many folks in here

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,960
would identify as a developer good this

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,140
is definitely a topic that we could do

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,759
for six hours instead of 30 minutes and

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,979
I'm not going to be going that deep into

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,180
it this is going to be a hey if this

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,439
sounds likely you want to get into

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,310
hopefully it's a good starting point and

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,130
then you can go off to the races

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,409
yourself and if it seems like it's not

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,149
for you it's probably not this is either

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,469
something that it's been polarizing for

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,670
a lot of folks either it's like this is

00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,590
a great opportunity I really want to

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,109
learn how to do this or it's a you know

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,270
what not for me and we'll see who you

00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,020
are at the end of the talk but we'll

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,329
just get started with this

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,849
so first off is just what is this

00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,380
blazingly fast freedom and you sure the

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:13,239
freedom part is WordPress and that's why

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,459
we're here that's why this is a work

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,280
camp talk there's a reason why WordPress

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,050
is a third of the web because when you

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,090
and I and the rest of the community

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,340
contribute to WordPress we're doing it

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,489
with the idea of freeing up and

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,170
empowering content creators in mind a

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:32,260
wordpress always should be made with the

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,480
idea of allowing freedom across the web

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,790
for everybody the mission of WordPress

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,430
is democratizing publishing and that

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,730
recently published that an update to

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,480
what that mission means to him in 2018

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,370
means that people of all backgrounds

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,690
interests and abilities should be able

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,670
to access free isn't speech software

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,880
that empowers them to express themselves

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,239
on the open web and to own their content

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,850
so long as we are developing sites with

00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,380
that freedom in mind I think it is a is

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,959
a great thing for everyone and it's

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,130
certainly among the goal of WordPress

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,870
interesting even though there is nothing

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,299
here that says by golly we should use

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,570
PHP templates there's nothing here that

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,730
says by golly it should all be in one a

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,709
wordpress repo every time and that's the

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,000
way it should be done that's not what

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,010
the point of WordPress is the point

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,230
WordPress is freedom and empowerment is

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:25,420
not about any particular technology

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:27,970
stack with that in mind there is a tool

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,530
that as I was learning JavaScript deeply

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,850
I kind of fell in love with and a lot of

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,970
the JavaScript community is falling in

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:37,060
love with called guess PJs and of the

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,380
blazingly fast freedom gatsby is the

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,959
blazingly fast part you should go to

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,470
gatsby GS org they say blazing fast

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,019
sites

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,900
I like adverbs so I go blazing late

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,450
that's just the way I girl but all the

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,900
gaps pjs really is is a static site

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,269
generator you can use any kind of data

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,060
you want you can use markdown files on

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,430
your local computer but you can develop

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,530
a site with gatsby and it will fetch

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,359
data it will do transformations you can

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,780
use NPM packages you can do whatever you

00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,220
want

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,829
but in the end it's going to spit out

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,200
static files if you think about it if

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,630
you had a quest to make the fastest site

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,930
possible you could if I say you have to

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,340
have some JavaScript some CSS but you

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,690
have to give you a website

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,310
what would you do to make it as fast as

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,560
possible well one I might cry to make it

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,650
as small as possible what if I could

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,150
just have an index.html file that has

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,330
some in mine script tag at the bottom

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,370
that does a console log it has a inline

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,199
style tag at the top that just has a

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,910
tiny little bit and it will run great

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,410
now that's really sinking fast I can put

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,870
it up on a server I can put a CDN in

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,400
front of it that one static file doesn't

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,169
take hardly anything from our web server

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,250
to load right we all agree there static

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,139
file is pretty awesome

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,900
as soon as you have 500 of them man

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,460
static files are not fun and that's why

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,220
we've kind of got this evolution over

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,620
the last couple decades of CMS's of all

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,810
these different frameworks of making

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,630
living servers generate these pages for

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,490
us as opposed to managing files gatsby

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,669
is kind of this play of what's coming

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,330
called the jam stack javascript api so

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,740
yeah marco way swear but this is a

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,479
server-side render approach we're going

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,280
into that javis Jam stack application

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,020
but all we really want is a bunch of

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
static files at the end so if you're

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,919
using Gatsby theoretically you could

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,990
just run it all on your computer run

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,120
Gatsby build on your computer push all

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,000
those files up into any server you want

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,950
and it's gonna work great but if you

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,090
stop there

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,470
it's what are you gonna do whenever you

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,180
want to add more data you have to open

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,220
up your prot to it again if you have to

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,710
be a developer to do this stuff that is

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,180
not empowering knowing that you have to

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,550
be part of a JavaScript communities you

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,260
have to be identified as a developer you

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,270
have to use a text editor get and all

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,720
this stuff that's not empowering at all

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,550
so even the Gatsby folks when they were

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,530
looking to make this tool the reason it

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,810
came about was they were looked at three

00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:00,250
things that on the web were evolving

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:02,080
very rapidly headless CMS is modern

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,710
development tools and the need for

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,450
website performance as more people

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,340
around the globe need to access websites

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,200
and they may or may not have great

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,789
connections to do it the new BL two

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,860
loads website fast becomes more more

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,060
valuable to them and therefore more and

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,849
more valuable to the people that are

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,660
needing to serve them there's more and

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,889
more developers that are trying to

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,330
create more and more sites we need a

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,520
great developer experience we're making

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,039
them and there's still content creators

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,240
that need to edit that content that need

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,950
to be able management that don't have

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,930
the technological expertise to be making

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,580
the sites the way to develop dust

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,680
so what's in the middle and Gatsby is

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,540
trying to be that told that that is

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,180
helping all three of them connect they

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,130
call it the content mesh that's because

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,120
Gatsby's is domme little world it's a

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,880
completely different community from

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,190
WordPress but I think WordPress fits

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,350
very nicely on the headless CMS side of

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,580
this deck there's a lot of people in the

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,280
Gatsby world we'll go to things like

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,330
using sanity or contentful and and

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,080
there's something wrong with any of

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,870
those I uniquely feel that WordPress has

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,310
the motivations of content creators in

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,080
mind more than anybody because of that

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,300
mission of freedom that mission of

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,039
empowerment that when changes are made

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,780
to WordPress it is with the intent of

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,940
making sure content creators getting the

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,130
best experience possible and if that

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,750
means that I have to develop my modern

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,560
tools in a way that adopts for that

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,190
great

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,600
I want that burden on the user developer

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,669
so that's why I started thinking about

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,990
this stack has blazingly fast freedom

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,210
because I get all the blazingly fast

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,280
stuff gatsby I get the freedom of

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,630
WordPress I get to spread that message

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,400
around in something I really believe in

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,349
it's something that I think is really

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,510
great for the world but in the end it

00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:41,710
boils down to using WordPress and using

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,210
Gatsby has pleasingly fast freedom so

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,580
now we're just going to do a simple what

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,900
this basically looks like if you're of

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,280
the camp that wants to follow along I've

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,409
already got an example site up it's

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,909
running it's not beautiful they tell us

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,650
how to be beautiful it would be like

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,880
what you can get at in one session if

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,360
you want to start running this up

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,620
yourself but the goal of this setup is

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,539
gatsby is basically your project that

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,099
you're gonna be working on and it's

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,349
going to talk to a live WordPress site

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,479
and that WordPress site is meant for

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,039
holding data it's meant for your content

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,440
creators to go in and add a blog post

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,210
edit a blog post add a page edit a page

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,580
delete a page if you want to use menu

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,620
doing all that stuff that we do in the

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,750
backend of WordPress but we're not going

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,729
to use the theme template hierarchy we

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,810
don't have to use a theme at all we're

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,349
going to use gasping to make that

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,849
front-end instead so start with you're

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,099
gonna want to install WordPress you can

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,479
do this on your local machine for the

00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,650
second example probably simplest just to

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,339
go ahead and throw it up on a server

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,870
somewhere you're for ease of making sure

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,089
that this all happens in your mind I

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,650
like putting on a subdomain so my

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,270
example that I've got is going to be on

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,300
WP Widgit pet would use of my dog

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,230
she loves WordPress too but

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,060
so right now I've got that I sign up

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,350
it's just running 2019 it's just stock

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,990
it's got some blog post has got some

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,580
pages nothing crazy going on there but

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,140
I'm just gonna use it for the data and

00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm just going to talk to through the

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,020
REST API

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,970
it could be you could host this

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,160
WordPress site anywhere put on any

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,339
server you want we were first calm even

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,230
I would avoid using any plugins until

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,970
you start getting rolling particularly

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,649
if it's not about storing data so the

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,060
wedding will unplug I would allow is or

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,190
you can do whatever you want your site

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,390
don't allow anything but basic Enfield's

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,070
is pretty useful with doing this stuff

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,300
and I'll show you setting that you can

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,500
you turn off you can use advanced custom

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,930
fields but then something like a form

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,910
builder is maybe not gonna be as useful

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,990
the main value of a form builder being

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,580
it's gonna spit out a form on the front

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,080
end we're not using the WordPress right

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,940
then so I'll probably instead of

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,000
performed on my own in my Gatsby project

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,370
so step one set up WordPress hosted

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,020
somewhere

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,290
step two is getting your gatsby

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,839
development environment running node NPM

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,339
and get all pretty standard for doing

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,230
development or if you're if you've not

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,149
gotten used to using node NPM and get

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,470
this is not the talk to like walk

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,450
through that if you click this

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,459
documentation link though that will

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,990
point you to the Gatsby CLI section but

00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,970
it's actually part of a long tutorial of

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,860
all of this so if you've never installed

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,720
no never installed in p.m. you can still

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,670
walk through that essentially there is

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,920
command-line tools to get things running

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,420
on your computer and then get as version

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,370
control but you're gonna want running

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,370
because we're gonna use a git repo in

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,899
the cloud Gatsby CLI though probably not

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,399
everybody has going there's a couple

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,899
ways that you can use it one is to

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,560
install it globally you can get it off

00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,660
NPM Gatsby - CLI or you can use npx know

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,450
that the thing and that's going to give

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,820
you a couple new command lines

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,459
commands gatsby new gatsby you develop

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,959
and gatsby built that's to create a new

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,520
gatsby project kind of like how you

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,579
might create a new create react app

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,589
product to start up your development

00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,420
environment where you get localhost hot

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,130
reloading and it'll do all your queries

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,899
and it'll update as you update data it

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,250
will go ahead and update your do all the

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,860
screen for you it's pretty sweet and

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,079
gatsby built that actual process of

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,470
making all your static files that you

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,640
can then push up to it server somewhere

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,650
once you have all four of those running

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,040
the the same way you might need to pick

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,269
a theme

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,920
we're press they're gonna pick a starter

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,300
in Gatsby it's not quite exactly the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,290
same thing but this is all your

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,940
boilerplate code

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,560
it's just what gets you going there are

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,029
starters that do nothing but print hello

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,050
world out to the page and then you can

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,600
do it all yourself but the file

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,610
structure is there for you this is a

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,750
good starter to go with just for this

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,060
talk that's what I use for my example

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,449
site only because they have already

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,949
written a lot of stuff out of the box

00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,569
that will talk to your WordPress site if

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,519
you just give it the URL grab all the

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,199
pages grab all the posts grab all the

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,399
categories do all that stuff for you and

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:33,630
it's a great example of how to get

00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:38,130
started with this stack so I said let's

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:41,790
even look at this for a moment this is

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,079
the Gatsby starter library so in the end

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,100
once we get this all rolling you're

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,019
basically end up with a site like this

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,120
where it's going to grab all the pages

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,620
from your WordPress and spit it out into

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,250
a navigation it'll grab all your latest

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,509
posts and put it in a blog like layout

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,509
the way you would get it going is

00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,819
running gatsby new again that's after

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,500
you have Gatsby CLI installed the name

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,180
of your project and then pulling this

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,290
source of this starter you can choose

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,699
any starter you want once you're

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,899
comfortable with all this this is just a

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:13,560
good starter for now and it's what I've

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:15,329
got my example site using wouldn't it

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,470
pick for the starter though is on that

00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,880
WordPress that you set up you have to

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,470
make sure you have at least one post and

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,300
that put at least one post needs to have

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,500
a tag on it I don't know why the tag

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,029
thing but just the transformer they

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,740
built it all breaks if you don't do that

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,600
so make sure you just leave the static

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,310
post hunt the starter post on there and

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,839
add a tag to it then when you run this

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,910
starter you'll be golden once you have

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,500
your develop environment set up you're

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,420
going to open up one of the files in the

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,149
root directory called Gatsby convict je

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,800
s kind of like WP config and a standard

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,860
WordPress site this is all the stuff the

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,420
Gatsby needs just to even get running if

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,010
when you add plugins for to talk about

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,079
in a second you're gonna add those in

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,160
here and the way this starter already

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,810
has a bunch of plugins running already

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,019
but the first thing if the definitely

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,930
change is the base URL and in this case

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,850
I put it in my WordPress sites WP digits

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,040
pet you'd put in wherever you've

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,230
installed your WordPress site

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,550
if a hosting on WordPress com just set

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,680
that to true if you're using advanced

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,079
custom fields if that's a true the

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,490
starter will then kick off

00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,199
the config is something you're gonna be

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,819
editing as you add more plugins new

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,389
features later on but this is just to

00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:23,130
get you started once you have that you

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,899
can you actually can get going on your

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,509
computer at that point you can run gasp

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,980
you develop all the build processes will

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,980
kick in it'll give you a local host URL

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,690
you can work on but for just look at

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,100
this example after that you go on put it

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,959
up to github if you want to get

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,190
elaborate Buckley those fine too and in

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,930
this world github is kind of the

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,490
standard a lot of the hosts that

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,470
specialize in helping with catsby tools

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,600
have a lot more integrations with github

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,240
just kind of way to go so if you want to

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,389
check out my example site one it is

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,880
there and after that when you're

00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,620
considering hosting you're gonna want to

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,870
have a continuous integration and here's

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,279
what I mean with that if you were to

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,380
just build all the files on your

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,600
computer you could put all of them into

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,980
an Amazon s3 bucket and just storage you

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,230
can point your domain to that history

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,490
bucket it'll all work and you put cloud

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,959
4 in front of it it'll be great but what

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,759
happens then if you make a new blog post

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,230
on your WordPress site you've got to

00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,610
open up your computer that's run Gatsby

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,860
build you have to push all those files

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,339
back up to s3 again ain't nobody got

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,750
time for that

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,009
that's where we're going to bother doing

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,269
all this setup we're gonna do this the

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,329
right way which is we're going to tell a

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,189
server hey whenever I tell you to run

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,660
this Gatsby build push all that and

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,920
we're gonna serve all that stuff out and

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,589
every time we need to change it we're

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,630
going to change it so you can do this in

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,009
the an infinite number of ways and an

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,170
infinite number of services you can roll

00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,550
your own if you want the website is a

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,709
temple site it's using a host called

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,569
notify which is basically a host and

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:46,920
continuous integration bundled all in

00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:48,300
one they give you a a web hook where

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,480
you're you can trigger that build

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,949
process from anywhere you want and it'll

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,860
also connect to a github repo so every

00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:58,079
time you change that repo it'll update

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,279
with that in mind on your WordPress site

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,709
you're going to want to add a deploy

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,779
plug in some way that your content

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:05,880
creator can make changes trigger a

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:08,550
deploy and it will tell your host to run

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,199
that Gatsby build process this is the

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,730
Wild West right now there's maybe a

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,649
dozen or so plugins if you search around

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,410
on github that will accomplish something

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,790
of this nature I don't like any of them

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,230
I've tried building my own I don't like

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,180
any of those either so I'm not gonna

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,350
recommend my own but this is the one

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,790
that I actually use when I'm doing this

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,760
particularly cuz it works really well

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,370
with Delphi

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,800
and it kind of follows the give you a

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,630
big button approach so whenever you're

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,610
in WordPress and I add a new post or I

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,310
edit the post or I had a new page or

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,140
delete something after I've done all my

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,800
stuff I want to do I can just do one big

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,020
deploy push the build site button and

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,750
it'll hook up some Adelphi after I give

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,270
it all my information so with that might

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,730
let's actually just give it a try for a

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:58,080
second

00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:00,000
so this is the current build of my gosh

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,500
site it's not what to look at because

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,120
this is just what the starter gave me I

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,340
didn't add any extra styles or anything

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,690
like that I changed out all the names of

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,670
the developer that created the starter

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,680
just to make it good dog widget the name

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,360
of the site instead so you can see that

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,300
it's loads really snappy and that's

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,110
really the advantage of using Gatsby is

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,570
just this quick performance everywhere

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,160
but then on the WP side looks simply

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,130
different because this is running 2019 I

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,630
could port over all those styles into

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,670
here and try to make it match close as

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,720
possible but the point is it really

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,610
doesn't matter what's running on your

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,470
WordPress site because we're not gonna

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,940
use this front-end at all in a real

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,860
production situation actually just to

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,300
just by team but if any one ends up

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,550
looking at this site I'm gonna forward

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,720
them on to my real Gatsby site I don't

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,170
want any really looking at this

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:51,290
front-end but just for trying out

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,290
something well it's a new page

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,319
cool so I published this page nothing's

00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:06,110
gonna happen yet because I have to

00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:09,049
deploy this out so I'm gonna go to my

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,339
deploy and win a hit build site I've

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,990
already done all the stuff that will

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:16,039
connect this to my network by hosting

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,510
and it's curly building so honestly I've

00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:21,140
found it's taking about a minute or so

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,339
to build so while that goes here's what

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,829
it would look like on the net with high

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,149
end so you use a different host or if

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,529
you roll your own obviously this is good

00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:30,320
look a little differently but the idea

00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:33,679
is I can trigger any number of deploys I

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,600
want from WordPress on my hosting it'll

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,860
update it'll run that gas tube you'll

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,360
process to serve up the new files

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,059
instead purge all the caches all that

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,549
stuff if I did make change to my github

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,980
repo if I change the the template add a

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,080
new class has some new CSS as soon as I

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,399
urge that into master I've gotten Elif I

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,769
watching on master branch

00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:53,750
it was rebuild debt so any time either

00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,760
developer or a content creator is making

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,169
a change it's just automatically a real

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,149
built rebuilding all the site for me

00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:02,720
pretty cool so I get all the advantages

00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:06,169
of that static build just by adding some

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,320
processes and then cool so now that is a

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:12,230
success so that took a little less than

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,320
it maybe and let's just refresh and

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:20,450
there's how you work camp Dayton no big

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,070
deal right now that is still not a zero

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,779
amount of time and as the site gets

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,299
bigger it might take a little more I

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,409
would say on a typical WordPress site if

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,760
you're thinking just like a blogger

00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,860
we're gonna have updating a new blog

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,450
post every day or so it would not be

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,490
strange to me if this bill time gets

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,139
more to five or six minutes instead of a

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,029
minute on a really quick site if you're

00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,909
hitting a private API and it's really

00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:43,070
nicely made and it might be more like

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:44,659
twenty seconds but that's gonna be one

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,130
of the determinations of whether or not

00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,590
this stack is actually a good fit for

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,760
you if you're running TechCrunch and

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,139
you're having new articles come out

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,059
every 30 seconds from a billion

00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:55,100
different authors that rebuild is gonna

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,779
take longer than it takes to keep

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,730
updating the content all of a sudden

00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:00,470
it's not worth that time I'd rather have

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,940
that 30 seconds of the article being up

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,440
then waited for it to rebuild again

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,840
because I have got other tools to write

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,549
there's other stacks available but this

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,409
is one of the quirks of gatsby is having

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:11,480
to trigger that rebuild but you get all

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:13,309
the performers benefits afterwards

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,380
so my general wolf phone has been if

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,909
it's something that's going to update

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,860
irregularly or only a couple times a day

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:23,450
this is a really great thing to reach

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:26,510
for yeah that's the that's essentially

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,909
what we're looking at so I was using

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,470
Neto Phi as the host there you can

00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:32,179
really host these gatsby sites anywhere

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,390
they're kind of run fast on anything

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,549
because it's just static pages it's hard

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,450
to make them run slow really so what

00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:41,360
you're going to want to make your

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,860
choices of where to host is based on

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
that continuous integration how much of

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,980
the work are you excited to do on your

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,990
own versus how much do you want another

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,980
hosted that's kind of in this world to

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,630
do it for you and it's kind of

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,809
developing this is this is it's a Wild

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,980
West kind of area right now so there's a

00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,299
lot of great Doc's I think the log

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,450
people are kind of going towards either

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,679
notify or to doing AWS if you're going

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,350
to be doing a lot of other random

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,429
functions and stuff like that that's

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:13,520
just kind of my read on situation ok so

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,380
we have our WordPress site that's

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,700
running it we're just using for holding

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,220
and fetching data we have our Gatsby

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,500
site that's reading all that stuff what

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,900
does it actually like to be working in

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,210
this well if you're used to making a

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,270
react application it kind of feels the

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,710
same so for example this is the template

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,700
that's going to run for any given page

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,840
whenever gatsby builds its it's going

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,159
through and fetching everything any of

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,990
the api and is going to create a new

00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,340
page for all pages of fonts and it's

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,760
going to throw all that into the context

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,110
of this template and this is a very

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,090
simple template because just divs and

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,030
class names but you started this is just

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,530
a very typical reactive feel of JSX

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,730
so anything you want to do in react you

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,470
basically you can just go for it at this

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,690
point in Gatsby but want to go through

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:04,250
some of the Gatsby quirks and

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,690
fundamentals so and we're making a react

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,700
application you're going to be used to

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,409
using yarn or NPM to add in modules all

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,110
the time right and for the most part you

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,490
just do NPM install Garn install and

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,740
then follow documentation of what says

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,720
of how to implement it in the

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,610
immobilization appropriate place in your

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,039
application the the quirk about this and

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,559
gatsby is so many of the things that

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,940
gatsby will do for you for

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,090
these performance opposition's happen

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,100
during that build step so if a it does

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,749
when when Gatsby does push on the file

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,059
it comes with a react runtime so you can

00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,860
use almost any module you would use in a

00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,639
reactor application but if it's

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,080
something that's gonna be about

00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:41,269
transforming that data working with the

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,980
date you want to look for a gas begin

00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,840
now I guess plug in to go along with it

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,120
so for instance if you're using react

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,580
helmet there's also a Gatsby react

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,429
helmet that you want to configure into

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,320
your project and the way that looks like

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,320
it's in that Gatsby config file you'll

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,369
find an array of plugins a lot of the

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,350
plugins are just going to be those

00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:02,480
one-liners naming what the module name

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,549
is and then you get that modules

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,110
features great some of them a little

00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,029
more complex you'll have to also pass in

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,169
options so for example that gatsby

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,690
source wordpress if you're looking at

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:13,190
it's not enough just to have that one

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,960
line of gas because WordPress we have to

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,519
resolve that and then also pass in the

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,590
object of options for the base URL

00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,940
whether it's hosting wordpress comm or

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,159
not whether it's using advanced custom

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,090
fields or not different plugins just

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,730
going to have different amounts of

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,350
complexity there but that's something

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,450
gonna have to get used to as is as you

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,070
find a new module that you want to use

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,779
the advantage of it is adding into your

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,669
Gatsby comic big if you're in your local

00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,950
restart your development server trigger

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:41,840
rebuild watching for it when it goes

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:43,369
production there are a couple of phrases

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,070
when you're looking at plugins that

00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,539
you're gonna find source plugins it

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,039
basically just means this is a plug-in

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,860
that's intention is to fetch data from

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,110
somewhere so gatsby source wordpress is

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,610
a plugin but it's a plugin that's meant

00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,019
about getting data out of the wordpress

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:02,119
api a transform plugin is a plugin to be

00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:04,369
used usually in coordination with some

00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,389
particular source plugin where after

00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,539
we've gotten that data

00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:10,639
how does gatsby expected to be formatted

00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:13,970
and put it into all the magic that it's

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,619
going to do to be honest yuki there's

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,539
great documentation on how to author

00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,889
source plug-ins cheerful plugins it is

00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,899
not something i've gotten into very much

00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:22,190
yet so if you're expecting to have that

00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,960
magic revealed i'm sorry I'm just not

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,039
ready for it

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,360
but that's something you're gonna you're

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,059
gonna run into a lot as you're searching

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,529
through plugins if you find source or

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:34,789
transform in there that's all it's

00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:37,250
referring to so graph QL again another

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,419
topic that would be great for a workshop

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,190
or a few hour long

00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,509
we're not gonna get too much of the weed

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,759
toilets but you're gonna see it Eliezer

00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:46,279
we're Gatsby because it's the query

00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,859
language that is actually how Gatsby is

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,029
managing data we'll talk in a second how

00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,470
you don't actually have to use graph QL

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,759
but most of the starters that you're

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,429
going to be downloading are going to be

00:23:52,759 --> 00:24:00,139
using it so for example if we keep

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:01,429
looking at that page the jas this

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:04,669
actually the very at the very bottom of

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,710
the file but that's our this is our

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,269
graph QL query the idea of it is it

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,609
looks kind of like JSON but it's not

00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,529
JSON it's just how field crew language

00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:16,100
works but the goal of this is to when I

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:18,559
run my query for a wordpress page I want

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,779
the title and the content and only the

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,639
title of the content when we're working

00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,779
with a REST API were used to we're

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,220
hitting our end point and we're gonna

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,869
get back way more information that we

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,239
need and then it's up to us to kind of

00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,460
map through it and find what we want and

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:33,499
spit it out the goal of graph QL is to

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,720
get no have no over fetching at all and

00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:38,389
if works really well during this build

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,059
process because we are essentially doing

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,769
that over fetching first when it's not

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,330
affecting our user at all it's doing you

00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:46,070
over fetching during the build sorting

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,470
down to exactly what we want and then

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,929
it's easy to make the templates work

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,269
nicely so gonna run into those graph QL

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,549
queries and you might be asking yourself

00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:56,840
well that's great it looks for something

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,179
straightforward to get a wordpress page

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,549
by an ID and receive as title of content

00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,350
but how in the heck did you know to make

00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:06,019
that query like that well the good news

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,940
is your gatsby project ships with

00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:09,649
graphical which is an IDE for how you

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,499
can search out and find these graph QL

00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:14,330
queries once you have your source

00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,619
plugins running and it's fetching this

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,409
information you restart your develop

00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:20,179
server one of the links that gatsby

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:24,259
develop will give you is a link to your

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:26,419
graphical where as you try out queries

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,279
on the Left panel you'll get the

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,049
definitions of how those queries work on

00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:32,059
the right and then you can test them out

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,190
and see examples of what you'd get so

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,899
for example if I just started off with a

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,580
query that's looking for WordPress page

00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,739
I would get all these definitions on the

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,359
right for WordPress page now it's Co I

00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:44,659
don't I don't have to just get titled

00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:47,090
and ie I can also get the date I can get

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,700
type I can get the content the excerpt

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,620
it's parent

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,559
it's ping status if I want to check for

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,240
that and I cannot put all those my

00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,740
queries so then I updated my query on

00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,360
the left to not to be Thailand ID but

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:03,250
then date and slug in the status and

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,130
type on that page je s it has there's

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,420
kind of a context to this template of

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,700
passing an ID into it so we're filled

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,680
when it's running this query it's

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,230
looking for only a wordpress page where

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,070
it's ID is equal to the ID we're passing

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,390
so for the heck of getting a nice result

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,340
here on the right I passed in the idea

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,929
of that about widget page I can see

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,480
exactly woman yet so now whenever I want

00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,710
to query data on my template I know what

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,020
happens when I go to day that WordPress

00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,490
page title ID date and if I ever just

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,050
wants to never have date I can keep my

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,770
code really clear by never querying for

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:37,480
date so again graph QL kind of its own

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,890
budding world that Gatsby just makes you

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,120
stuff you're gonna run into it a lot

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,910
though as you try a bunch of different

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,650
Gatsby starters or make use of source

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:48,670
plugins that's kind of the default in

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:50,440
Gatsby world but if you don't use graph

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,410
you can start our data which is

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,120
basically just a fancy way of saying you

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,980
can fetch data however you want it and

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,740
there's an API for creating pages

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,470
normally in Gatsby if we have a file in

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,600
a in the page of directory then it'll

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,679
create a page for all of those but when

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,030
wherever we're fetching from outside

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,040
source so we're using this create pages

00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:14,020
API to pass a context to a template and

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,929
spit it out for as many pages as we need

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,670
and with that in mind why can't we do so

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,260
with the WordPress REST API that's what

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,750
this starter is actually doing it's it's

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,040
actually doing a REST API and turning it

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,960
into graph QL so that you can use a

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,730
gradual query you could have just as

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,750
easily skip that graph QL stuff you can

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,940
query the REST API

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,429
on your own and just get an array of

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,490
posts and map through them and use this

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:39,429
create pages API on your own so whenever

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,600
you're working with a private API or if

00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,980
you're just wanting to get used to

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
gatsby the first time we not learn

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,620
graphic you all the use gatsby

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,230
unstructured data is a really great way

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,059
to do that and this page is a really

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:54,570
good approach for it it uses the Pokemon

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,570
API so it's a lot of fun to work through

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,770
link's one of the great things about

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,890
Gatsby is that it does prefetching based

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,870
on intersection observers so whenever it

00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,600
will not prefetch a page that's linked

00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,340
to until the link is on the page and

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,320
even then it has like a hierarchical

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,490
sense of which links are more important

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,530
so some of the weight still you're

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,550
actually hovering over but it's really

00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,020
great that as soon as the user is

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,250
hovering over a link it starts

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,510
prefetching that page because this is a

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,610
good chance they're going to be loading

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,960
that page soon one of the ways it does

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,400
that though is with this link component

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,580
and I think it's internal to your site

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,460
instead of using in a with nature F use

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,530
a link with a capital L and put in the

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,720
route and Gatsby will do some magic with

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,940
this if you use an anchor tag like

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,170
normal it will still work yeah that's

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,330
what you should do for external links

00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:45,770
but Gatsby just some great stuff with

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:49,370
link so yeah from there on out just

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,690
treat it like a react app you can do

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,310
components do you nested components you

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,610
can do modular CSS you can add in

00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:57,440
packages it Gatsby is just react at the

00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,960
end of the day the static files with the

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,450
react runtime so tree like react up you

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,580
won't go to rock few minutes just on

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,830
pros and cons so like I said before if

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,000
this sounds exciting it sounds like oh I

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,420
really want to learn more about this

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,460
this is for you and I hope you'll learn

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,550
more about it if this sounds like oh

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,480
this is not like what I'm wanting it

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,930
just doesn't seem like it solves my

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,580
problem

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,020
great it probably doesn't solve your

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,880
problem because it does come with its

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,590
own set of problems that rebuild can be

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,660
annoying under some circumstances

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,250
it's very j/s having on the developer

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,680
side and if you're not relying wanting

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,820
to have that JavaScript feel it's not

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,590
going to be that great developer

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,180
experience and the whole point is to

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,740
have a great developer experience a

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,810
great consecrate experience and a great

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:43,160
site visitor experience and you can get

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:44,900
that in a number of sects so that the

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,950
idea that it doesn't feel like WordPress

00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,570
is only because we're keeping WordPress

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,180
for the conduct a tur that it was going

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,410
to get the most valuable out of it but

00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,520
if you really like the way that the word

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,670
plus temporary works or you really

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,440
wanted to focus on PHP great so long as

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,180
we're all agreeing that like we should

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,470
be making sure that all three of those

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,610
stakeholders are having great experience

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:10,639
that's exactly the

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,769
I would say the biggest reason that most

00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:13,970
people are gonna find a problem with

00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,720
getting this is because the hosting

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,769
setup feels really complicated and I

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,019
think we're gonna see more and more

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,970
hosts like nullify that are trying to

00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,259
make this easy out of the box in that

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,450
way you can have more options than just

00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:28,429
nullify or just a particularly interview

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,970
I step that you can roll on your own but

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:33,559
it's it's hard to convince a client

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,239
necessarily that this isn't their best

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,279
interest to have a twice as complicated

00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,899
hosting setup once to get all these

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,309
benefits in the future especially when a

00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,559
lot of those benefits from the hosting

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:44,779
side end up being for the end-user and

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,739
not necessarily for them even the idea

00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,929
that now you're gonna have to push a

00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:49,450
button twice you have to push no deploy

00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,889
button after you make all your changes

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,960
feels like a hassle even though you get

00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:56,090
all the good stuff from it so there's

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,279
lots of pros and cons to way I would

00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,649
follow your intuition if you really like

00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,419
this idea of doing what WordPress does

00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:05,210
best with that content creator

00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:07,940
experience in WordPress and then getting

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,350
to use react if that is like the selling

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,690
point for you then this is absolutely

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,179
one thing to look into if getting to use

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,239
react sounds horrible it's not going to

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:19,909
be fun because it is react to the core

00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:22,249
so at the end some advanced stuff if you

00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:23,779
really want to go deeper and deeper if

00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:26,389
you like the graphic you outside

00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:28,159
Jason Valle have been doing wpq fql for

00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,450
a little while now it's still officially

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,210
invaded but there's a lot of production

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,519
sites using debut SQL that starter is

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,919
hitting the REST API and transforming it

00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,169
into integrety well if you Crocker well

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,999
lets you just make a graph QL query

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,679
directly to your WordPress site it is

00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:45,710
running its own it's like a completely

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,730
separate PR for the REST API so if you

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,649
really want to get us the great cool

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,830
side of things that is kind of the

00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:53,419
plugin to do right now I mentioned that

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,489
starter and theme is not exactly the

00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,869
same thing because a starter in Gatsby

00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:58,820
is kind of like create react app on the

00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:00,379
react side it's just a bunch of

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,509
boilerplate clothes code that you're

00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:04,190
gonna use that one time building on top

00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:06,379
of it and you're gonna fire up a whole

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,609
new one next time you start gasping I

00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:10,700
started working on what they're calling

00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:12,649
themes the idea that it's a starter but

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,869
it's also gonna have update capabilities

00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:16,070
you can use it across multiple sites it

00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:18,980
more in the way that we treat kind of

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,999
WordPress themes and on top of that is

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,840
that Gordon recently announced that

00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:24,080
they're starting

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,870
a project of porting a bunch of

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,380
WordPress themes in to Gatsby themes so

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,580
like 2019 this is a very exciting thing

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,039
it's still develop none of these are

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,289
actually released yet but it's something

00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,059
to absolutely watch not least which

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,559
because remember I said we're not really

00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:41,779
wanting to look at that WordPress site

00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,159
for the front end well if you're Gatsby

00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,679
theme matches up with your WordPress

00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,390
theme all of a sudden now you get you

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,409
can use WordPress preview and it's okay

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,580
if the kinda creators are just working

00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:52,370
on the WordPress side and you're just

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,279
working on the Gatsby side if if we can

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,409
have Gatsby themes that are running in

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,169
parallel with WordPress themes then

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:02,090
every time a wordpress theme becomes

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:03,980
popular that Gascony becomes popular and

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,789
that's now another tool you can use if

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,140
this building approach is useful for you

00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:13,460
so a lot of potential there but it's

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,200
still kind of growing I recommended

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,480
using your WordPress site on a subdomain

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,510
and your Gatsby app on the main domain

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,490
you're using what's actually probably

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,380
most fun if you're willing to get into

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,450
the weeds a little bit is having a mono

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,190
repo where you can run your WordPress

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,289
site is out of that same github repo but

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,990
you can then make use of your functions

00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:35,299
file and add plugins whatever to do Ajax

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,919
requested whatever you need to do and

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:38,630
have that available to you as a server

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,159
options you don't have to go to using

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,419
lambda functions or anything else if you

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,130
want that service I can be building you

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,990
have that server running and it's on

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,179
your domain and you can do that by just

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,049
hooking up your engine next to look at

00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:53,240
different ports that's a really fun way

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:54,470
to go about it but it requires some

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,570
management again on the hosting side the

00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,360
hosting side gets more complicated but

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,909
it pays dividends in the long run cool

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,950
that is my blazingly fast talk on

00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:06,020
blazingly fast freedom

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:10,750
yeah they blazingly fast questions we've

00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,750
got like five minutes yes

00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,870
so a bunch of so instead okay size

00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,030
generators for WordPress the idea being

00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,370
something like a simply static or jpg

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,570
static where you add a plug-in to your

00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,000
WordPress site and it will go through

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,020
and run that build step similarly where

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,760
it just says I'm gonna look at all my

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,860
category views all my tag views all my

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,510
author views all my posts and generate

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,780
static files and you can then push up

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:37,760
the reason why gatsby is cool is mostly

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,250
because of that react aspect it's the

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,740
idea of I want to do my layout in a

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:45,140
react style way and I want to manage my

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,210
files in that react style way it also on

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,560
top of it because that's because that's

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,880
where there's more of a developer

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,080
focused community on that side we're

00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,510
getting those really cool continuous

00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,950
integration tools there I'm not saying

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:59,090
there's not conduced integration tools

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,660
on those other static site plugins but

00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:05,320
they're not really moving as rapidly as

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:08,390
the gatsby system is in as much as

00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,520
there's a the whole concept of the

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,400
content mr. do gatsby community talks

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,890
about came about because this rapid

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,720
development tooling is happening it's

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,950
the guys we couldn't exist without the

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,990
fact that there is someone from mentum

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,360
behind these tools coming so that's what

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:26,210
makes it cool it that's why it's maybe

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,710
not the best fit for everybody if you're

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,510
especially if you're sitting here saying

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,280
I'm not a developer I don't want to do

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,960
react but I do like this performance

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
aspect absolutely a static site

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,690
generator that just runs out of the

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:43,300
plug-in is a really great way to go any

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,300
other questions yeah

00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,539
at mam once you get there still gonna be

00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,769
a scaling at that build step but all the

00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:21,910
more reason why that continues

00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,470
integration is kind of the way to go

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,269
because then you're letting a cloud

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,569
provider worry about that scaling

00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:30,099
problem but you know another reason why

00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,990
that's going from is less likely to cop

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:33,849
is it because of that graph QL notion of

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,140
we're only fetching exactly what we need

00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,250
so when I fetched that post I'm not

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,890
necessarily getting everything out of

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,750
the post the way that PHP is I'm getting

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,180
just its title just its content just a

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,289
scepter whatever exactly I need so I'm

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,000
not gonna say you're never gonna run

00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:47,799
into a scale problem but you're way less

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,319
likely to run into a scale problem for

00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:55,319
sure yeah yeah yeah

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,330
not necessarily with the starter what's

00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:09,770
the issues I run into a groomer now is

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:11,690
that because blocks are they are

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,990
rendering things way more complicated

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,210
than short codes ever did and short

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,000
codes themselves are still the problem

00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,050
so what you can imagine is when I'm

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,010
hitting that recipe and I'm trying to

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,020
get the content what I'm actually

00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,820
getting it is a bunch of HTML which

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,800
might include short code watch where I

00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,650
include some asynchronously loaded

00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,270
JavaScript tag you know all that stuff

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,730
now when I'm running that through

00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:38,840
dangerously set HTML in my react

00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,970
template it's just stuck there right so

00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,910
it it now puts the onus on me that if my

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,410
content creator wants to use a block or

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,900
a shortcode or anything in that

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,420
Gutenberg's give me that isn't just the

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,550
content is now on me to make sure that

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,060
I'm transforming that or giving them

00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,440
some other way to do that and honestly

00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,830
what I've ended up doing is basically

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,720
getting just not using the blocks as

00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,310
they are but then providing meta fields

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,080
or creating a block of that is

00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,620
essentially just meta fields so as

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,240
opposed to like say no embed of a tweet

00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,120
rather than using the OL embed Blachford

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,550
for Twitter you know still getting the

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,950
URL for the tweet and then I'll render

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,390
out the tweet through my build step that

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,310
sort of thing and so puts a lot of onus

00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,660
on me as a developer right but I'm still

00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:27,920
giving them the way to embed the tweaked

00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,990
yeah so that's the unfortunate side

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,580
right yes I don't it's not I'm not

00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,560
seeing anything where Gutenberg itself

00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,080
is inherently conflicting it's only the

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,410
matter of the same content issue that is

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,690
there always is still going to be there

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,860
now I'm a I should say also the thing

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,980
where Gooden Burt does maybe throw off

00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,630
is because it becomes harder or at least

00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,890
I haven't seen any of those deployed

00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,560
plugins that are trying to like watch

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:54,620
for a safe because of the autosave stuff

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,670
which is before Gutenberg even what is

00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,720
really getting that ripe I think it's

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,920
because a lot of people doing these

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,000
guest people play plugins are not

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,220
actually WordPress people that got

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,960
people trying to make something for it

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,800
myself included I've not done this right

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,090
very well that that's been hard but I'll

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,900
take full blame for that as well because

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,580
I'm part of people trying to fix that

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,790
so that's that's the one thing I have

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,790
