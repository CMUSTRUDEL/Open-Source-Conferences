Description: 
	GatsbyJS has become quite the darling in front-end web development. It runs off popular new technology like React, Webpack, and GraphQL. It generates blazingly fast static sites that are cheap to host and scale. You can use it to make a quick website or an intricate web application. But most importantly it works with almost any data source out there. Enter WordPress from stage left.
WordPress lets the modern developer provide the intuitive, customizable back-end experience that content creators love to use. Headless WordPress provides that same experience while allowing for any front-end development of choice. For your efforts making these ends meet, your visitors are rewarded with sites that load quickly and have the same content awareness they expect from a WordPress site.
