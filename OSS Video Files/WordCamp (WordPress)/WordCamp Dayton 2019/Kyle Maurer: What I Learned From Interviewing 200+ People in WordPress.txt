Title: Kyle Maurer: What I Learned From Interviewing 200+ People in WordPress
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	Over the past five years, I’ve been running a weekly interview show featuring a new guest from the WordPress community every episode. I’ve learned a lot about the people who make up this community. I want to share the reflections I’ve gleaned from listening to the people who use and make WordPress.

okay all right let's roll my friends

00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,600
thank you all for joining me and thank

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,090
you for coming to work camp Dayton this

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,880
is a wonderful event first time I

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,460
attended here was like five years ago

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,199
and it's been a special part of every

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,300
year since about five years ago I was

00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:36,370
starting to get involved in WordPress in

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,550
a few different ways and I was kind of

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,760
catching the bug as a lot of us have and

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,469
I was making some plugins and releasing

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,050
them for free I was helping to organize

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:49,420
a meet-up up in Jackson Michigan where

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,069
I'm from and attending my first few word

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,019
camps and kind of getting hooked

00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:55,269
thinking like this is this is a really

00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:57,460
cool vibe I love the culture of this

00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:59,469
this community that I'm stumbling across

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,239
I love the information that's being

00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,159
shared and some of these people seem

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,360
like I can learn a lot from a lot of

00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,840
cool stuff going on and I was kind of

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,990
getting interested in doing more and

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,170
finding new new ways to find my place or

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,630
participate in this community and on

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,909
Google+ of all places I stumbled across

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,520
someone saying they wanted to start a

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,170
wordpress show and they were looking for

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
co-hosts I didn't know the person but I

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,670
said hey maybe that's the thing for me

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,020
I'm comfortable speaking and pretending

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,060
like I know something even though I

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,490
don't and so the next thing you know I

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,359
found myself co-hosting the wp

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:40,179
roundtable show back in early 2014 with

00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:44,829
a couple strangers now over the next

00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:46,179
five years I have continued co-hosting

00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:48,729
this show with along with a revolving

00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,259
door of no less than ten co-hosts for

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,130
the past couple years has really been

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:56,530
just me and I have somehow persuaded

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,070
around 200 different people who work in

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,350
the industry to come on my show and and

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,630
talk about what it is they do and their

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:08,020
stories and what success means to them

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,630
and all that fun stuff along the way I

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,940
learned a lot of different things and it

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,860
and it's this is a fun opportunity for

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,330
me to begin to share a little bit of my

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,110
reflections just looking back on this

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,660
time getting to

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,630
with I think are the brightest minds in

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,390
the industry learned a handful of things

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,120
about what they've done and what their

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,830
lessons were when it came to succeeding

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,560
a lot of people I talk to have been very

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,620
successful at what they've done I

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,010
learned a little bit about the makeup of

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,840
this industry who's working in WordPress

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,390
who's actually doing stuff with it and

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,530
moving things on the web these days and

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,390
I also learned a little bit about myself

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,350
and what it takes to run a successful

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,240
side project

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,950
if you're curious who these people are

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,470
here's a list of all their names

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,330
some of them might look familiar a

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,270
handful of them or even in this room

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,489
right now I've interviewed a lot of a

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,530
lot of people and these these are very

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,209
special people I'm very excited about

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,860
this list feel very privileged to have

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,480
had an opportunity to talk one on one

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,040
with this many amazing minds but don't

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,560
feel bad if these names mean nothing to

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,420
you maybe these brands do because these

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,100
are some of the brands represented by

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,040
the companies who I have had the

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:27,040
privilege of talking to at length this

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,400
should give us a little bit of context I

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,890
guess to understand like who these

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,380
people are that we're talking about now

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,840
let's start let's start first with some

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,670
of the reflections that I have about

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,709
about me looking back how was I able to

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,950
do this so consistently and and what did

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,590
I learn about myself in the process a

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,780
lot of things maybe the most significant

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,580
is what it feels like to regret

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,930
experimenting with so many different

00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,910
hairstyles over the years way too many

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,950
anyway story time the other day I went

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:08,620
into my favorite coffee shop back home

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:14,709
and the barista said morning Kyle the

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:17,019
usual and I was like this because like

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,880
achievement unlocked right I couldn't

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,010
wait to get home and tell my wife about

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,780
how awesome it was that I went the same

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,250
place enough times in order the same

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,940
thing that someone said the usual Kyle

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,250
that's great that is

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,950
that sense of familiarity is something

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,270
that I appreciate and I think everyone

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,910
else I think you could relate to that

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,770
like we love that familiarity feeling we

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,490
all love to feel like we're in cheers

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,380
everywhere we go except more often than

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,120
not it feels more like first day at a

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,800
new high school everywhere we go

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,990
some of you may be feeling like that in

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
this room right now feeling maybe a

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,980
little intimidated a little out of place

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,660
a little like everybody else knows each

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,480
other everybody else knows more than me

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,250
blah blah blah I can relate to that

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,010
feeling I felt that for a long time it

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,520
still do to some extent and so I know I

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,280
know what it's like and how difficult it

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,380
can be to overcome it reminds me of how

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,810
proto must have felt at the Council of

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,310
Elrond you know it's a beautiful scene

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:23,630
of course where we're a hobbit of all

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,490
creatures is sitting amongst like lords

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,650
and heroes and literal living legends

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,840
and and the conversation is way above

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,970
his head and paygrade and doesn't

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,830
understand what's going on and feels so

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,540
out of place and we feel that way all

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,790
the time

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,910
so in this this journey of getting to

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,310
talk with a lot of brilliant people I

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,100
learned an important lesson about the

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,830
fact that there is actually a place for

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,010
me there are things that I'm capable of

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,290
doing and there's there's a spot that I

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,390
can fill and I just have to be

00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,950
persistent and find it I think that's

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,050
the case for all of us we can all kind

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,790
of find our place our role to play

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,490
they'll have something unique and

00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,669
special in some way and this really has

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,130
helped me find that I've had to come to

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,200
appreciate that I am unique and

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,910
different than everyone else I am NOT

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,700
I'm not Chris lemon or Matt Mullenweg

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm not carried ills Rebecca rice there

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,820
am NOT people Williamson I'm not Steve

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,000
Grunwald or Adam silver or Dustin

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,410
Hartzler

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,860
I am

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm Kyle that's it and I've got a few

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,180
little things that I can do in the place

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,820
that I live and with the people that I

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,570
know and there's a place for me that I

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,620
can I can flourish in and I think that's

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,200
the case for everybody else and I

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,480
encourage you to embark on that journey

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,850
and find your place I also learned a

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,580
little bit about what it takes to

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,870
sustain a project like I have started

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,370
more side projects than well it's been a

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,140
lot of side projects so I've forgotten

00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,270
about more side projects that I started

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,050
then then a lot of people start in their

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,610
life and this is one little side project

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,840
lifts for some reason when I look back

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,670
on it the biggest thing that stands out

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,090
to me is like how on earth that I just

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:14,030
did I keep doing it and I not give up or

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,260
stop like I did with all the other side

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,890
projects I started well I think it's I

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,360
learned a little lesson about

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:25,970
strategically tricking yourself into a

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,010
situation where it's really difficult to

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,450
cancel on your commitments and I saw

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,880
every a couple months like I scheduled

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,790
all my guests for four months in advance

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,830
and I put that on the calendar at a

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,270
specific time and my family's on board

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,810
that that's the time that I do this

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,720
every single week and it's very awkward

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,720
and difficult for me to cancel that and

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,900
that's enough of a trick for me to still

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,690
be doing it five years later silly well

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,640
heck I suppose I also look back and

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,160
appreciate that my audience is a huge

00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,660
this show is relatively unknown despite

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
the fact that I've been doing it for so

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,770
long and that I've talked to like all

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,950
the notable people in the industry

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,440
really even in spite of that no one

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,480
knows about it and few people really

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,980
even tuned in relative to a lot of the

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,930
other cool shows in the industry that

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,060
are a little bit more polished I've

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,300
learned

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,710
value of polishing things and putting in

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,410
a little bit extra effort to make it

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,340
good and to market it but I also know

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,520
that one thing that I did do even though

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,260
maybe I didn't make it the most

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,550
presentable and marking it really hard I

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,770
did release stuff I made things that are

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,040
out there now and I did that

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,630
consistently for years and if I had in

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,130
one hand something that was beautiful

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,450
and polished that anybody could

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,650
objectively be proud of it on the other

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,720
hand things that were actually released

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,450
to the world I had to take that every

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,320
day of the week but at the same time I

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,870
have learned to appreciate that making

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,270
compromises in quality do limit my

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,890
growth potential if I spent a little bit

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,410
more time on this project I would have a

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,790
bigger audience thing is I don't care

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,990
that much about that it's not what's

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,030
about for me so I don't I look back at

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,970
what I thought I was gonna get out of

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,710
this in the beginning compared to what I

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,140
actually did in the end I had some

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,570
expectations and some hopes I invest in

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,020
this here's what I think the outcome

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,110
might be

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,330
I was quite mistaken but I'm not

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:33,770
dejected over this reality I am actually

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:36,050
very pleased with this and please in the

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,550
end because I wouldn't take what's on

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,650
this side of the screen any day as well

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,900
I'm much more satisfied with these

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,490
results I find these things to be much

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,490
more valuable and enriching to my life

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,090
let's talk now about the makeup of this

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,420
WordPress community these are these are

00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,790
my reflections on just who the people

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,380
are what aren't their profiles what do

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,480
they like and interested in and and

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,030
where they from and their backgrounds

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,850
and all that with the disclaimer of

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:15,440
course that my network is large relative

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,580
to a lot of people's in this particular

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,860
industry and yet it's still microscopic

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,440
relative to the global industry my

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:29,470
network is a reflection of me and my

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,240
characteristics and life and so being a

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,570
white male 30-something in Middle

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,970
America my network really reflects that

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,400
the kind of events that I attend and

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,590
parties that I go to and discussions I

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,200
engage in and people who are introduced

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,550
to me and so on reflect the

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,650
characteristics that I have in the

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,630
places that I go and so my network is

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,610
not as diverse as the global community

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,900
is though I'm working hard on fixing

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,340
that problem even so even with this

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,580
disclaimer I think that there are some

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,940
noteworthy observations to make and

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:11,060
reflections to discuss first we are in a

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,380
young industry and I'm not talking about

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,060
the age of the people in the industry

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,590
we'll get to that momentarily I'm

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,010
talking about the age of the industry

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:22,400
itself this industry has not been around

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,580
a long time but it is beginning to

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,340
mature we're seeing the first signs of

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,290
real maturation in this market now all

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:35,960
industries follow a very similar

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:38,090
trajectory all of them begin moving

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,330
through this highly fractured phase

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:44,930
where the industry is made up of a

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,850
tremendous number of small players we're

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,820
talking about lots and lots and lots of

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,370
micro companies all doing very similar

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,410
or even exactly the same thing that's

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,720
kind of like what our industry looks

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,610
like right now we have tons of designers

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,970
and developers and product makers with

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,730
small single digit number teams

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,890
tons in this industry but the market is

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,020
beginning to mature and we're beginning

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,330
to see some signs of consolidation

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,740
consolidation occurs in every industry

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:17,080
over time when eventually what occurs is

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,490
those small companies start to get a

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,260
little bit bigger and the next thing you

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,330
know some of them are maybe merging with

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,400
or acquiring other companies or putting

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,500
their competitors out of business and so

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,720
gradually there are a smaller number of

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,390
players and those existing players are

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,910
much bigger than any were previously and

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,090
new entrance to the market are finding

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,290
the barrier to entry much greater harder

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,540
to start a new business and be

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,410
competitive because it's a little bit

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,150
more dominated by large players with

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,730
more resources and that are more deeply

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,800
entrenched and so eventually we get way

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,600
up on this chart to a point where there

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,000
are a very small number of players just

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,340
huge corporations dominating it and the

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,730
entire industry is employed by just

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,020
those two players I'm sure we can think

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,610
of lots of industries that are like that

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,190
there are very mature and established

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,070
and are highly consolidated and there's

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,900
only there are very very very few like

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,580
small entrepreneurs running scrappy

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:18,730
small teams trying to the Giants that's

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,290
uh that's not the case with WordPress

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,090
right now we're still highly fractured

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,520
with tons of small companies but we are

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,230
seeing it begin to be a lot harder to

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,300
enter the market than it used to be and

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,580
become competitive like new entrants

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:35,100
people's getting started are now more

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,100
commonly like taking funding or like

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,890
starting like new ventures with big

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,930
teams or new divisions of bigger

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,030
companies are the new entrants as

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,830
opposed to like just somebody throwing

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,450
together some code on the weekend and a

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,610
logo and calling themselves a business

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,230
that still happens a little bit but it's

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,390
getting a little more difficult the

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,310
market is more competitor and if you do

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,800
so you're going head-to-head with teams

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,800
of 50 or 100 or 500 people

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,490
this is a signal that the market is

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,420
still young this is these are the guests

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,610
that I talked to and the percentage of

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,980
them who are self-employed versus

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,769
employed by a company now in a young

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,410
highly fractured industry like WordPress

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,990
we see the pink side being much bigger a

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,110
lot of people are self-employed in this

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,279
industry that's still the case probably

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,380
more than half of the people in this

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,029
room are self-employed I wouldn't have a

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,620
guess that's that's a distinct

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,800
possibility it could be wrong maybe it's

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,410
close to have but in a highly mature

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,540
much more consolidated industry the

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,649
white side will be much much larger and

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,690
there will be very very few

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,370
self-employed people we're not there yet

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,399
but that is the direction that we're

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,399
going

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,320
this shouldn't really surprise anybody

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,170
I've been told repeatedly over and over

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,290
and over this myself seen signs that the

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,000
WordPress community is actually doing

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,230
pretty good and very open-minded and

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,690
very committed to commit correcting this

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,610
like gender gap and diversity gaps that

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,589
we experience in tech very

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,709
forward-thinking and trying to do things

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,589
actively to promote diversity and to

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,769
help with this problem but there's still

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,779
a tremendous way to go we're still out

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:30,670
there we're actually not even close

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:35,079
but generally we're all doing our best

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,120
to correct it and I'm optimistic about

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,709
the future there's still a lot of work

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,250
that needs to be done this is the makeup

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:44,110
of my guests which I look at this and

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,230
I'm quite disappointed no I have tried

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,540
I've tried and I continue to try harder

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,640
and harder to work on this and to

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,209
increase the diversity and my personal

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,160
network and and a guests on my show this

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,149
is this is maybe the best that I can do

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,149
in the first five years

00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:11,120
turnover is a big deal this industry is

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,399
young it is volatile there are a lot of

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,860
businesses coming and going there are a

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,860
lot of young people employed in the

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,420
industry who are not established in

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,680
their careers and are changing jobs

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,649
quickly and so I see a high percentage

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:33,079
of people changing jobs and moving on to

00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:36,079
something new all the time we see

00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,430
definitely big age gaps now this one I

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,350
think is a little interesting there are

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,610
a couple there are a couple things that

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,709
I have come up with upon reflection of

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,779
this chart as you can see the

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:51,019
overwhelming majority of the people on

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:54,769
my show have been in their 30s my age

00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:57,529
group no the first the first factor I

00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:59,269
think is these were people invited by me

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,069
which is means there were people that I

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,839
met and became acquainted with because I

00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,990
never invite strangers on the show it's

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,780
only people that I've met and

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,400
unsurprised jority of the people that I

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,429
end up a meeting and interacting with

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,350
sir social means are in a similar age

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:17,809
group to me they're attending the same

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,610
functions they're sharing and similar

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,699
interests engaging in same discussions

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:27,110
that I am and what do you know they're

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:29,000
similar age to me so that is one reason

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,500
why I think this is large there are a

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,580
couple of other reasons that aren't me

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,530
specific one is the age of the

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,000
technology I think contributes to this a

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:45,789
little bit WordPress is still a little

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,610
bit too new to be dominating or really

00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:52,970
really penetrating the enterprise market

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:57,820
so like big businesses people more

00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:01,580
entrenched in their careers it's not as

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,289
prevalent there but at the same time or

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,700
press is kind of old and it's not the

00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,090
hot new thing that the kids are doing

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,850
any longer

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,910
and so there's this middle age group

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:16,050
that is still really passionate about

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:18,120
WordPress that a lot of us started using

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,730
WordPress when it actually was the hip

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,410
new thing when we were in our 20s when

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,090
we were the young kids trying out the

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,250
new things and we were the the people

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,800
who could afford to risk playing around

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,020
with new technologies and just seeing

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,520
what we like and making a decision about

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,810
what to go with because we were getting

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:41,130
started as opposed to being established

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:42,990
so that stage in our careers impacts the

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,730
tech knowledge of the week technology

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,830
that we end up using so it's not

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,530
surprising to me that a lot of us in

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,970
kind of this getting close to the middle

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,250
of our career but still in the early

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,290
half of our career are the ones really

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,380
leaning on WordPress and the third

00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:02,850
reason why I think that this this slice

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,310
of the pie is so dominant is I think our

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,500
age group is very disproportionately

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,720
represented at conferences at least the

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,230
conference's that I attend now this age

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:19,980
group is one where us people like myself

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:23,310
are not are commonly not so settled in

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:27,200
to a life which restricts us from

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:30,570
traveling at our leisure I am capable of

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,480
going anywhere that I want you really

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,730
almost anytime I can attend a lot of

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,030
events I'm not really like settled and

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,090
locked in and and and changed to home

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:45,420
and I have the youthful energy to do so

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,580
as much as I like but I also am old

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,560
enough that I have that independence and

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,110
the financial means to do so which the

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,750
younger crowd does it quite yet maybe

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,270
still in college maybe not having the

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,790
financial resources yet or the

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,460
independence to take off for conferences

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,690
so my age group is very well represented

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,270
at conferences because of just these

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,360
life situations and that those are the

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:13,420
three reasons that I believe this age

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,650
group is dominant in my network and on

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,650
guess so that I've had on my show

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,890
yeah so I live in the US and I haven't

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,290
travel much outside the US so my network

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,970
it's not very big

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,720
outside of the US this is a map of my

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,360
guests that's kind of fun to make I've

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,010
got a ways to go I've got a lot of a lot

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,020
of networking outside of this country to

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:44,140
do and the WordPress community is global

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,679
I think the u.s. is disproportionately

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:51,309
represented anywhere you go throughout

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,230
WordPress the spotlight is always on the

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,750
American developers contributing and the

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,840
American companies moving and shaking

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,179
the industry even though there are just

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,640
as many or more great people doing

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:05,350
things outside of the US they don't get

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,350
the same level of attention or

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,450
appreciation that's like that's that's

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,130
for sure

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,710
there's a little map of this is not very

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,950
meaningful for reflections or anything

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,049
this is just I made a map and I say yeah

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,030
look at that look at that I put pins on

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:24,280
a map of oh my guess there's no takeaway

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,990
from this then I've been getting around

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,059
this country a little bit meeting the

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,919
WordPress community it's pretty exciting

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,799
there are a lot of great communities

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,950
around here I very am very fond of the

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,510
Ohio WordPress community a lot of great

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,030
a lot of great stuff happening and

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,559
Dayton Columbus Northeast Ohio

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,390
all over the place Pittsburgh has a

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,919
really good community a lot of cool

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,650
stuff happening in California and

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,220
Florida but the greatest is in Michigan

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,220
of course

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,330
I want to reflect a little bit WordPress

00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:59,029
is having its sweet 16 this year

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:02,210
actually and if we were to really break

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,759
up the years that WordPress has been

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,519
around into four year chunks we could

00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,759
for fun call each of those four year

00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,460
trunks in era and I want to share some

00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,440
reflections on each of those eras now

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,419
these are reflections based on not just

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,549
my conversations with all of these

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,259
guests and I've talked to some from each

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:26,629
era at length but also from my extensive

00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:29,149
research and and just reading the

00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:31,759
history of this project in this

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:40,759
community and being there for a lot of

00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:42,559
it the the first class is the smallest

00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,649
that's the first thing to say about it

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,299
and it says it was small and it's

00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,340
difficult to find a guest for my show

00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,929
from this class because it's such a

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,659
small group this is long before

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:56,059
WordPress was dominating and market

00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:58,970
share and it was a household name it was

00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:02,330
it was just this new player it was small

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,580
and it rose quickly but still at this

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,639
stage it was one of many options for

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,159
powering your blog and so there weren't

00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:14,749
you know a tremendous number of people

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,309
using it also due to attrition there are

00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:19,039
a lot of people who are very active in

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,769
the WordPress scene back then who are no

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,960
longer using it this is a long time ago

00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:26,210
so in this stage it's a little bit

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,279
difficult to really find a whole lot of

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,049
people who were truly active and

00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:32,210
participating in the WordPress project

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,889
during this stage but it was an

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,379
interesting time there was just a lot of

00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:38,509
excitement there's a lot of kind of

00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:39,950
maybe younger people like I was talking

00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,539
about trying out new things

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,970
experimenting with different

00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:45,919
technologies pushing the limits of

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,330
different platforms and trying out all

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,279
of them and trying to extend them and

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,659
hack away at the code and people like

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,490
Matt Mullenweg himself one of the

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,710
cofounders of the project you know just

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,200
like a young blogger and hacker and

00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,899
playing around with code and next thing

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,320
you know it's kind of popular and it's

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:04,730
becoming a focus and an open source was

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,870
just like a really passionate

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,720
idea that they all held true to the next

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:14,030
class things started to get a little bit

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,710
interesting because the project Rosen

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,830
popularity beyond the expectations of

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,049
really anybody and this is when

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,690
monetization of a WordPress really

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,450
started to become a commonplace though

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,030
it was a contentious issue how do we

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,760
monetize anything we're doing here is it

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,190
okay to sell any software that we make

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,740
is it okay to sell a theme or a plugin

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:41,690
that was a very heated argument during

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,910
this era and we saw the first beginnings

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,190
of a community start to formalize the

00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:49,610
first word camps took place it's

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,290
starting to expand through word of mouth

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,419
this is the era also where WordPress

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,340
kind of like chopped the market share

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,470
and became like significantly larger

00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:01,130
than Drupal or Joomla or all the other

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:05,480
players and it's being recognized as an

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:08,840
important tool and this is where a lot

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,490
of theme creators or suddenly making a

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:16,160
whole lot more money than they expected

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:18,500
to selling some games the following era

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,910
and at the earth at the beginning of

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,770
this is when I really started actively

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,290
participating in WordPress in like early

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,650
2011 so I'm still kind of new to the

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:30,140
scene I I think this is when we really

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,290
saw the the community exploding and

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,570
sighs this is where WordPress started to

00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,970
just dominate the market share became

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,190
the undisputed leader having more web

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:44,419
sites than like all the next three

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:46,580
competitors combined plug this is also

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:48,410
an era where a number of prominent

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,660
companies like whoo themes and and

00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,280
elegant themes and I themes went from

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,750
like being a theme focused company to a

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,350
plug-in focused company and plugins

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,360
started to be the hot thing to sell as a

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,059
bit of an interesting time the software

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,850
itself began to mature and turn into a

00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:07,220
content management system as opposed to

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,020
a blogging platform and spend this era

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:14,500
really battling that image that it had

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:18,500
from the early days and then the most

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,150
recent years have also been interesting

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,920
because this is really the era where

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,950
WordPress is kind of like going into

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,870
uncharted territory this it's especially

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,360
for a content management system like

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:32,420
none of them have ever done this before

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,650
or gone here or achieve this level of

00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:39,770
success or evolved this many years it's

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,200
it's it feels very new like we're going

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,060
where no platform has gone before and

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,540
this is the era where we start to call

00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,820
WordPress a platform instead of like a

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,100
blogging tool or a content management

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,440
system now WordPress is being used for

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,420
weird stuff nobody predicted crazy

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,100
things Steve is probably building absurd

00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,600
things with WordPress that nobody is

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,240
nobody would have been envisioned five

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,090
years ago crazy things but it can't even

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,040
talk about I'm sure now we're seeing

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,500
like I talked about before the market is

00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,810
maturing and we're seeing like

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,640
legitimate companies form that are

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,850
employing a lot of people and making

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,210
real money and taking funding from

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,630
venture capitalists and getting acquired

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,370
from major corporations and that's

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,140
suddenly like major companies I'm

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,550
talking like Microsoft and Google aren't

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,070
paying attention to WordPress and

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,900
investing in the scene this was unheard

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:37,310
of before when it was this funny little

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,620
niche and it's also much more

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:42,020
competitive than it ever was before we

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,970
saw in the previous era actually the the

00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,470
era before this was the first time we're

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,540
competitive competition started to be a

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,980
real thing where instead of like there

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,930
was one for plug in there was one

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,730
e-commerce tool you know there was one

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,520
membership solution for this through

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,400
that then suddenly there were three now

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,110
there's a dozen of each and it's highly

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,240
competitive and starting one is a major

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:08,600
undertaking and you're going against the

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:11,000
big boys and girls now back to just some

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,290
general observations about we're still

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,020
on the people and the makeup of this

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,980
community a little bit even though I

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,310
sidetracked I just want to talk a little

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,140
bit about history this is one of the

00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,820
more cliche things that I hear from

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,940
every guest as though like they're the

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,250
first to say it except they're not

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,380
everybody says you know it's kind of

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,679
funny story I got into the accident you

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:36,309
know okay cute except every single guest

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,779
said that that's not surprising this is

00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:39,159
a young industry it's not like your

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,330
career counselors at college we're

00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:41,980
saying I'm gonna put you into the

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,210
WordPress track you know that's that

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,309
sounds like the right thing for you it's

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,899
not established that's not a thing all

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,580
right anybody who's working in this

00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,950
industry kind of like stumbled into it

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:55,240
as it's sort of like exploded

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,950
unexpectedly and most everyone has a

00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,529
college education the majority of the

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,399
people that I talk to a lot of them had

00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:04,990
really crazy unrelated careers and like

00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,539
them you know the military or a

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,190
firefighter or living out of their car

00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,529
or something weird

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,940
I heard repeatedly I don't know what to

00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:14,200
take away from this but there's a lot of

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,840
people that I talked to have been

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,250
successful in WordPress who are saying

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,590
things to me like I'm a little burned

00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,590
out on travel I was you know in the

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,480
previous era going to like every other

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,029
work camp you know when in the world

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,649
there were 20 and I was trying to go to

00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,009
all of them and now there's like a

00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:34,769
hundred and I don't even know how many

00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:38,529
125 probably probably more than that

00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:40,149
globally and so I heard a lot of these

00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,419
successful people who say like I'm kind

00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:45,700
of scaling back a little bit but they're

00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,990
also getting to that age group like a

00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,529
lot of the people that I talked about

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,769
before we're at a point where they were

00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:55,960
they were younger and free to just wow

00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,269
this thing's taking off I made this

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,629
goofy theme on a weekend it's suddenly

00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:04,330
I'm making five figures in a month and I

00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:07,659
never expected this so I'm going to quit

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,039
my silly day job and just like hop

00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:10,539
around to these work camps across the

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,039
country like it's not an uncommon

00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:17,470
uncommon story from that era ever like I

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,970
said everyone was self-taught nobody had

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:23,830
formal training for any that's hardly

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:26,139
any hardly anybody and this is a note

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,299
for a significant number of people I

00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:31,629
heard this over and over this became a

00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:34,240
broken record the first work camp was a

00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,580
major turning point and as this was the

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,649
case for me as well I'm no exception

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,350
first time I went I was like what is

00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:43,480
this this is crazy people are just like

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,460
sharing this information people are

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,799
coming to me and be like how can I help

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,200
you you know what can I do to make your

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,090
life easier or to fix your websites and

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,370
I was heaven nothing but problems that I

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,080
need to solve and I was shocked I come

00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,929
from a business school background where

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,610
I was like that's not how it works

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,019
we're supposed to be competing against

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,029
each other and trade - just like subvert

00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:06,159
the other and like beat you and trick

00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,360
you and and and show the public how you

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,059
suck and I'm great

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,409
like it dog-eat-dog world right I was

00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,090
very young naive but that was my

00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,590
business school training and when I came

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,419
into this community where it was like

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:20,559
whatever let's just help each other out

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:23,230
I was like you know the clouds parted

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,120
and angels sung and I said I'm never

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:30,639
leaving this like this is beautiful I'm

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:33,039
here for life let's move on to some of

00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:36,370
the lessons that people exchanged with

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,659
me or they I learned other explicitly

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:42,760
from them telling me the guests or

00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:46,750
implicitly just like me interpreting

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:50,830
their stories advice that they told me

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,389
over and over the jack-of-all-trades

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,070
kind of going out of style very

00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:56,679
difficult to market a jack-of-all-trades

00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:00,190
but a specialist someone is actually

00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,019
like really good at anything it's really

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,289
easy to mark it really easy to employ

00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:07,570
and really easy to pay top dollar so

00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,250
specialized when you can it's a little

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,230
bit difficult I really even see myself

00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,000
for a while and I found and I can

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,899
appreciate how hard it can be to start

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,019
like saying we offer a dozen things

00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:22,509
now we're gonna only offer six things

00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:24,549
and let go and if somebody asks for

00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:26,679
those other things we're gonna say no we

00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,799
don't do that and that was really hard

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,990
and it felt unnatural and the result

00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,509
it's quite surprising that this actually

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,250
helps your business suddenly I'm able to

00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:38,159
charge more I'm getting more customers

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,389
and closing them at a higher rate

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,450
everything is going much better because

00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:46,540
I stopped offering more things this was

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:49,870
a advice so not just for my guests but

00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,610
for me as well everybody keeps saying

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,220
raising prices raising prices raising

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,470
prices over and over broken record but a

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,910
lot of credence to that I think it's

00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,950
smart I think it's smart I think the

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:06,310
majority of us are not charging quite

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:07,630
enough people said like I talked a

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,170
little bit about before there's

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,090
incredible and releasing things to the

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,000
world I heard a lot of stories about

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:20,500
people who waited too long to release

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,900
something or we're a little bit too too

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,240
cautious or too nervous about sharing it

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,890
with the world or overcome with that

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,720
impostor syndrome like whatever I make

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,360
isn't isn't going to be good enough but

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,710
the people who ship things even though

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,030
they were crappy and today they're

00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,880
embarrassed about those early iterations

00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:41,620
they shipped it and iterated often and

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,330
if that is the model that succeeds I

00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,180
heard good advice from a lot of people

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:49,780
about understanding when something's not

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:52,570
working and when it's time to pivot or

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,750
move on to something different this is a

00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:57,280
valuable skill and the people who are

00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,040
most successful we're not the ones who

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:04,420
just normally persisted indefinitely

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:06,970
they were the people who gave everything

00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:10,210
their best shot and worked super super

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:14,080
hard and when things weren't working

00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:16,710
they learned from what they tried took

00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,410
all of that experience as though it were

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,640
wealth and that they had amassed and

00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:23,260
invested it into a new thing where they

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,480
were much better off than last there's

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,370
no such thing as like stepping back and

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,470
starting from scratch because along the

00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:33,120
way you've accumulated a whole lot of

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:36,310
knowledge and entered talent and

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,740
connections and you're not starting back

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,510
where you were before you've still moved

00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,360
forward

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,830
everybody has stories I was asked about

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,230
like what's a horse story like worst

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,890
client project and issues with employees

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,350
and bosses and so on and everybody says

00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,940
something to the effect of if if the

00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,170
communication is good I think there's

00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:02,040
almost no problem you can't

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:05,010
over communicates and stuff engaging the

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,040
community is absolutely a like fast

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,720
track to success my phone stopped

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,210
ringing from clients when I stay at home

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,950
and live like a hermit and so my

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,920
business suffered but not just I'm just

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,869
business but everything relating to my

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,180
work and my life and my satisfaction

00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:24,390
with my job was enhanced and enriched

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,730
when I left home and participated in a

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,680
community like this and also embraced

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,050
this culture of like giving it first

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,050
don't approach any situation thinking

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,599
like what can I get out of this but like

00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,300
what can I add what can I provide and

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,220
help others much like what Steve so well

00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,990
put this morning trying to help others

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,220
good job Steve I'm like I'm on fire

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:50,130
because of you these are these are more

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,200
me interpreting like the factors that I

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:57,329
think were present in some of the

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,220
stories that were really successful some

00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,109
of them were just right place right time

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,380
no denying they'd be the first to admit

00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,799
it

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:08,760
you can't copy some of the people who

00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:11,040
you model yourself after because they

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,440
were working in a different time there

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,109
is no doubt that WordPress is like

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,559
success and market share was like so

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:22,380
fast and unprecedented that a lot of

00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:25,319
people who were no more talented than

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,630
you or more experienced in fact probably

00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:31,950
less so we're throwing together little

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:35,369
things and shocked shocked to discover

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,450
that they were selling like crazy there

00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:38,369
are a lot of people who are just doing

00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,530
the right thing at the right time and it

00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:42,089
became successful as a result and so

00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,980
this is something to remind yourself of

00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:48,319
if your project hasn't taken off and

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,319
you're not prospering like so and so did

00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,880
the industry is a little bit different

00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,890
now

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,839
you can't copy what they did because the

00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:00,690
situation is not a lot of them failed

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,790
over and over repeatedly and it was just

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,220
the last thing that they did they really

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,750
took off so if you talk to all kinds of

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,349
these people like the founders of the

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,509
these huge hosting

00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:12,880
these who are incredibly successful

00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:15,970
right now those are the folks who like

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,430
tried thing after thing after thing and

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:21,099
they just flopped and fell in their face

00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,519
her stories through my interviews from

00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:26,489
people who were like at rock-bottom

00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,420
multiple times living in their car

00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:31,749
nothing's going right

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,269
and somehow fast forward the tape years

00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:38,619
later and they're sitting on top of the

00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:41,700
mountain and they will tell their

00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:44,739
stories much better but the truth is

00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,720
none of them were one-hit wonders and

00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:49,059
talk to anybody like that there's like

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,630
first thing exploded I've talked to a

00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:55,319
lot of people look back and see a track

00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:58,779
record of more failures than successes

00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:01,269
and that's not the picture that we see

00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:03,640
when we look at them we see their

00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:05,920
successes but they look back and they

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,509
just see a trail of wreckage behind them

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:14,799
a lot of people have fun success just

00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:16,900
had money you know simple is that some

00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:19,630
of them were fortunate enough to be in a

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,430
situation where they could just take

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,859
time off and not earn a paycheck and

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,239
just invest in a project who knows what

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:28,059
their situation was they were all

00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,450
different maybe they just had a lot left

00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:33,609
over from a previous job or took a an

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,170
offer from a company or sold something

00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,529
or just whatever they could just sit

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:41,349
back and make no money for a year or

00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:43,569
years and work on something and most of

00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:44,739
us don't have that luxury so some of

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,460
them were successful just cuz they had

00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,440
that privilege

00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,749
some of us successful because they took

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,009
VC money and built a big project and

00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:53,529
hire an incredible team who most

00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:55,569
talented designers and developers in the

00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:58,390
industry and that took off these are

00:38:55,569 --> 00:39:00,339
just factors there are realities behind

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:04,089
some of the brands that you look and see

00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:05,619
prospering a lot of them found their

00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:07,539
success from the people that they

00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,400
connected with and so many of those

00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:11,019
connections are made at events like this

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,229
we're sitting next to someone who has a

00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:17,079
lot in common with you and discover

00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:20,410
maybe your paths maybe your trajectories

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,630
are like aligned and a lot of the really

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,940
successful companies and

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,980
that I've talked to it all started when

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,160
they met the right person who wanted to

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:33,030
go the same place with them and and just

00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,220
things took off from there and lastly of

00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,510
course you just work their butts off I'm

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,340
talking to people who just work late at

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,440
night worked over the weekend made the

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,580
big sacrifices let their social life

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:50,280
suffer and and groove something that

00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:51,510
meant a lot to them real quick rapid

00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,880
fire let's talk over some of the key

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,810
points then I covered here that I think

00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,510
are the most important I managed to keep

00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,520
this side project versus the hundreds of

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,750
others I started going for five years

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,140
and I think that's because I've tricked

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,710
myself into making it hard to not though

00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,850
industry is changing our strategies must

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,520
change we can learn a lot of lessons

00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,050
from the people that we look at as

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,210
successful in the industry we can learn

00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,730
about how they worked hard and what they

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:24,510
value and you know what they centered

00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,970
themselves on but their specific tactics

00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,650
and strategies along the way probably

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,540
won't work exactly for us or at least in

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,280
the same way because the industry is

00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,200
just fundamentally different it's

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,240
changed rapidly even what worked two

00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,240
years ago might be off the table today

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,140
all of us as a group this can't be just

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,520
a few people in leadership it can't be

00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,310
just a bunch of let's preaching up here

00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:51,660
on the stage who are as Steve also

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:54,360
talked about not so well just fortunate

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,790
in our positions but all of us

00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:00,600
collectively need to just work harder on

00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:03,510
this like we're still not close we're

00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:09,080
not there yet and we have a long way to

00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:11,910
go when it comes to diversity I think I

00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,650
would ask especially those of you who

00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,570
are new to give the community a chance

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,680
just open yourself up to the

00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,090
conversation they're gonna have here

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,410
there are people who really want to help

00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,930
know people willing to approach the

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,070
conversation with you and say I'm not

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,930
looking to get something from you I'm

00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:28,110
going to help you if I can and just let

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:30,060
them and then open yourself up to that

00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,870
and might might change your life and I

00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,870
did for a lot of us here

00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,580
of course if things aren't going quite

00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:41,070
as well as you had hoped this is

00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,870
probably just the reality I think you

00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,730
just haven't failed enough times you

00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:47,310
might have to fail a few more times but

00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,650
you'll get there stick to it lastly of

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:53,610
course you don't want to quit and on

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:57,060
that note thank you for tuning in to

00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:59,910
this presentation and do we have any

00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,690
time for questions or no usually I'm

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:06,510
pretty long-winded we have time for 20

00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:12,770
questions no we don't time for two

00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:12,770
questions first in the back Terry hi

00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:35,009
okay Tara asked a little bit about where

00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:37,559
are these emerging markets in WordPress

00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:40,130
like what is what's kind of like on

00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,200
riding that wave a little bit and

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:52,349
increasing and also like where the VC

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:55,920
funding is going in this industry that's

00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,359
a that would be a fun thing to discuss

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,989
at length because I think there are a

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:04,700
lot of examples and I also think that

00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:07,739
we're in the early stages of this so a

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,930
lot of the examples are anecdotal at

00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:13,019
this point and it's difficult to really

00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,999
read too much into them because as I

00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:16,739
said it's early so we can look and see

00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:18,479
like there's been venture capital

00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:20,099
invested over in this and this and this

00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:23,309
but does that really mean that that's

00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:25,589
where the wave is going maybe we're not

00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,499
sure because it's it's still a little

00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:31,829
early we know that hosting is massive

00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:33,960
and WordPress specific hosting is just

00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:36,930
killing it right now so a lot of the

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,809
hosts who are who only cater to

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,390
WordPress that's their game are just

00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:45,269
rocking and rolling they're growing and

00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:48,150
crazy and raising funding round after

00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:50,249
round and and it's just crazy crazy town

00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,339
and all the hosts who aren't WordPress

00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:54,960
specific are like heavily investing into

00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,609
WordPress and like saying that well now

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,109
we offer managed wordpress hosting too

00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:59,519
and we're all about WordPress so we're

00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:00,960
gonna sponsor all the events in like

00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,469
WordPress WordPress WordPress that's us

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,200
and so hosting is like that we're pretty

00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:09,749
sure of that major venture capital major

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,519
wave in hosting highly competitive but

00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:17,009
still like all the money all the money a

00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:21,359
sort of stuff outside of hosting then

00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:23,539
it's a little more investments here and

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,430
there we see we've seen like some

00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:27,930
agencies get really really large most of

00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,170
those aren't taking funny and most of

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,960
those are bootstrap we've seen some like

00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:38,279
maintenance companies be acquired or

00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,590
very like specialized development

00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:42,180
agencies in some cases

00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,800
are really rockin and rollin like a

00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,970
certain discipline or certain part of I

00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,120
don't know what what's being demanded

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:54,840
these days some of those have been

00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,330
acquired or grown support companies

00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:03,510
sometimes have been able to scale up

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:04,740
rapidly and some of the product

00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,040
companies are really rocking and rolling

00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,810
like an e-commerce or some of the forms

00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,130
plugins but most of them are still

00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,450
bootstraps still the overwhelming

00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,410
majority of the industry it's the

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,180
bootstrap

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,600
I don't know that there's something

00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,640
specifically that stands out as like a
