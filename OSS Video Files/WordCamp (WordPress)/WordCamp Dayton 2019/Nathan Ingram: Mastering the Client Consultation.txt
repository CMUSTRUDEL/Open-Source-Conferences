00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,210
for WordPress freelancers I've been

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,010
doing that since 2014 it's a lot of fun

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,110
if my passion is to help WordPress

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,460
business owners grow and blow up the

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,810
common obstacles that's one of the

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,270
reasons I'm giving this talk today and

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,070
last of all I myself have been a

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,890
freelance business owner in the web

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,630
space since 1995 that's ancient I

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,460
realized that's when I built and sold my

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,979
first web site and I've made a million

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,420
mistakes since then so I used to start a

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,430
talk like this with a slide that says I

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,930
am NOT an expert but now I've decided

00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,840
that I am an expert

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,460
according to dr. Niels Bohr who says

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,040
that an expert is a person who is found

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,810
out by his own painful experience all

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,060
the mistakes a person can make in a very

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,909
narrow field by that definition I'm an

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,759
expert so if I can help you not make the

00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,049
same mistakes I make have made then

00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,149
that's why we're here today

00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,880
and a lot of the times a lot of the

00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,540
places we make mistakes as WordPress

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,689
business owners is in that first initial

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,950
client consultation the coffee meeting

00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,210
right where you're meeting with the

00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,770
client the first time trying to figure

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,880
out if this whole thing of what this

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,950
project is about but here's how we're

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,860
going to talk about over the next you

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,369
know 40 minutes or so the first is why

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,190
you desperately need a strategy for

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,550
client consultations and I promise you

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,110
desperately need a strategy then we're

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,069
gonna look at why are we doing this to

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,719
begin with

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,120
what is the purpose of the client

00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,540
consultation last of all we're gonna

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,310
talk about the scope strategy which is

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,780
really the meat of the presentation by

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,510
the way I love talking about clients

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,500
this is my second most favorite talk I

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,099
give on clients I'm glad you asked that

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,510
question

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,099
I actually wrote a book about it it just

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,120
dropped last month with Amazon it's

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,650
called dealing with problem clients

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,049
building for instance fences around

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,430
friendly monsters it's a lot of fun so

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,659
it's out there on Kindle and in print

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,129
and I may give a couple of books away

00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,590
today depending on what kind of time we

00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,939
have okay so we are going to pause for

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,930
questions at the end of each section

00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,030
okay

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,519
also you can tweet at me if you'd like I

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,879
am at Nathan Ingram on Twitter and the

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,620
hashtag wc8 and by the way so that you

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,870
don't have to furiously scribble if

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,780
you're typing pay attention download the

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,359
slides later Nathan Ingram comm /wc

Natan there you'll find all the slides

00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,650

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,169
there as a PDF also at that link you can

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,329
get a one-pager of the whole scope

00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:20,829

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,930
page it's right there go download it

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,229

a link to this book that's all right so

00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:32,229
but that's all there for free check it

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,720
out all right so why is it important to

00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,060
have a strategy for the client

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,739
consultation why is the scope strategy

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,239
important so I'm sitting in a coffee

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,829
shop and maybe you can relate to the

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,359
story I'm sitting in the coffee shop and

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,470
I'm meeting with the client for the

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,449
first time how many have you made with

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,250
clients over coffee if their place your

00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,720
place Starbucks where they yeah I do

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,069
that all the time there's a Starbucks

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,930
about a mile for me that it's like my

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,810
second office date it's like Cheers they

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,669
know my name so I'm sitting there I'm

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,769
thinking okay this client has real

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,329
potential right like this is going to go

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,489
well you know good great conversation

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:07,239
everything's going great and then all of

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,889
a sudden we keep talking and he starts

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,750
telling the story about how his dog got

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,090
out from the fence and it's going on and

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,889
on and all of a sudden it's 45 minutes

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,780
later and we're still talking about the

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,889
stupid dog I mean I love dogs got I have

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,430
two they're both rescue that's great

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:24,099
love dogs no problem but 45 minutes give

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,990
me a break so I've spent 45 minutes with

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,060
this client and we finally get around to

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,590
talking about the website this person

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,520
has no idea what they want they have no

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,080
goals no

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,180
they don't know what they want so I've

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,919
just wasted an hour of my life with this

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,509
person so have you ever been in a

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,009
situation where you've spent hours

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,710
talking to a client and gotten no clear

00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,840
that sound familiar yeah me too

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:48,190
okay so I'm sitting in that car one day

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,169
and I just meeting I just met with this

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,490
particular client you know I'm thinking

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,840
about you know this is going really well

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,030
and you know it's it's been a great

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,979
meeting and then I'm sitting there and

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:06,849
I'm thinking oh my gosh I forgot to

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:09,069
mention the fact that I offer WordPress

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,900
management services we talked all about

00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,240
their website and I didn't talk anything

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,919
about recurring services on the back end

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,289
and if I've learned anything over my

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,819
years of working with clients it's that

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,560
if you're gonna sell a WordPress

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,069
management plan security backups hosting

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,870
any of that stuff

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,970
you gotta start the first conversation

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,139
you can't add it on later they never buy

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,759
it it's got to start the first

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,560
conversation so I'm sitting there in my

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,599
car and I realize I forgot to talk about

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,880
this so have you ever gotten through a

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,440
meeting and realized you forgot to cover

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,680
something that was important for the

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,570
project me too that's why you need a

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,669
strategy for that first client meeting

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,729
how about this I'm checking my email and

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm waiting I'm waiting I'm waiting for

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,810
the client to respond after I'd email

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,130
them a proposal and is not agonize Dover

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,449
this proposal right you know how it goes

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,919
you sit there and you write everything

00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,440
down and you get a good scope of work

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,240
and you put a price tag on it and then

00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,039
you erase the present okay there's 35

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,270
minute no no

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,500
$4,500 no no 40 120 no no no 37 75

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,150
that's yeah right you ever do that

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,909
anybody else do that yeah okay so I'm

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,440
sitting there and I finally get the

00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:17,680
email and the client says wait a minute

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,979
I thought this was going to be like 500

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,979
bucks

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,970
so if you ever met with a client and

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,160
spent time agonizing over a proposal

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,350
only to realize you're way off the

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,450
client's price point yeah me too that's

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,580
why you need a strategy for the first

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,440
client meeting you've got to take

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,170
control of the meeting you are spending

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,070
your time with this client you got to

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,320
make it count

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,050
now I've bolded that word spending

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,660
because far too many of us don't realize

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,910
that's exactly what we're doing you are

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,890
committing some time to this particular

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,370
client who's made no reciprocal

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,050
commitment back to you you're choosing

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,520
to spend time with this client I don't

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,710
know what your hourly rate is but that's

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,680
what you're investing now hourly rate

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,060
for web work is $165 an hour so if I'm

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,830
gonna spend time with this client in

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,200
investing hour in this initial client

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,390
meeting it is as though I'm spending a

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,750
hundred and sixty-five dollars on that

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,310
client you're spending your time you got

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,480
to make it count and if you'll make that

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,210
switch in your mind this becomes

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,460
incredibly important incredibly

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,470
important how much money if you put $1

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,230
per hour how much money over the last

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,510
year have you wasted on clients by

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,340
spending too much time in the first

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,680
meeting and getting no return on your

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,660
investment far too much probably right

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,790
okay so let's talk about what is the

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,010
purpose of the initial client

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,400
consultation why are we there to begin

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,950
with

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,820
now the first answer is we're trying to

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,470
sell a website right for most of us

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
that's pretty wild steaming with a

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,290
client you're trying to figure out what

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,290
they want and sell them something and

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,260
that's part of it but it's not the whole

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,240
thing it's not just to sell a website I

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,010
would submit to you that the first

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,870
meeting with a client is like a first

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:15,230
date okay you've got to be sure that

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:19,610
this relationship is going to work how

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,770
many of you work with a bad client yes

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,900
okay we all have if you were if you're

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,550
working with clients you've had a bad

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,130
one that's why I call them friendly

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,410
monsters in this book you've worked with

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,030
bad clients okay now how many of you

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,419
realized at the very beginning from the

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,979
first conversation this is a bad

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,500
you did it anyway yes I'll we've all

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,020
done that too but so here's the thing

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,810
you got a position this first meeting

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,970
like the first day you are getting the

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:52,040
best version of this client that you're

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,780
ever going to get it's like a first date

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,870
I mean you go in yeah it's been a long

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,430
time since I was dating as many years my

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,100
wife and I'll celebrate 25 years this

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,850
year whoo-hoo we made it but you know so

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,320
what about you

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,790
but when you're meeting with the first

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,220
date you think about you're on your best

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,130
behavior and the client consultation is

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,320
that way so you're gonna figure out if

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,480
this whole thing is going to work now

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,120
let me let me talk about what the client

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,470
consultation is not because a lot of

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,660
times it's easier to define what

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,150
something is by figuring out what it's

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,740
not first it's not just to sell a

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,840
website that's part of it but it's not

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,700
the whole thing first of all it's a test

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,340
the waters test the relationship second

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,680
of all it's not to refine the clients

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,750
business plan how many of you have spent

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,220
time with a client and you realize I am

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,060
offering business consulting to this

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,900
person yeah by the way that's a separate

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,630
service and you should be charging for

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,490
that if you have the ability to do that

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,900
kind of thing the website may need to

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,730
come later we'll talk about that in just

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,560
a minute you are not there to refine the

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,780
clients business plan how much have they

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,840
committed to pay you at this point zero

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:05,360
dollars okay that's a whole other talk

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:10,190
also it's not to answer how questions

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:14,180
this is an important distinction how

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,010
questions are intellectual property I'll

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,390
answer all the what questions all day

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,290
long what are we going to build was it

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,830
need to be what does it need to look

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,530
like those are free how questions cost

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,960
money how questions are intellectual

00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,630
property so those are some of the things

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,089
that client consultation is not now if

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,770
you're like me you've wasted a lot of

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,190
time with clients doing those three

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,930
things and never gotten a dime back

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,360
return on investment for the time that

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,850
you can stick with the client so what do

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,140
you do what is the purpose of the client

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,830
consultation now I want to give you it

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,380
very easy to remember acronym

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,720
it is simply scoped there's five

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,760
purposes of the client consultation each

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,260
of which is one of these letters now

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,580
we're gonna do a deep dive into each of

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,740
these in just a minute but the first one

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,580
is easy the essence scope are you ready

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,980
for this stands for scope you got it

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,690
okay this is the easy one right the

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,920
essence scope stands for scope the first

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,329
thing you're gonna do in the client

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,550
consultation you're trying to learn

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,709
enough about the project to create a

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,720
proposal for the client now for most of

00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,010
us that's what we're doing already we're

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,329
there talking to the client we're trying

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,430
to figure out what their what they want

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,870
what can we do just to gather all the

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,060
information so we can present an

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,339
intelligent proposal back to the client

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,339
for what they're asking for right sounds

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,040
familiar this is what we do but for too

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,660
many of us it stops there and I'd like

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,230
to suggest there at least for other

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,540
purposes the C in scope stands for

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,100
chemistry you've got to figure out if

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,870
this is the person you can work with and

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,180
you better do that in that first meeting

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,860
if you're in that first meeting and

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,740
things are not going well it's time to

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,149
gracefully exit and maybe suggest

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,339
another web developer that could make

00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:59,310
them successful the O in scope stands

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,860
for ongoing ongoing services explain the

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,970
importance of the ongoing services you

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,230
offer and by the way you do offer

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,630
ongoing services right every single

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,029
person who builds WordPress sites for

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,370
clients needs to be offering WordPress

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,800
management services if you're not doing

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,450
that I promise you you will not be

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,260
successful in the long term it is

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,329
virtually impossible to succeed working

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,610
with clients unless you have some sort

00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:29,490
of recurring revenue starting with

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,790
WordPress management contracts coming in

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,790
to your business

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,570
in that conversation by the way has to

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,360
start at the first meeting that's got to

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,880
be positioned as part of the price that

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,970
you're offering the P in scope stands

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,279
for your process set expectations early

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,019
by walking through the process you used

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,360
to create websites and you do have a

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,339
process right if you don't have a

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,350
process that you use for every client

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,910
every project every time you need to

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,460
work on that that's one of the most

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,170
important things you can do

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,570
especially if you're just starting out

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,700
you need a codified process that you use

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,710
every time and don't get caught in the

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,570
lie that oh i build custom website me

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,470
too but i do it the same way for every

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:15,500
client every time there's a process and

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,050
by the way that process has as much

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,930
value as your in product to the client

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,940
and if you've explained that ok the Ian

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,209
scope stands for estimate and this is

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,830
really the secret sauce in this strategy

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,750
estimate providing a ballpark estimate

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,140
and getting client buy-in we'll talk

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,029
about that again in just a minute now

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,709
using this method last year I closed

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,839
over 90% of the proposals that I wrote

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,310
now always struggle matter of fact I set

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,240
right back in the back corner debating

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,190
on whether I was going to take this

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,480
slide out and I literally I gave this

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,520
talk about eight times last year

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,200
different work camps and every time

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,580
before I speak out I struggle over the

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,339
slide because what I don't want to come

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,680
across as is some you know slick weird

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,850
marketing that's not me okay and those

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,649
of you that know me you know that's not

00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,130
me but I just want you to know this

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,110
works

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:04,970
okay now why mmv your mileage may vary

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,830
but this works if you'll do this sort of

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,640
process tweak it for yourself but use

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,160
this sort of process this will increase

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,890
your conversion rate on proposals okay

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,830
let's take a deep dive you ready the

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,750
essence scope stands for scope we're

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,339
going to learn enough about the project

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,890
in order to create a proposal now again

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,540
this is where most i'ma spin the entire

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,220
time and that's good we're gonna spend

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,709
most of the time if you allocate an hour

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,380
probably 45 minutes of it it's gonna be

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,870
on this step working through what the

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,870
client actually needs now you may have a

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,700
way to do this and if you don't you you

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,160
need to have a consistent checklist of

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,380
questions that you ask for every client

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,370
every project every time to make sure

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,959
you don't forget something if you don't

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,790
have a checklist you're going to forget

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,170
something and Murphy's Law says the

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,459
thing you forget is gonna be the most

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,529
important thing that you should have

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:57,829
asked or you'll be sitting like me in my

00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,630
car thinking I talked about this alright

00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:02,410
so make a checklist use it every time

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,170
and I would suggest doing it this way

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:08,029
see what you want this is what I do I

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,700
break the conversation up into five main

00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,500
buckets of questions and I like this a

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,529
pro

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,060
because we can modify this depending on

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,250
the client we're talking to in other

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,199
words you know we can start with various

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,089
buckets depending on what is most

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,560
important to them there's a business

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,880
bucket we need to find out about them

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,920
there's a the purpose of the website

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,779
there's the website itself there's a

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,300
launch questions and there's budget

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,819
questions now depending on the client we

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,509
can rearrange that just for example I

00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:40,120
was meeting with a client who is a local

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:43,000
entity of a national nonprofit

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,639
organization I do a lot of work with

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,350
nonprofits by choice now if you know

00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,690
anything about local entities of

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,380
national organizations their budget is

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,480
zero dollars especially for marketing

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,029
and so guess where I started the

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,680
conversation being write their budget

00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,410
because we're not gonna go any further

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,779
if there's no company over you can

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,670
modify this based on the client now I'm

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,829
gonna put a bunch of questions up on the

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,600
screen here okay it's all in that one

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,769
page download or feel free to snap or

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,079
whatever but here's some questions you

00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,940
want to ask in these five main buckets

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,010
and again turn this into a checklist I

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,690
have a template in Evernote that I just

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,569
duplicate for every client meeting check

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,010
check check that make notes check check

00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:26,110
do something like that so you make sure

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,670
you don't forget anything so here's the

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,100
business bucket these are the sorts of

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,170
questions you ought to be asking to

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,339
every client about their business what's

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,810
your elevator pitch what's your coffee

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,430
shop answer when somebody asks you who

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,079
you are and what do you do what's your

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,760
answer to that question if they can't

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,290
clearly articulate what they do in two

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,329
or three sentences you may have a

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,160
marketing problem this person may not be

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:46,810
able to articulate it and if they can't

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,949
articulate their business how in the

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:53,170
world do they expect you as a web

00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:54,069
developer to do it right what do you do

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,930
what do you make who's your competition

00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:58,199
who's your ideal customer why do they

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,519
choose you instead of your competition

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,019
what's your price point how do you find

00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,240
your customers now do you have any

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,620
existing brand identity these are

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,919
questions you need to figure out the

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,620
answer to the goal of this bucket is to

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,530
understand how much they understand

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,540
their business I am constantly amazed at

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,790
the number of small business owners and

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,130
even professionals who don't know who

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,709
they're serving they don't know why they

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,120
don't get their market at all and there

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,409
hoping that will they say I have to have

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,209
a website and that's gonna solve all

00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:29,860
their problems but wait a minute if they

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,350
can articulate the message of their

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,299
business how can you a third party who

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,250
build websites do that for them now you

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:38,710
may be able to you may have the

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,659
marketing chops to help them create that

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,570
but guess what that's different than the

00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:47,080
website that's work that's to happen

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,360
first that's marketing consulting and

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,240
you may or may not be able to do that if

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,279
you can awesome that's the first thing

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,860
you pitch to them then we create a

00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,510
website otherwise you're no different

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,470
than somebody that's building you know

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,720
do-it-yourself stuff on Squarespace if

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,419
you can't help them articulate their

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,350
message to reach their market the

00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:12,820
website is not going to be effective

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,549
okay those are the sorts of questions

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,350
now and again by the way the client may

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,450
not be ready for a website and marketing

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,659
consulting may be the first step how

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,190
many of you get stalled on content the

00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:28,120
client takes forever to give you content

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,919
for the website ah you know I've been

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,990
stalled for almost two years with a

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,179
client on contest years ago this is what

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,409
content takes forever because if you're

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,000
doing your job and you're asking the

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,000
right questions about what it is the

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,549
website is supposed to say the business

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,679
owner freezes up because oh my gosh I

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,340
don't know how to articulate my message

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,990
and so they sit there with the blank

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,630
screen and they know they don't were to

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,279
start so marketing consulting may be

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,080
something they need at the beginning the

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,320
second bucket of questions is the

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:07,320
purpose the purpose bucket how does the

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,320
web fit into your marketing strategy

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,250
it's remarkable how many times I get a

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,870
deer-in-the-headlight look from that

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,360
question when I ask it to a small

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,300
business owner marketing strategy

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,340
don't I just need a website if we build

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,590
it they will come you know that whole

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,890
approach why should your ideal customer

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:31,730
even come to your website what are you

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,500
offering them what are your goals for

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,930
the website that last one is the most

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,720
important thing to figure out because we

00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,910
said earlier you know the conversation

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,280
about you know we're not building the

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:46,580
website for the client we're building

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,640
the website for who the clients clients

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,340
the clients customers and so if at the

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,890
beginning you get written down a great

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,910
purpose statement for what is how do we

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,890
know the website is going to be

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:03,320
successful then the questions of is that

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,990
shade of blue right which Lord how many

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,940
of you have that conversation

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,340
those questions don't matter if they

00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,750
don't get you to the goal at that point

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,080
we get into personal preference and

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,120
quite frankly frequently I'll have a

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,950
conversation with the client that goes

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,070
something like this we're not building

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:25,670
this website to reach you you're already

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,260
reached I hope I mean I hope you're

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,540
already a fan of your own business we're

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,790
trying to reach your constituency or

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,290
your potential market so the shade of

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,090
blue just trust me it the the

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,710
call-to-action button doesn't need any

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,900
glue an easily bright orange because

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,300
that's what people are going to click or

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,560
whatever it needs to be bringing

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,850
conversation back to the goal that's all

00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,710
in the purpose so get all that down at

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,050
the beginning again by the way the

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,810
client may not be ready for a website if

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,760
they can't answer these questions your

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,770
step needs to be we need to step back

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,630
and do a discovery phase well we're

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,070
gonna figure out all the answers to

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,710
these questions that you don't know the

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,840
answers to and a discovery phase sounds

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,130
really fancy it's simply a list of all

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,360
the questions we're gonna answer in a

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,550
price to find those answers

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,410
it's a scope and the price just like a

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,960
project and at the end they get a nice

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,760
report and that's what they pay for and

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,850
from that we can now build the website

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,740
and be successful if that makes sense

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,060
scope and deliverables for price alright

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,010
so we've talked about the business we

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,980
talked about the purpose now we get into

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,240
the website bucket now for most

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,860
freelancers this is all they ever ask

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,510
about they don't get into any of the

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,880
other buckets and if that's what you're

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,680
doing you need to expand the questions

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,060
you're asking but these are important

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,740
right you have a domain name

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,090
who's our point of contact at your

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,130
company that's there's a loaded question

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,560
here but you want to know that am i

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,210
working with an eighteen committee or am

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,030
i working with you the business owners

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,860
because that's important if there's a

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,520
layer between me and you

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,410
we're not gonna be successful probably

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,550
who's not point of contact where will

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:01,320
the content for the site come from

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,640
there's a huge assumption that's made by

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,170
most clients that you're not only going

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,060
to build the tech behind the website

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,180
you're gonna create the content as well

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,920
and maybe you can do that but if you do

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,540
it your price needs to go up or you need

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,670
to bring in a copywriter and charge

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,500
accordingly most clients aren't

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,980
qualified to write the content for their

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,470
site in a way that is digestible by

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,940
their target market roughly how many

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,710
pages will site include now that's a

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,300
soft question because you and I both

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,030
know that in WordPress it's copy paste

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,320
boom publish page done and so back in

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,690
the day when we were doing everything

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,640
baked with HTML the number of pages was

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,910
important today not as big of a deal

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,040
unless you're using a page builder in

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,350
your hand crafting pages so I will

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,900
frequently in a proposal you know talk

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,960
about we're gonna create custom crafted

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,100
pages for these sections and like

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
there's five other than that's gonna

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,830
affect the price point because those

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,860
take a lot more time than just copy

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,120
paste publish right alright are you

00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,680
going to be blogging or sharing news

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,870
items are you selling things online

00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,580
there's another subsection of questions

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,890
that come if it's gonna be an e-commerce

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,450
site do you need an event calendar do

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,490
your clients need to log in for any

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,720
reason that's a big question to ask

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,700
because I've gotten to the end of the

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,730
project and they go where to my client's

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,040
login to get their bills online Oh what

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,690
we don't even talked about that massive

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,640
assumption you've got to ask all these

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,200
questions at the beginning do you use

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,090
social media which networks do you have

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,650
video you want to use testimonials do

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,660
you have them already or are we gonna be

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,300
waiting six months for you to get around

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,240
to asking your customer for testing

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,460
are there any third-party integrations

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,530
needed because if so then we've just

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,810
added a zero probably at the end of your

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,580
project depending on what it is should

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,800
the website simply be a credibility

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,600
piece or do you want to generate leads

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,980
from search results that's such an

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,310
important question to ask if you're not

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,220
doing it now a lot of clients don't need

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:55,220
to pay for SEO if you build the website

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,770
with good solid best practices for a

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,860
technical SEO on page that's done well

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,810
they may not need advanced SEO a lot of

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,610
small businesses especially they don't

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:08,980
have the manpower to deal with twenty

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:11,270
leads a week off the web they want one

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,000
some clients would be happy if they had

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,180
three solid leads a month off their

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,280
website you know if if people search my

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,310
business name are they gonna find me yes

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,290
if you build the site right virtually

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,120
always just a wordpress out of the box

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,650
as long as you're not intentionally

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,260
screwing something up you're gonna have

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,090
pretty good technical SEO right off the

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,910
bat just with the way word breastfeeds

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,170
the information to the search engines do

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,180
they need to pay for more I don't know

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,410
that's a question to ask last of all

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,630
this is the catch-all question this

00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,640
always ends this bucket of questions for

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,740
me aside from communicating information

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,200
and other things we've talked about is

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,340
there anything else the website needs to

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,860
do because we need to know that is there

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,090
anything else at all and sometimes later

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,050
on the client they come back and say

00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,570
well I thought it was going to do this

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,850
but remember I asked you is there

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:05,050
anything else the website needs to do

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:10,520
and you said no I'm happy to do that

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:13,310
that's gonna cost me right okay the

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,080
launch getting to the fun part there's

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,400
some questions you need to ask about the

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,950
launch of the website do you have a

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:25,490
deadline and is it tomorrow right how do

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:28,640
you handle email how many of you have

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:32,850
stepped into the black hole of hell that

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,020
is client email oh my gosh

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,920
we stopped providing email services

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,080
years ago for that very reason that's

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,640
not that's a long conversation last of

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,190
all who will be responsible for

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,360
maintaining the site after it's been

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,820
launched because that's important okay

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,860
the goal here is determining the time

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,380
frame and starting the discussion about

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,990
those ongoing services last of all the

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,250
budget bucket the budget bucket is hey

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,480
do you have a ballpark budget for this

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:06,210
what are we talking about here do you

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,170
have $500 or 5,000 or 20l what is it

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,940
some clients don't want to answer that

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,680
question but I simply tell them look I

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,290
need to understand what we're talking

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,840
about here because maybe we can simplify

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,310
or do things in phases if you have a

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,660
small budget we can work with that we

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,030
can build you something good and solid

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,460
but in your price range and later we can

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,650
expand to add these other nice things

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,160
that you'd like to have what is by the

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,210
way the decision making process for

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,370
selecting your web developer for this

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,260
project how you know is are you happy

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,630
you have to get three bids is it whoever

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,920
you personally like are you just having

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,990
to get a number of bids so you can

00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,370
really select your next-door neighbour

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,710
who you want to do the website to begin

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,930
with what's the decision-making process

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,320
is it you that's making the decision or

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,360
is it your boss or some committee what

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,920
is that process why and when do you

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,460
expect to make that final decision the

00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,040
goal here

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,710
just make sure you're not wasting time I

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,580
don't respond to RFPs simply because it

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,770
takes too long

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,420
that's not my market you know if you're

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,730
interviewing ten other web developers

00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,990
probably not my client you know it's not

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,220
that I couldn't compete in that world

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,620
but I just don't want to deal with the

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,540
hassle and the length of time if you

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,600
want to hire me hire me let's go let's

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,100
let's do the work okay so those are the

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,360
five buckets of questions that make

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,950
sense any questions on this stuff that

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,550
we've talked about so far before we go

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,550
into chemistry

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,080
yes okay

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm gonna talk about that in a minute

00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:42,960
yep we'll get to that if that's in the e

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,960
of scope the estimate

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,710
such as

00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,240
okay yeah so what do you do it's the

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,430
client for the recording what do you do

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,220
if the client is wanting something

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:08,700
that's just not the best idea that's a

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,260
so in the first meeting you don't want

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,660
to spend a lot of time there but it's a

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,400
great test of the water for you to push

00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,110
back and go you know for what you're

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,690
describing that doesn't sound like the

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,930
best idea what if we did this and their

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,240
response that that their response to

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,650
what you tell them in that scenario is

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,910
gonna tell you a lot about whether

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,710
that's person we want to work with or

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,330
not are they gonna insist on having

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,860
their own way or are they going to

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,750
listen to the professional because if

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,430
they push back now when I'm probably

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,780
going to start landing the plane in in

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,810
the meeting because they're not gonna

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:51,080
take money this is a tip of the iceberg

00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:51,080
yeah yes at what point do you yes

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,610
yep

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,310
sure

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,720
yep

00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,360
okay did you guys get that you see how

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,160
important that question is okay the

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,330
answer to that question is the answer to

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,970
this it's the same answer to this

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,950
question which is how can you compete

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,419
designing custom website sites when

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,610
there's free options like Wix and Lulu

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,929
and Squarespace the answer is were

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,480
always a consultant

00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:59,100
the reason they hire us is not because

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,960
we can put a site together in WordPress

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,150
it's that we can solve their problem

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,340
they may not be able to fully articulate

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,080
the problem but we may be able to help

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,700
them understand it and then bring a

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,260
solution that solves the problem to

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,480
reach more customers to get more leader

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,390
whatever it is that's the value you

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,250
bring it's the reason why I'm hiring a

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,919
tile person to come in and tile my

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,220
bathroom instead of going to Home Depot

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,410
and buying a bunch of tile it's the same

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,150
issue I don't know if I'm answering your

00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,770
question or not but you're always a

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,900
consultant that's the value you bring

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,700
that's why you can charge the money that

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,080
you're asking otherwise send them to

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,820
Squarespace and let them figure it out

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,650
you know those websites look beautiful

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,690
on TV buddy TV but if you ever seen one

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,240
in person

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,020
wow it's like me trying to do tile in my

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
bathroom

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,290
one's gonna be like int now wife's gonna

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,290
go this is not gonna do

00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,330
[Music]

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,100
yes I'm gonna answer that in just a

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,620
minute yeah we'll get to that at the end

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,910
if that's the e part yeah okay so let's

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,490
press forward here because I'm running

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,020
short on time actually I didn't realize

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,940
so let's talk about chemistry you got to

00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:20,590
decide is this a client you can work

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:23,050
with okay huge hugely important listen

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,250
when you're at you've probably spent 45

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,460
minutes or so with a client at this

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,520
point roughly during that time listen

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,800
just listen to what they say and most

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,960
importantly how they say it when you

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,880
push back on things how are they you

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,470
know are they or do they respect you as

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,660
a professional they respect your opinion

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,620
watch for those red flags because but at

00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,940
the end of this point when you've

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,890
reached the scope into the scope

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,080
questions you want to have a good

00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,850
feeling of whether this is a person you

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,580
can work with or not are you gonna be

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,770
able to do something good good work for

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,360
this particular client and for everybody

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,710
the answer is not always the same you

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,730
know this may not be a client I can work

00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,560
with and that's okay

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,270
you gotta it's it's like dating you got

00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,010
to see if there's chemistry there can I

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,660
actually work with this person now

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,910
there's a few red flags and I see a lot

00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,860
of times from my own experience and in

00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,810
coaching you know I've had hundreds of

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,070
coaching conversations with freelance

00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,140
web developers over the last several

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,580
years and the first is unanswered

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,740
questions if the client doesn't know

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,750
what they need obviously a discovery

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,310
face can be helpful so watch for those

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,830
unanswered questions if they can't

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:26,020
answer it then you're gonna have to add

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,420
more time in for that another red flag

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,460
is being disrespectful if the client

00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,590
doesn't listen to you if they're not

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,600
taking your advice if they interrupt you

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,190
if they're already nickel-and-diming you

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,900
out of the gate oh I can get hosting for

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:42,340
five dollars a month over at blah blah

00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:46,300
blah com run okay if the client is a

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,740
jerk this is not a person you want to

00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,170
work with and you don't have to work

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,480
with everybody if there's scheduling

00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,760
problems if the person you're trying to

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,040
meet with is hard to reach or if they

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,750
reschedule if they're late this again

00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,130
it's not necessarily a deal breaker but

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,020
it's a red flag that you better pay

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,060
attention to because if the client is

00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,410
hard to reach now that's probably not

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,480
going to change when you're working with

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,250
them on building the website it's

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,610
probably not going to change if the

00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,230
client complains about a web developer

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,120
who

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:20,190
did everything wrong that's a full stop

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,980
we're gonna dig into that okay now let

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,740
me say this I've been in the web space a

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,419
long time and I know that there are a

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,270
bunch of knuckleheaded web developers

00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,860
out there okay how many of you've done

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,230
rescue work this is the kind where

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,490
somebody built the website and had they

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,470
made some stupid decisions when they

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,870
built that thing I don't know why I'm

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,690
here today website one time that had 33

00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:46,530
different custom image sizes defined who

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:48,210
does that who does that oh really it was

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,169
stupid and then the web developer poof

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,400
they're gone they disappeared the

00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:51,330
clients locked out of their website they

00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,890
don't have that don't have anything

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,179
rights okay there's a bunch of

00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,809
knucklehead and web developers out there

00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,100
that said if a client complains about a

00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:01,260
previous web developer who did

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,179
everything wrong I'm gonna stop it dig

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,220
into that because it could be this is

00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,220
the client that cannot be pleased and if

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,330
I don't weed that out early then six

00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,740
months from now that guy's gonna be

00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,659
sitting across a table from another web

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:19,020
developer complaining about me right

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,190
complaints huge red flag emergencies the

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,609
client needs everything done immediately

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:29,760
again not a deal-breaker but you better

00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:31,800
figure out why couple of frequent

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,629
mistakes I see folks make and that's

00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,950
ignoring those red flags we want to work

00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:39,570
with somebody we want to get paid for

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,000
our work so we'll ignore the red flags

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,710
and take on a bad client if you think a

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,350
red flag is no big deal

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,750
you're making a mistake again this is

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,100
the first day red flags or the tip of

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,600
the iceberg there's a whole lot more

00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,149
underneath that you better figure out

00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,700
don't make excuses for the client

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:58,109
in your own mind I want to work with

00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,790
them therefore I'll kind of ignore these

00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,680
things that I feel just not quite right

00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,440
trust your gut when it comes to working

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,190
with clients another frequent mistake is

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,400
the hero syndrome the hero syndrome is

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,500
the need to fix the client the hero

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,450
syndrome is going above and beyond doing

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,460
way more than you're paid for to come in

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,740
with your boots and cape and save the

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,609
day and that will destroy your business

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:26,390
as a reformed hero I tell you this from

00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:28,430
personal experience

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,660
this is our talk on this and I'll have

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,190
time to get into it today all right so

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,680
you with me that's the scope that's s

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,509
and chemistry now let's talk about the

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,390
Oh which is your on billing services

00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:40,670
explain the need for your ongoing

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,839
services now what I've learned over the

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,670
years I mentioned it earlier is that

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,910
when it comes to selling WordPress

00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,650
management products if you want to build

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,630
recurring revenue by selling we're

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,299
hosting and backups of security and

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,160
WordPress updates and all those things

00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:58,069
education is the key and it's got to

00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,759
start from the first conversation take

00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:01,460
it to the bank

00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:03,259
you can try to add this on later or it

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,119
comes in as a gotcha oh when you're

00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:08,119
launching the site oh by the way you

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,099
need to pay me 50 75 100 hundred $50 a

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,219
month don't manage your website the

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:15,140
client is gonna feel screwed you can't

00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:17,630
because that has to be talked about from

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,739
the first conversation so and I just

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,150
explained to them look this isn't

00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,229
WordPress needs to be kept up to date

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,719
there are certain things that need to

00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:25,160
happen and I'm not you know they don't

00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,019
need to make a decision right now but

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,430
we'll teach you how to do it or we

00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,019
provide a White Glove service that does

00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,229
it for you you just need be aware that's

00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:36,349
part of the pricing here the kind of

00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:38,630
client that I work with is relieved to

00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:41,029
know they'll have somebody in the web

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:45,200
space they can trust to manage their

00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:46,880
website I'll pay you $100 a month 200

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,680
$300 a month depending on what you're

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,329
doing I'll pay you for your work I'm

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,479
just I'm glad to know that I have

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,710
someone to call I call it having one

00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:57,160
neck to strangle when it comes to

00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,509
everything about your website right I

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,019
provide everything for them okay

00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:05,380
education is the key the P and scope

00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:08,210
stands for process set expectations

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,680
early by walking through your process

00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,849
and again you do have a project right

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,200
that you use for every client every

00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:14,299
project every time if you don't have

00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,670
that you need that so you're working

00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:19,729
every project the same way talk it

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,829
through with the client explain the

00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:24,289
steps that are involved explain the

00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:26,930
tools that are involved by tools I mean

00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:29,660
the stuff they're gonna interact with as

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,210
a client explain the value that your

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,509
process brings we are not those kinds of

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,579
web developers are gonna

00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:37,619
puron you halfway through the project we

00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,659
have this is the way we do enterprise by

00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,149
explaining your process to the client it

00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,909
builds up your credibility your process

00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:47,009
has as much value as the end product and

00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:48,599
when you explain this to the client you

00:37:47,009 --> 00:37:50,249
know you're not going to be left on your

00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,309
own we're gonna walk with this is how we

00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:54,389
build websites set expectations for what

00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:58,229
that's gonna look like doesn't have to

00:37:54,389 --> 00:38:02,880
take long just explain it last of all

00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:05,099
the estimate provide a ballpark estimate

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,989
at the end of the conversation and get

00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:13,619
client buy-in now this is key because I

00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:17,459
have spent lots of time working on a

00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,899
proposal far too much time fiddling on

00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:21,979
the price fiddling on the price

00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:24,149
thirty-five hundred four thousand 37:25

00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:26,099
3775 until you find some number that

00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:28,349
resonates magically with you and then

00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,089
you set it off to the client it is much

00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:32,729
better to talk about price at the very

00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:36,479
beginning of your interaction with the

00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:37,979
client we hate talking about price for

00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,630
the most part most of us are scared to

00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:42,119
death to talk about money with the

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,439
client but if you're if your ability to

00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,369
talk about money with the client is one

00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:47,579
of the things that will make you

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:50,249
successful in the web business you gotta

00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,839
get your head around it so what I do you

00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:54,199
by this point you want to know enough

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,089
about the project to offer a ballpark

00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,259
ballpark price I usually give a thousand

00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:59,069
dollar range you do what you want to do

00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,929
this is what I do

00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,880
okay so I'll finish up this conversation

00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:03,929
they'll say mister client mrs. client

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,789
based on everything we've talked about

00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:06,929
today what you're describing is a

00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:08,489
website that's probably going to be

00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,639
between five and six thousand dollars to

00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:14,309
build if I return to you tomorrow

00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:19,019
a proposal within that price range are

00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:23,609
you ready to start and if not I'm gonna

00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:26,189
figure out why not now you go back you

00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:29,669
build the proposal and it comes in that

00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:32,130
price range and they'll be ready to

00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:33,329
start if they're if they're not good

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,569
with that price range

00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:40,069
why would I invest any more time in this

00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:42,419
client relationship than I already have

00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:44,759
if they're you know without them being

00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:45,860
committed to that price range I'm not

00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:47,360
gonna spend the hour

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,740
take to write that proposal or 30

00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,110
minutes or two hours or however long

00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:54,140
it's gonna take you why would you spend

00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:58,520
more time I've wasted hours of my life

00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:59,810
doing that maybe you have to so you come

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,730
back with a proposal that has no

00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,960
surprises and it contains the management

00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,490
fee every month that contains the

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,950
website within the price range that you

00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:10,520
quoted no surprises let's do business

00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,470
together that makes sense let's the

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,570
scope strategy it starts with the scope

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,580
of the project chemistry with the client

00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,560
your ongoing services and overview of

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,940
your process and that estimate to get

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,670
the client buy-in before you go any

00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:29,110
further you do that last year close 90%

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,250
of the proposals that I wrote it works

00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,080
all right let's take questions again my

what tomorrow holds so this is an

00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,010
important question to answer if you

00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:36,040
don't have that start putting something

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,960
like that together okay what do you do

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,180
you develop a network of freelancers you

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,380
have some for me personally I have a

00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,040
support manager that handles all my

00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,090
client support needs she has the key to

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,350
the kingdom for everything in my

00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,420
business and my wife knows who she is

00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,910
and if that happens then we're covered

00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,530
well I have a step-by-step document that

00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:56,590
guides through all that we all need

00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,210
something like that and it can be as

00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,740
simple as I have a friend that's a

00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,410
freelancer and we do this for each other

00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,970
we have our master LastPass password we

00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,620
understand how I visit you know whatever

00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,730
but you need to have somebody like that

00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,990
in your life thanks for asking that

00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,730
question that I answer it or do that

00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,390
skip around too much thank you very much

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,390
yes

00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:20,730
how do you fire a client okay that's a

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:23,589
great question okay so you you know it I

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,550
work these days exclusively by referral

00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:27,520
I don't spend any money on advertising

00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:28,960
never really have and so the answer to

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,460
that question is how do they find you if

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,730
they just find you also all you know

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,319
online it may be a little simpler if a

00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,480
client comes to me and I realize they're

00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,069
not a good fit or you know it depends on

00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,730
we're in the process of the project they

00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:44,710
are the answer varies it's a we can talk

00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,290
after I'm happy but like if you're in

00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,970
this conversation you guys this is not a

00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,440
client that you want to work with but

00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,180
that client is being referred to you by

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,160
one of your good clients you want to

00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,559
make that referral look like gold so you

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,119
don't want to say I can't work you need

00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,579
to give them what's your next day I

00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,599
don't think we're a good fit based on

00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:03,250
what you've described I don't think I'm

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,200
gonna be able to help you let me offer

00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,170
you a few other recommendations if the

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,369
client just a jerk first of all most of

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,690
my clients are good people

00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:12,640
or they're all good people and they're

00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,900
not gonna refer jerks good people like

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
to refer good people to good people

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,220
that's why it's good to build your

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,630
network but you know if you're in the

00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,530
middle of the project then you need to

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:25,359
have a clear documented process of what

00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,430
happens if you're if you've been engaged

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,530
by a client and that relationship needs

00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,710
to sever what happens next that needs to

00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:38,490
be outlined in your contract so that's a

00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:38,490
long answer get a contract

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,500
if you look at Nathan Ingram calm in the

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,510
courts of section there's a process

00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,610
course of which this talk is a part and

00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:53,200
my whole contract I'll use the clients

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:56,130
is in that course yes how do you get the

00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,130
content from the client a vacuum cleaner

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,930
doesn't work okay so it's hard and the

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,490
reason client stall on content is they

00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,170
have trouble articulating what they do

00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,300
it's hard how many of you by the way

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,280
have been sitting trying to redevelop

00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,690
your website for forever

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,330
and you're having trouble with your own

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:15,610
content right okay and we're supposed to

00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,990
the professionals so have some empathy

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,420
on the client you have to do it for

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,740
themselves alright so there's a couple

00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,990
of things that it's a client first of

00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,850
all us every project starts with a

00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,140
Content guide where it's just a big long

00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,000
word document that asks lots of

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,410
questions to help them start thinking

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,460
through this is your about page this is

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,140
where you're gonna talk about this in

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,760
this how do you describe this in you how

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,920
do you describe it it's just full of

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,970
leading questions and they start typing

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,770
okay if they have trouble with that

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,900
there's two options we can hire a

00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,160
copywriter to come in and basically walk

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,500
through that whole content guy interview

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,510
style or you know I do a lot of writing

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,310
myself and some depending on the client

00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,260
I'll schedule a half a day or a day to

00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,360
sit down with them and help them process

00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,130
that information but it starts with you

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,110
know all every project we do has a

00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,670
content guide and that will that does it

00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,800
goes a long way now there is something

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,290
that's very important it's a phrase that

00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,150
a friend of mine named Adam Walker from

00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,410
Atlanta used years ago and it's totally

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:10,480
changed my business okay you ready for

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:12,100
this no code before content no code

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,260
before content these days I call it

00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,940
content first which means we don't move

00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,560
an inch on your project until we have a

00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,660
hundred percent of your content in-house

00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,630
ready to go otherwise what happens is

00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,980
you get one day the about page and then

00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,300
you're with websites asleep for a week

00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,040
then the next day you get over to the

00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,330
next thing of the bio and six months

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,140
from now we're still waiting on the CEO

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,210
to get his freaking picture taken right

00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,710
we give them the content guide and we

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,530
don't move an inch until we get it back

00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,719
and all the assets for the website every

00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,969
picture every video every everything

00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,499
then we build the website how quickly

00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:47,319
could you build the website if you had

00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:49,660
100% of the assets at the beginning few

00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:52,119
days then why not do that it's your

00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,309
process that's what your that's what

00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,489
your process needs to be right it's it's

00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:01,019
so simple but I've wasted months of my

00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:01,019
life not doing it that way

00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:09,640
it's coming I don't have it out yet yeah

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,640
yeah sorry

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,640
sure

00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,910
yes

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,259
okay so here's the thing something in

00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,250
the way that you said that makes me

00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,109
think I know if you think that's a good

00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,059
idea or not but so here's the thing I've

00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:30,039
tried everything there are lots of

00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:31,779
services out there you know and some

00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,190
clients are intimidated by a you know

00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:35,140
service like contents near which is a

00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,720
great solution I know the guy that built

00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,130
it you know it's a good solution some

00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,329
clients are intimidated about sitting in

00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,039
front of a website and I've been in

00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,269
their stuff

00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:47,890
everybody can open a word processing

00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:49,210
document and type so it's a word doc for

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,880
google doc wherever you want to use but

00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,279
the point is you want to ask a bunch of

00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,349
questions leading questions and the

00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:59,769
content guide is probably 80% the same

00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:01,509
from those sites that do the same but

00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:02,799
you know other parts and by the way and

00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:04,210
that content guy is not just the content

00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:05,680
for the website ask questions about

00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,450
their domain name in the registration

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,759
and different things when we get that

00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:14,289
guide every single thing we need to

00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:17,019
build that website is in it and you know

00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:20,400
I'm I'm one for simple solutions and I

00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,400
just can't get away from the workout

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,960
yes

00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,400
yes and so in particular and I'm working

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,250
on the content deeper piece for that

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,200
issue right now learning at the very

00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,570
beginning is the client I'm talking to a

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,040
people person or are they a task person

00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:24,380
those people are one or the other that's

00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,560
just brain wiring if it's a people

00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,360
person it might behoove me to as part of

00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,920
the scope of work schedule and a half a

00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,150
day to sit with them in there because a

00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,770
people person who's going to struggle

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,860
sitting in front of a blank room and

00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:38,300
typing away it's just schedule time for

00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:41,030
them just and just ask them those

00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,440
questions directly and the price goes up

00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,060
on the website to accommodate for that

00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,950
time but I'll sit in front of them with

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,630
Evernote and record the conversation and

00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:49,790
take notes and you know right in the

00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:51,650
turn oh they said you know 15 minutes

00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,210
and 32 seconds they explain it this way

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,860
and it was great you know I'll go back

00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,930
and you know as we're putting all the

00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,700
content together that's what the content

00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,890
comes from if they're a task oriented

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,160
person that process will scare them to

00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:02,930
death

00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,700
because they want to think about it you

00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,230
know they're the person that's going to

00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,600
be better with a document on the screen

00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,630
so you know just know who you're dealing

00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,630
with

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,869
okay here's the question are they

00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:05,380
selling are they here the question is

00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:07,810
are they selling bug zappers then the

00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:14,040
bad idea because if they're selling bug

00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:14,040
zappers that's genius yeah

00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:43,610
right and that's where I love I love it

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,050
when the client has bad ideas during

00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:47,510
this first country's country because

00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,850
what that can do is short-circuit a bad

00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,650
client relationship before it starts no

00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:54,560
pun intended with the bug zapper but so

00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,300
here's the thing it's like the question

00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,210
we had a minute ago when you push back

00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,380
on a client and say that's a bad idea

00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,960
their next response to you is kind of

00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:05,000
fun if you can work with them and so I

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,770
look for those sorts of things in those

00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,730
conversations it's a test of the water -

00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,730
it's a chemistry test

00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,959
yeah

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:29,270
on the fly I got you two alright so if

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,799
let's just say in the scenario that this

00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,200
came up three you know we're in the

00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,990
project oh hey look at this nice shiny

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,609
thing literally that I want to do we're

00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:40,880
gonna end the puns about birds a bug

00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:42,410
zapper too so here's what you say you

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,260
know if we did that it's gonna cost you

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:46,789
about a thousand dollars is it is it

00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,740
that important and we do not

00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:52,160
professionally I don't think that's

00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,960
gonna get us to the goal the goal that

00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:02,470
we agree that this website is supposed

00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:02,470
to accomplish right yes

00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:13,160
yes and there's so much wisdom Alma

00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:15,410
Topher just said they're hot well

00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:20,319
they've hired you because you know more

00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,319
than they do so don't be afraid of that

00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:27,760
all right any other questions we need to

00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,760
wrap up yes

00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,390
yes

00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,790
oh great question great question

00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,140
so in my in my process a good process

00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,600
and a good contract is a validation it's

00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,670
a balance of expectations and

00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,160
consequences right and we're very clear

00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:05,350
any relationship is based on commitments

00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,030
and we're gonna we're gonna commit back

00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:09,160
and forth to each other okay I've just

00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,810
committed to you some time I'm not gonna

00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,280
commit back to you more time to write a

00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,930
proposal one so if you commit to me that

00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,460
this price range is good I'm gonna give

00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,840
you its proposal the very next thing

00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,630
needs to happen is another commitment

00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,760
back to me of a check okay so they're

00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:24,010
gonna pay half up front typically in my

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,660
process it's always half up front

00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,760
now what depending on the length of the

00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,890
project they may pay twenty-five

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,680
twenty-five or a half you know the last

00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:35,110
half upon launch if it's a small project

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,690
so you know will start the work not

00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:40,030
until we get the deposit and we don't

00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:42,580
launch until the project in full is paid

00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:47,340
for and I don't have collections

00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,340
problems at all sure

00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,410
I actually actually have in my contract

00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:19,190
that the deposit is non-refundable for

00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:20,569
any reason and I stand on that because I

00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,799
put a you know by the time we get to the

00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:23,510
even the point of the proposal I've got

00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,849
several hours into the project dealing

00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:28,010
with them and don't think that all the

00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:29,960
the nurturing that got you to the point

00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:31,369
of the signing of the contract that has

00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,069
value it's just as valuable as what

00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:39,710
comes after so you know that for me I

00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:40,910
don't do any refunds at all even even

00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:45,339
when there's a bad situation I'd better

00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,339
refund it yeah sure

00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:02,880
it depends on if that's a particular

00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:04,230
concern to the client yes if it's most

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,170
point don't ask about that it's very

00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:08,900
plainly worded in the contract so yeah

00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:13,040
it depends on the client

00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,040
any other questions yes

00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:43,520
there's no such thing yeah there's no

00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,950
such thing you know you need to you need

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,540
to you have to figure out enough about

00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,620
the project in order to make a scope of

00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,090
work that has a price

00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,410
if you don't know enough about the

00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,720
project then you step back and do a

00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:55,310
discovery phase which has a scope of

00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,050
these questions we're gonna get answered

00:56:55,310 --> 00:57:03,260
some of those answers now we can build

00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:04,820
another proposal for the next part yeah

00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,450
I'll be here if you guys have questions

00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,450
