Description: 
	WordPress is a powerful tool to help businesses and community organizations of any size communicate with the people they wish to serve. But having a website is not enough. Instead of using a website solely as a catalog or sales brochure that focuses only on your products and services, website owners should turn the spotlight on to their customers, who are searching online for information that helps them solve business and personal challenges. WordPress, because it’s so accessible to users of all skill levels, is the perfect platform for businesses and groups to regularly share insights and how-to details that their end-users crave. In this session, you will learn about five ways to use WordPress and third-party plugins that make it easier for you to publish more articles, infographics, photos and videos that meet your audience’s information needs.
