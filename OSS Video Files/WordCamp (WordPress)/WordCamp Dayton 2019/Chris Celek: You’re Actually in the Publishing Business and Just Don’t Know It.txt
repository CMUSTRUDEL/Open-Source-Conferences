Title: Chris Celek: You’re Actually in the Publishing Business and Just Don’t Know It
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Dayton 2019
Description: 
	WordPress is a powerful tool to help businesses and community organizations of any size communicate with the people they wish to serve. But having a website is not enough. Instead of using a website solely as a catalog or sales brochure that focuses only on your products and services, website owners should turn the spotlight on to their customers, who are searching online for information that helps them solve business and personal challenges. WordPress, because it’s so accessible to users of all skill levels, is the perfect platform for businesses and groups to regularly share insights and how-to details that their end-users crave. In this session, you will learn about five ways to use WordPress and third-party plugins that make it easier for you to publish more articles, infographics, photos and videos that meet your audience’s information needs.

00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,790

actual you do the construction of the

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,480
design so

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,660
okay

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,230
a lot of my clients are b2b in pharma or

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,760
an aerospace engineering

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,430
they have very demanding requirements

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,640
for tolerances and cleanliness

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,550
they want the information so while the

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,890
people I work for make all of this very

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,319
sophisticated equipment when I talk with

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,160
them to you guys not designing machine

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,470
tools and pharmaceutical diagnostic

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,300
systems you're publishing you got to

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,280
share that information in a way but the

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,970
engineers can consume so that they spec

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,970
your equipment

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,720
you're vlogging

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:24,210
you definitely are a publisher yeah and

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,039
use WordPress already okay we're gonna

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,870
talk a little bit about how WordPress is

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:32,520
still true to which weeks as a blogging

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,560
platform where it started much more

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,949
robust than that but some of the things

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm going to talk about really go to the

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,139
foundation of the best a blogging tool

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,650
anybody else want to share with their

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,650
businesses

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,430
to find old vehicles

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,250
so those are basically one two four and

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,790
eight horsepower vehicles and exactly

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,000
that's really bad bad humor I'm sorry

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,390
okay

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,940
all right well I come from the

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:27,030
traditional publishing world newspapers

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,890
and and older media and so when people

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,330
discover that oh you know about

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,160
publishing and after I started having to

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,120
answer those kinds of comments a couple

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,780
times it dawned on me that yeah I came

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,240
from the publishing world but that what

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,110
all of us do every day or need to be

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,360
doing is publishing and sharing our

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,980
information because it doesn't matter

00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:02,620
how good we are at selling old vehicle

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:06,910
or static free clean rooms or providing

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,420
financial literacy information that what

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,130
we're we're gonna have more success and

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,690
the people we're trying to serve are

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,100
gonna be much happier and they're

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,520
probably gonna come back and pay us more

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,490
if we meet their needs we help them

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,680
solve their problems by sharing what we

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:29,880
know so I start from well it looks like

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm not gonna start at all am I

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:44,120
I started from the premise that there

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:47,300
are ways to use WordPress that move us

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,849
from all the other discussions that

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,029
you've heard so far at workout which is

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,710
about how to set up a wordpress site how

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:59,990
to add functionality through flood

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:06,979
plugin how to modify or create custom

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:09,139
codes - this is applied WordPress how

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,729
are we going to run our businesses how

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,129
are we going to make money and

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,479
importantly how are we going to do it in

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,120
a way so it's easy

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,389
WordPress is supposed to be easy and on

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,400
many levels your business well there are

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,120
so many other levels in which it really

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
is easy

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:34,870
and here's why this is important most

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,510
people remember I'm I started out as a

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,430
writer and editor and every time I hear

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,650
myself saying what I'm about to say I

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:47,850
can't believe that a word guy is saying

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:54,970
this people respond online and in print

00:07:47,850 --> 00:08:00,040
to what they see I can write a 3,000

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:02,320
word ebook white paper that beautifully

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,190
explains the latest technology and

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,950
static free clean rooms right engineers

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,950
on a lap up everything they write I've

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,110
shown pictures of the design and the

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:26,140
construction of the operation of a

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:28,270
static click on it and they you why more

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,140
than half the people believe what they

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:38,380
see so what does that mean for the way

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,720
we use our our website there's something

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,390
a long time being a writer in a news

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,640
reporter and later an editor to figure

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,980
out it's a lot more effective to show

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,340
how is it effective nobody in here said

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,470
that they run a cake cupcake bakery

00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:01,640
anybody okay

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,010
if you show on your WordPress website

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,190
this image up in the hero space on the

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,590
home page some we can stop and look at

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,900
the kind of cupcakes you're offering or

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,150
if you have close-ups of the way you

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,310
decorate cupcakes and I guarantee you

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,990
you're gonna get more traction than if

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,030
you just write about it if you run a

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,570
machine shop you're a manufacturer

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,860
you're an auto mechanic shop and you

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:32,880
show how you make something how your

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,020
tools work how you fix things that's way

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,200
more compelling than anything I can find

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,150
here a DUI lawyer just put your phone

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,370
number in this photo on the top of your

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,110
website right everybody who's just been

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,510
arrested for drunken driving it's gonna

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:56,670
call you so how do you do that visual

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,870
presentation in was that well folks are

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,640
brand new to WordPress

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:05,400
Savion on the 101 staff okay so full of

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,140
points are really for your benefit for

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,060
those of you who are more experienced

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,500
with WordPress bear with us we're gonna

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,580
get to some other things that hopefully

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,400
will be new

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,320
but inside the WordPress dashboard you

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,810
learned yesterday that there's a media

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,450
library you can upload all kinds of

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:28,280
image files right photo files in JPEG

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:32,380
and graphics files in PNG format you can

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,490
upload PDFs all kinds of visual assets

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,190
you upload them in there you're gonna

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:43,070
have a directory that looks like this

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:46,900
and I'm going to show you how I use this

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:51,290
photo which is a really unattractive

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,060
sleeping guy photo on behalf of an

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,560
insurance agent this is a local

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,530
insurance agent selling health insurance

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,320
can we upload the photo the next step

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,170
this is all for those of you who are new

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,990
to WordPress this is all onboard

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:14,300
technology in WordPress you upload the

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:18,710
photo you have for each image file you

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,830
have this level of information and this

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,140
is where paying attention to the

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,870
capability that WordPress offers us for

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,210
publishing it's critical to your success

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:34,010
in getting the attention of customers in

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:38,660
profit for each image you want to have a

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,340
fine line and we're gonna talk about

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,320
this filename in a second this filename

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,330
is ridiculously long it's full of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,190
numbers and characters makes absolutely

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:51,770
no sense it's in there intentionally we

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,300
also have something called alt text and

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:59,870
we have a description and we also have

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,990
in this view we have a link to the

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,450
actual in this case blog post on this

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,810
insurance agent site where this is

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,360
displayed with the word

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,009
why is any of this important why do you

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,490
want to pay attention to after you've

00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:18,670
uploaded your image or won this file

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,910
name completed can cam convey

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,430
information to Google about the topic

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,300
and about the relevance of the photo

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:31,360
Google search can't see images you can't

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,459
see a picture when they're scanning

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,290
sites but what they can't see is the

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:41,439
text around this file name really needs

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,309
to be something that's in English in

00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:47,220
simple words like sick guy with flu you

00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:50,589
know you're gonna see this guy in a semi

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,389
not those characters that are generated

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,600
when the photo was created by the camera

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:59,620
so change that when you're uploading it

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,519
or change it here in the Edit data

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:07,620
coming change it to in this case sick

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,620
guy with blue dot JPEG Oh

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:16,910
anybody not know what all tuffsy yeah

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,740
yeah if we go to edit more details

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,600
you're able to change it inside

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:26,629
WordPress yes I'll test it is

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,619
alternative text really important for

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:34,519
search it might be displayed but Google

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:37,550
can see it and if you have put certain

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:42,350
keywords in there for example flu

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:44,179
influenza health insurance okay this one

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,119
says photo of man with flu illness

00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:49,240
health insurance from and then the name

00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:51,980
of the insurance agency Neely and Wade

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,230
insurance Winchester and Lexington

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,759
Kentucky

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,480
that information is first and foremost

00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,879
important for Google and Google will use

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,639
that information along with the words in

00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:09,410
the blog post to determine how relevant

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:12,139
your information is to this what this

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,059
the searcher the customer has typed in

00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:15,709
and I'm going to show you how that works

00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:19,189
in a second does that make sense

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:23,480
I mean what alt text many people don't

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:26,269
use alt text this is critical to help

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,449
Google find your information and put it

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:33,559
in front of customers so if we were

00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:35,480
alive and I clicked on this link that's

00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,389
actually the title of the blog article

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,920
which was a machine that actually we're

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,300
not saying that next we're seeing

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,730
Google's search results so I typed in

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,910
get a flu shot

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:51,920
avoid winter willness illness and then

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,269
Winchester Kentucky and I typed in

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,370
Winchester Kentucky because I was

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,519
sitting in Cincinnati when I put this

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,049
slide back together but if I were in

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,049
Winchester Google would already know

00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:06,189
that I was in Winchester Kentucky and it

00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:08,689
would pull in as relevant information

00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:11,149
information from websites that's near me

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,620
in this case in Winchester Kentucky or

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,340
in Dayton Ohio

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,950
you're sitting when the search what did

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,340
it show me well it showed me information

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,920
about flu shot illness in Winchester

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,760
Kentucky the location what's the first

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,140
thing there's really bad photo of guy

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,500
who's not feeling really well right

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,330
that's sitting on my clients website

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,660
underneath it what does it say get a flu

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,060
shot

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,450
to avoid minor illness that's the title

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,290
from the blog post that Google read

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,240
Google matched up the words in the title

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,030
Google also doesn't display it and say

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,310
that the Google also matched up the the

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,500
words that were in the alternative text

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,500
the alt text block

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:20,939
it depends on the the Terms of Service

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:24,519
or the license that the photo provider

00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:29,189
granted to you and that's really the

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:32,379
point is to if you're obtaining images

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:34,860
online and you're using those from a

00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:38,079
free site or those that are providing a

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,579
common use license you have to really be

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,459
aware of the Terms of Use

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,889
okay and some of them may very

00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,839
specifically say that you can't change

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,420
like the source of where this came from

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,999
or they may say that you can't change

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,949
the file name okay you need to be aware

00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:56,290
of the term if you're if you're buying

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,720
in that photo and a lot of the photos I

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,279
use came from Adobe stock which is a

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,100
paid service I think it costs me like

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,250
$32 a month or almost unlimited access

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,500
and their licensing is very liberal in

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,289
terms of how we can reuse the images

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:20,520
including changing who it's attributed

00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:20,520
to and where we publicly depends

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:30,260
now the other thing to notice here and

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:32,900
this photo on my clients website the URL

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,690
for the website is right here it's

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,000
number one in Google search around we

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:49,280
have to pay for that just based on the

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:51,799
way they click on that photo that's what

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,760
takes them to the insurance website this

00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:58,720
is a blog post using the post publishing

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,320
tools that are standard inside WordPress

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,320
once you set it up you can set up a blog

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,010
post like this you can write your hearts

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,330
yeah

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm a writer I write to my hurt to that

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,460
publish always publish with a photo why

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,039
people are more likely to thirds of them

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,220
are more likely to click on and open

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,710
something click on and follow the call

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:28,270
to action button because of the image

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,669
first the image came up in Google search

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,490
not the word doesn't happen every time

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,500
but it happens probably eight or nine

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,500
times out of ten in Google search that

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,990
the image will be displayed in Google

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,260
search not the words and that's really

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,840
important to know every blog post

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,440
there's also applies to things that you

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,770
care on social platform having an image

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,010
and astronomy will get your readers to

00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:00,190
click through what we write right hand

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,190
back

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:12,790
if in this case I suspect and Google

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,670
doesn't say specifically what their

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:19,150
criteria are and in what order but I

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:23,680
suspect because in that alt text field I

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:26,290
had typed in flu and illness and health

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,990
insurance and then my search and yeah I

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,010
already knew the keywords but you know

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,040
if somebody were searching for

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,810
information or about flu or they were

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,550
searching for information about health

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:46,030
insurance we're gonna type in those

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:47,950
specific words no no no and we're gonna

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:54,070
get back to captions in a second so hold

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:59,680
that thought okay this is related in no

00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:02,440
small part to the alt text box okay it

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,140
is located when you go to upload a photo

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,930
as the photo comes into the WordPress

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,730
directory there will be fields that you

00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,360
can fill out there I think there on the

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,650
right-hand side of the window you can

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,480
the question was can you change the file

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,730
name you can change the file name at

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,980
that point you can add in the caption

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,920
we're going to talk about captions you

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,910
can add in the alt text you can also add

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,910
in a description

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:40,350
yes so again hold up the question about

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,990
Katherine if the alt text that is

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,180
important to help influence or try to

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,020
influence Google search rank because

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,420
that description won't be seen publicly

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,520
but Google will see it so whatever your

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,240
keywords are about your product or

00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,230
service importantly your location what

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,970
city is your business in what cities

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,860
describe the footprint for your business

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,060
you know how far out do you get your car

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:12,720
or truck to go take care of a customer

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:17,010
listing that area Dayton Ohio Winchester

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,590
Kentucky okay that helps Google figure

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:23,070
out that oh this person's selling health

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:27,570
insurance in Winchester is close to the

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,910
searcher okay if if I had these typed in

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,020
Winchester Kentucky specifically it

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,380
would have given these search results

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,260
for health insurance information in the

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,860
Cincinnati area that's where I was when

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,860
