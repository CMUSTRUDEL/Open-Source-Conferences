plan it happens

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,770

minimize that who's ever gotten

00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:11,630

creative space the student client paid

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,460
some work we're doing fine facing work

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,899
here also in sales they don't really

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,410
tell you that when you sign up to the

00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,630
job

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,040
or you become a freelancer we're getting

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,310
here you're dead but all sudden have

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,630
some talking clients party else has been

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,460
able to communicate with the client I

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,540
understand that you movies and how to

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,369
best help them that's a part of working

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,030
a client facing position is being able

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,830
to translate jargon but can also mean

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,590
translating what they're telling you to

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,790
your technical team you have that client

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,740
listed I'll just do that

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,299
Tina just fixed a little with it and

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,549
then you have to figure out what they're

00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,570
actually saying either you're doing the

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:03,100
work and you're translating

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,100
we need to translate it to somebody else

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,830
what my clients told me in that when

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
typically that typically when she talks

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,760
to techies as she put it she feels like

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,720
they talk at her and said to her and

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,290
it's a kind of asked her what do you

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,360
need

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,820
she said wall times there's talking and

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,680
jargon little technical talk I kind of

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,050
leave that meeting with my eyes glazed

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,480
over and I feel like I have no idea what

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,480
they just said to me that's not a good

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,610
feeling pretty like part of the client

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,530
communication is taking the customer on

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,620
the journey with you and making them

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,870
feel included so that's when the number

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,430
one reasons why you're translating so

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,610
they don't think that okay remove this

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,050
website for unit for this reason today I

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,390
wanna share some tips in clinic

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,760
communication and translating tech talk

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,310
or jargon into easier terms of your

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,720
clients all understand the thing to

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:05,780
remember is that people do business

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:08,900
people they know like and trust so boom

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm my name is Mitch brick and she said

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,140
she said I don't believe media a little

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,870
way they came to see us the Bellingham

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,390
we focus on being helping businesses and

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,549
agenda process so they don't have to do

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,680
it a lot of big a lot of businesses are

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,380
very busy so I'm trying to take that off

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,690
their plate and you can see that I chose

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,760
like some others they just use a picture

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,769
of themselves I actually chose a picture

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,010
of my wife and I'm I did this because of

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,900
that for support

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,569
we would not be inspired living today

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,000
meeting those creatives have significant

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,680
others that we don't necessarily think

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,349
that they are a part of the business

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,599
well when they're supporting us in our

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,790
journey they really are part of business

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,209
just because they're not writing code

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:58,610
writing content designing doesn't mean

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,220
they're not holiness I spend many years

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:06,329
at the college working in just basic

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,970
HTML CSS sites a client wanted to make

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:12,150
this little change one day all of us was

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,560
up eating business hours and said okay

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,959
well that's something something at that

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,660
time we can do really quickly so I said

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,789
I can get to that the next day this

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,350
really was not very convenient for the

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,210
client or the tasks they weren't even

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,870
done because they needed to change those

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,070
hours and make it easy

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,960
after this it started looking for a

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,990
solution that would be more client

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,210
friendly so that I can have them do some

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,669
of these small tasks like maybe change a

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,930
picture change of business hours or

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,320
change your head of a little piece of

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,470
common work content

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:50,310
after spending a small frustrating spin

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,000
- jimana i found WordPress and I've

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,570
never looked back since the last part of

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,590
my journey to get here well this is

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,020
working a full-time job

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,870
well it's building up a business a lot

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,430
of us have to do that this year I was

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,979
able to transition out of that Dean job

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,660
and work a full whole time uncle by

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:14,099
media so if you're on this journey and

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,910
you you're going to get frustrated

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,570
you're

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,280
burnt out but the build drive if you are

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,660
on this journey is to keep going because

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,730
one day you are going to find that

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,730
freedom of your schedule in your time

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,250
okay so I found as those between this

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,620
presentation together min promise quote

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,500
and it was perfect speak to your

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,060
audience in their language about what's

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,400
in their heart by Jonathan Lester one of

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,410
the best ways to get through to a

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,300
potential client or even a current

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,610
client is speaking their language

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,870
this isn't obvious obviously have to

00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,820
always being English you could be in

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,530
their native language but it's also

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,420
really just pulling them down seeing

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,920
understanding we're talking about you

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,110
know I'm not talking them you know all

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,620
this is a PHP your CSS with them with

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,790
that I'm really making a tired friendly

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,510
this helped keep everyone on the same

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:17,460
page it also helps with buying it if

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,340
you're trying to sell to somebody and

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,650
they don't know what they're buying but

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,770
the next person that they are talking to

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,120
the other web ABC is translating okay I

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,220
know exactly where I'm buying and they

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,820
feel that relationship so that's another

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,130
part of this communication so you don't

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,300
if you can't communicate for them how

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,250
you're gonna know what their goals are

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,250
or even how to communicate with them

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,800
then share some tips on it on everything

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:58,400
from web terms to translate and also

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,930
some of the ones not translate we also

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,570
cover some features of the website of

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:06,860
built and some examples of those

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,530
translations I will also share some tips

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,810
about processes that make everyone's

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,190
life easier

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,030
lastly we will cover some aspects of

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,720
meetings proposal and even some tools to

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,720
help you along the way

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:28,430
so that's creative we run into a pitfall

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:32,780
a lot of times we let the client steer

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:36,200
the ship and I've ever been on that ship

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,990
when it hit rocks but there's not other

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,580
times you can get scope creep or even

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,310
get to a bad point of the relationship

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,280
where they either just want to quit or

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,980
you know go find somebody else so we're

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,870
the captain of the ship it is our job to

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,150
make sure we don't run into rocks and

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,150
sometimes it's creative see kind of it's

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,580
tough for us to stand our ground and say

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:04,400
this is the process this is what works

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,960
and this is what we're gonna do so I was

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,390
saying if you let the client see the

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,290
ships you're gonna drop so trying to

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,820
avoid that does this mean don't build a

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,110
solution the client is asking you to

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,730
build you know this means that step it's

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,510
stepping in when the client has a bad

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,450
idea

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:27,160
such as the usual inspires on your

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:30,740
website there are times for sliders yes

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,500
but metrics do show that slider

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,419
determine the best day in the world and

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,729
things slow down your website so some

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,060
kind of identifier that's really

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm slider and it's our job to educate

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,069
them why I was not at that idea you know

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,110
to say I'm not doing that that's a

00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:51,050
horrible idea and say I'm not doing that

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,420
because and then show them even

00:08:51,050 --> 00:09:02,750
sometimes meet you children article and

00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:05,720
do that it's also explaining so we're as

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,360
weird as for our job we're the to regard

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,290
of guiding them through this WordPress

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,439
wilderness

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,509
if the Tina wire turns it goes and try

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:17,779
to build a website on WordPress it's

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:20,089
kind of overwhelming you have all these

00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:28,459
different options it's our job to guide

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:31,160
them through the darkness so a lot of

00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:34,459
times the client asks us to do certain

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,250
things maybe like a certain piece of

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:40,730
post any you know a certain tool or

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,300
something like that I using the example

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,430
of do you go to the mechanic who's 15/15

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,009
your car and ask them to use a very

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:53,740
specific wrench when working on your car

00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:57,139
you know you are paying them in a shop

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,660
for their process which includes the

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,880
tools that they use so don't be afraid

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,040
when you're doing infantile or anything

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,769
that there's certain tool if there's a

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,189
certain post income to be anyway or a

00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:13,990
certain theme or certain plugins you

00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:13,990
know that is part of your process

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,420
there are many parts of the website

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,750
build that we should translate to the

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,870
client feels included some of these

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,790
elements are vital to the success of the

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,400
project

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,050
number one is hosting I don't know if

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,530
you've experienced lots of different

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,540
posts out there but it is treacherous

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,640
there are times where it can go

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,250
perfectly great and there's times you

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,360
want to pull your hair out the best

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,040
thing when you run into those situations

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,180
the ones that blow your hair out you

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,550
never want to do business with them

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,800
again and if the client says I want to

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,680
use this company to say sorry I don't do

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,700
business with that and then if dig their

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,330
heels in it might be a red flag of not

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,660
work with that client it is okay to say

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:10,110
no to class so that's okay to say no to

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,250
turn on the job because you can in a

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,250
whole world of heartache

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,660
[Music]

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,600
Hosting is one of those things that we

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,209
do have to translate because many times

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,999
we're not lucky enough to get them

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:33,029
without hosting you get that client oh I

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:36,600
already got GoDaddy like that destiny

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,980
like this so you need to either educate

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,290
them on keeping them in that in that

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,209
environment or moving them into your

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,699
environment but you have to give a

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,079
reason you can't just say oh that thing

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,870
that you just paid for we're not using

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,699
so you have to explain why you use you

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,379
know for example I used by of it you

00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:55,699
know I think by Bill Gates as part of

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:58,800
the process this is part of the package

00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:01,259
but someone asked what it is I typically

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,589
say hosting is where every website lives

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:07,319
and what makes it run and then if it's

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,860
not that a solid it is down to either

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:14,309
fail or something bad will happen I have

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,160
recovered many have studies on certain

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,930
specific hosting companies inside

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,579
decided not to business to him and I

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,089
explained that to them for me I handle

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:29,879
the hosting as part of the package it is

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,199
a build plus support so I kind of take

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,449
that out of the conversation a little

00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:37,800
bit say hey I'm here to take care of

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:40,949
that for you this has helped immensely

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,779
reduce the problems that involves

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,029
dealing with multiple different hosts

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,920
it's gonna have to figure out what each

00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,500
of the backends look like how it's all

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,950
new on

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:58,210
are and everything the sooner that you

00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,100
move to a process where you're always on

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,570
one environment in more in your life

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,040
it's going to be better and you're going

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,350
to be able to communicate that with your

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,030
client easier and you're going to spend

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,790
less time on some of those kind of

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:16,180
menial tasks so try and get a host into

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:18,220
work everyone has home preference so if

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,070
you ever get on you know Facebook

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,500
Twitter your slide whatever any asks

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:27,100
what's the best hosting you're gonna get

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,190
about a million or twice so don't worry

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,060
about that a lot of times it takes

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,660
experimenting what that posting and

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:39,130
seeing if it works with your workflow

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:42,010
don't need registrar sometimes you get

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,560
to a point where you have that client

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,900
that has an idea but they don't have a

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,170
domain so it sounds you have to go and

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,900
kind of find that for them so you talk

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,730
about it domain registrar typically say

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,480
you're basically painting from the right

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,300
for that domain or calm anything for

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,970
yearly another part when I talk about

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:08,470
domains is always by who is privacy

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,380
because if you don't you were bound to

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,970
get at least 100 emails and at least a

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,710
couple hundred phone calls because

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,200
people see these lists of these new

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,930
domain names they say oh you're building

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,460
a new website you want my hump and they

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,050
will so and when you don't do you don't

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,590
even privacy like you can go and look up

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,060
this calm you can see

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,150
this is who you are this is where you

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,960
lived and this is your phone number I'm

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:38,270
pretty sure you don't want that

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:41,870
information not allow custom email

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,460
addresses I talked about this just as I

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,800
talk about the whole spectrum of things

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,360
but we're definitely in an age where

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:54,350
having that at gmail.com or Outlook or

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,020
hotmail or MSN and Yahoo is not very

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,370
professional are you gonna want to do

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,410
with somebody to business with somebody

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,800
that emails you Yahoo where'd you know

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:06,290
less lately if you don't know that it's

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,060
a respect factor there's a lot of spammy

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,490
going on right now you know email

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,100
hacking and thank you so people look at

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:19,670
that really closely right now you know

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:21,470
is this real so having a branded email

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,960
address you know there's a you know big

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,060
respect factor it sent easier than ever

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,790
to do it

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,840
and I still prefer office 365 you know

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,970
just because I like heaven here

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:37,940
everything under one roof but that's

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:41,840
just my preference SEO the big big

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:45,170
buzzword here nowadays clients are

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,470
asking more and more and more about SEO

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,990
as they hear it they create a lot of

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,240
times in it and it's saying it's

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,050
optimizing your website and marketing

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,700
efforts to be found on Google and then I

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,520
try to explain to them that there's no

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,930
magic bullet sometimes they to say oh

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,050
you're just going to get my other side

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,120
of a number one yeah it's not just you

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:12,410
know this and put my red shirt you know

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,270
fingers but I'm gonna dive too much into

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,100
that Roberts actually that multiple

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:22,790
talks this weekend on the topic Google

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,360
Analytics you may not get clients asking

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,690
about it

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,400
but it's a good thing to talk about

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,810
because how you're going to know that

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,160
something is successful unless your

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,150
measure

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,550
and so a lot of times I explained ok I'm

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,320
going to be sending you a report monthly

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,820
and I'll even grab a sample report and

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,280
kind of go through what these things

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,040
mean you know the bounce rates the

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,390
visits you know things like that so you

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,390
can actually measure them the other day

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,570
they're definitely in the beasting terms

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,700
that are best not to translate or even

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,580
bring up because you might look like

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,410
this woman on the left you might look

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,060
across the table at your client and they

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:11,380
look frustrated their eyes are glazed

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,630
over and they're lost you do not want to

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,280
be in that situation so there's things

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:23,560
like PHP and the song web services HTML

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,910
CSS maybe even specific plugins they

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,180
don't need to know that you're using

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,060
gravity forms they need to know if you

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:35,320
can top the site how to use it but

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,870
that's not a very important it is our

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,120
job that helped them but not overload

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,760
them I think the biggest thing that

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,530
sometimes we forget no matter what we're

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,200
doing whether it's social media website

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,760
is whatever that a lot of times the

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,530
clients who are helping it try the first

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,040
time and they've asked for help for this

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,320
and they're going to be overwhelmed

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,050
so sometimes it's best to kind of slow

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,700
down and kind of maybe even have

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,130
multiple meetings so they don't get

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,420
burnt out so fine you know why they

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,160
don't want to hire it if they're just in

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:13,180
for a job frustrated and I feel

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:15,280
go take a nap after talking via mean

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,650
they're talking to the clients for even

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,930
putting together proposal there's going

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,020
to be a list of features they didn't go

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,670
into the scope of work and we already

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,030
talked about in this last talk a little

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:31,570
bit about content management systems so

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:34,270
CMS or content management system when I

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:37,420
talk to client I'd say it makes it

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,220
easier for you to edit your site I have

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,500
many clients right now that we're moving

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,340
that to WordPress just made their life

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,650
easier

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,140
they can have you know maybe it was

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,090
Joomla maybe it was another CMS and

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,190
they're just frustrated because they

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,740
can't do it or it's too frustrating for

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,010
that I like to say once the site is

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,410
built it'll be just as easy to edit as a

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,930
word document because most of them have

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:07,810
used Microsoft Word or something here

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:10,390
there and then an aspect of the CMS tips

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,960
pointing were talking appliance then it

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:17,170
is a piece of software with apps or in

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,140
this case plugins that need to be kept

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:23,170
up to date I would use an example of

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,630
everything go use your Facebook app on

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,390
your phone and it doesn't work in any

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,090
real and it needs to be updated

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh works now well it's the same thing

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,850
with a wordpress site except it's even

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,070
more extreme that's your business

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:41,590
actually talk to a company about

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,860
WordPress meetup very big funky in our

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,350
community their design team read and

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,410
update and run broke the website for

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,600
four hours for some businesses that's

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,149
not a big deal for this business if I

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,679
lost

00:19:54,149 --> 00:20:02,479
there's an opportunity and that's where

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:06,209
daily backups come in and part of that I

00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:08,329
was a big fan of daily backups they're

00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:10,889
an insurance policy or peace of mind

00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:12,839
that's in case something happens to the

00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:17,039
website that it can't come back to the

00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:19,409
next state daily backups and so when I'm

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,689
explaining to a client I say DV backups

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:24,469
take copy of your website it's in case

00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,469
something happens

00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:34,019
this isn't talked about much but

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:38,099
displaying reviews reviews are very

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:41,399
important as a trust factor when

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,109
choosing who to do business with so a

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,159
lot of times when I'm pumping the time I

00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,619
want to see if they have any

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,159
testimonials any Google reviews

00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:54,719
basically use Twitter anything any any

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,789
good pretty advanced and something I

00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:58,649
like to do and explain that okay we're

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,819
going to take and put this in an easy

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:04,529
place for your website visitors fine and

00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:09,739
help those potential customers in the

00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:14,549
buyer decision to leave capture point

00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:18,929
most contact forms that you see are name

00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:21,299
email phone number meeting contact well

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,980
if you have me come through

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,139
you know the father his email and his

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,279
phone and he just said help me please

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:31,139
is that very helpful no all you need to

00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,139
do is at least ask a couple of call

00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:38,220
unquestioned that minimum do you have a

00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:40,739
current website what you know what is it

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,360
what's calm or that.org or whatever it

00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:44,489
is you can actually look at it so when

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,340
you get that lean through you're more

00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:49,799
qualified the same goes with any type of

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,960
business and they get a lead in just a

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:56,460
bit of extra time and ask at least a

00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:01,830
couple of qualifying questions for me I

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:05,190
like to on lead forms and in an intake

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,440
form is ask some of the three major

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:11,190
goals to the project and maybe even

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,109
budget and I know that pricing you know

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,109
it's kind of oh we don't want to talk

00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:19,470
about that but sometimes it's good to

00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:21,629
feel at home if they have a budget if

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,779
they don't or even what that budget is

00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:28,830
because maybe you have a minimum and

00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:30,749
they're under that at home image

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,509
optimization is something that's a

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:36,629
little technical but it's good to talk

00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:38,070
to them about because sometimes people

00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:40,230
are taking pictures with their cell

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,889
phones even like oh this would be so

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,619
cool website and they don't realize how

00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:48,389
big those photos are and they do this

00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,690
every day and all of a sudden their

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:53,999
website is a 1520 second website and

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,480
they freak out and they call you as my

00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:59,669
website so slow well that's because they

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,679
were learning changes so part of that

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,609
education is saying yeah don't do that

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,190
or putting a name image optimization

00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,720
plug-in on there that can

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,229
optimization stealing or what have you

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,249
or maybe even say hey you send me those

00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:18,389
images I will optimize them and go about

00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,979
our business

00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:22,859
there's things within WordPress

00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:25,830
obviously we can take and resize it you

00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,619
know from 5,000 pixels back 1000 and or

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,609
what have you and maybe that's part of

00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,609
educational decline

00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:42,239
there's also some other features within

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:43,700
the website available and you know

00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:46,349
obviously we talked about content

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,559
internal links can be very very

00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:52,039
important whether it's an active button

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:56,070
that can just be a link to live in text

00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:59,009
but it's good to explain why that's

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,169
there and where it's going because a lot

00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,820
of times you get a fire that says well I

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,229
just want everything really easy to find

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,019
and they just want to throw it all in

00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:08,249
the menu or or all the homepage because

00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,039
they think there's no other way to get

00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:12,869
there so you have to kind of explain

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,609
that and kind of explain the flow and

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,590
you can even do a little chart for them

00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:17,570
this is how you get to the business

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,909
place

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:25,220
this is something that's relatively new

00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:26,909
but live chat is becoming even even more

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,239
important and we're getting used to

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:32,519
using it so kind of let them know that

00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:34,529
it allows website visitors to connect

00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,539
with you through a piece of

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,639
communication software similar to text

00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,840
messaging because there is an app on

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:42,179
your phone that you can use to

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,700
communicate with them and that can be

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:47,609
helpful you can even automate and do

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,859
certain you know questions or comments

00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:54,539
and get those answered right away for a

00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:56,669
customer donation button everyone smile

00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,220
I work with nonprofits and they're

00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:04,619
trying to find easier ways to collect

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:07,080
donations now a nonprofit can create

00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:10,090
their own donation pages and not rely as

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,289
much or heavily as

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,899
if you're interested in learning more

00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:17,419
about this go talk to give them the P

00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:18,980
there gave their sponsor here they're

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,230
one of my favorites when it comes to

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,200
donations you can do it all you can use

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:27,019
simply a donation form you go and it

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,730
takes about three four minutes and if s

00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,529
when all they have to do is type in

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,529
their name email address and donation

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,739
amount folks with PayPal and they can go

00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:40,159
they can start collecting donations I

00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:42,830
was gonna have to collect that 2.9% but

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,299
they're not losing twenty thirty forty

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:50,509
percent to some of those other options

00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:54,049
portfolio portfolio obviously something

00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:56,090
we uses creatives but it can be more

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,340
recent projects to working with the

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,100
construction company a lot of times they

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,629
don't think these things matter but if

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,279
you're going to go hire a contractor you

00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:07,519
want to know what they built and what

00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,200
they've worked on and so sometimes it's

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,899
hard to pry them information out of them

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,840
I have a current project right now that

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:17,739
we're 90% done but for the last three

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,149
months I'm waiting for them to give me

00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:23,509
projects and then will not launch

00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:25,159
without these progress on there so yes

00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:27,950
there are certain pieces of content they

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,059
can hang up a bit of they are very

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,289
important they can be simple the best

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,230
thing when you're having a portfolio

00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:39,350
recent projects any of these things is

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,720
to have a formula or recipe okay just do

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,029
one sentence and do you know for the

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:49,140
construction company it was a quick

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:50,940
overview of the project the budget

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,690
and the square footage and some of the

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,960
things that they did this was coming up

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:01,830
even more and more often is premium box

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,620
or brand applause we're finding that

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,000
people wanted to get more creative but

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,310
they're also wanting to make everything

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,640
match you know you don't want to have a

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:13,640
nice logo and all of these babies with

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,560
you may want to actually have whatever

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,450
that female font is or that type kit in

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,360
print and graphic designers and logo

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:30,120
designers are starting to use that as a

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,580
best practice and use that information

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,100
to the client or even you know I use Ted

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:43,500
kit whatever love us and the store biz

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:46,920
so it can be nice it's always good to

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,550
keep the process simple when working

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,860
with clients I found that it's going to

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,350
have a process and kind of terror paint

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,300
that every single time it's gonna

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,240
publicly communication but it's also

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:03,300
going to help the efficiency one of the

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,160
best decisions I made in my education so

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,460
far was going through the deadly

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,920
elevation blueprint course part of that

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,350
a lot of that was about processors you

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,790
know templates other things not talking

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:20,930
with clients proposals you have certain

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:24,300
imperative tasks like onboarding or

00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:26,960
certain questions or comment right and

00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,330
down have templates days of

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,429
even if it's in words or whatever just

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,750
anything copy and paste it because

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:37,370
you're going to get a lot of the same

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:40,220
questions reduce stress but simple your

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:43,070
process is to lower the stress working

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,649
for everybody you do not want to finish

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,529
your project and have a mind to say well

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:50,990
that just stressed me out you want to

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:53,210
have the one stage that was so easy

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,659
you did not rest me out and we got

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:59,210
everything we needed done with the

00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:01,760
process always good to tweak as you go

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,990
sometimes you don't have to read the

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,990
rhythm if you're working with a

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,299
construction company B might not go

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:10,970
through here's website worksheet or your

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:19,370
intake form whatever they may want a

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:21,620
little more fun time or hang the meeting

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,830
when you're meeting when to cut a client

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:28,490
for the first time the number one rule

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:30,230
is to listen in client meetings it's

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,820
always good to listen there's also good

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,510
to let them know that you have their

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:40,669
attention for me I like to take and

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:45,409
actually take my phone out and sit on

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:48,429
the table down so they see okay my phone

00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:51,590
I ring you have my attention

00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:54,470
take notes this is the biggest thing

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,919
with meetings if you go and do meetings

00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,980
it's tough to remember everything so

00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:04,760
take those notes but take them notes in

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,720
a language of the client so they can

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,230
repurpose the

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,910
later in proposal and meeting recaps and

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,210
things like that

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:17,650
at the end of the meeting I like to

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:21,560
repeat the main points can be the goals

00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,630
could be particular design I don't want

00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,370
to make sure that when I'm wrapping up

00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,260
those notes and putting in the proposal

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,780
that were on the same page there's no

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,580
surprises only kind of go out into the

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:36,890
wilderness it's always good to use those

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:44,270
notes and goals we have and that's the

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:45,980
top three goals the project here's some

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,860
example questions that I asked in

00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:51,130
meeting the potential client fairly

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,830
whenever this but what are your goals

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:58,040
after going to Dirk elevation blueprint

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:01,150
part of the park is what they call go by

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,130
their team part of this method is ask

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:09,980
what the top three goals of the project

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:13,150
are let that run through and then ask

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,890
which one is the most important and why

00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:19,130
so you know their number one of those

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,210
may be to be number one on the globe or

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,890
maybe it's just to make their life

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,730
easier and it may be easy to edit

00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:29,000
because their website is hard at it who

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,030
are your competitors it is always good

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,980
to know who their competitors are one

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,620
you might want to see in what they those

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,950
competitors are doing be able to also

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,480
want to know how they're ranking but the

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,540
client is going to tell you also about

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,260
design how they like the designs of

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,940
those competitor

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,040
websites maybe they're gonna tell you

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:54,799
flat-out when they eat of it and you

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:57,620
know not to do that what a bit but my

00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,130
favorite questions ask is how are you

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,530
imagine this the success this project

00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,160
some people might say oh so I can have a

00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,700
father

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,740
edit the website on to develop okay

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,980
maybe it's the whole event

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:16,370
okay that's and that's something to pay

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,410
attention to a lot because that's going

00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,330
to change the price of the website or

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:26,450
the project or social media or

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:28,460
everything sometimes this gets a little

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,350
technical that I do like to ask are

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,710
there any specific features you led to

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:36,590
the closure this is good because you

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:40,370
also get it in their language I'm going

00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:42,650
to say I wanted to do this really what

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,400
do you mean translated to make sure

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,400
they're on the same page

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,360
the proposal is probably one of the most

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,580
important parts of the process of the

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,280
planet obviously the first impression is

00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,500
the meeting but the proposal is very

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:05,660
important that's a either a landing the

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:08,660
job or not totally in Turkey notes from

00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,570
the meeting to translate any of those

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:14,419
features that you talked about include

00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,549
the scope of work make it digest one

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,559
easy to read you send them a 20-page

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:24,370
document their final intermediate but it

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:27,799
is so make it easy include your process

00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:30,500
so if you have a six-week process there

00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,000
in six different phases explain that to

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,970
that because they're gonna want to know

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,010
what's the ETA and the launch date what

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,370
they're going to need to do in that on

00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,520
their side of the fence

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,860
kind of client homework and that's part

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:50,670
of getting the buy-in to to show how

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:53,130
professionally live after covering all

00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,390
these tips treating patients there's

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:59,670
some tools that make my life easier

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,730
Evernote it's very very simple but it's

00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,309
a great piece of notetaking software

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,720
sometimes they tape then that client

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:10,100
meeting notes you might have been there

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,889
and then pop those into better folders

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:16,010
or anything and that working idea is the

00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:20,669
client I'll just pop those in there

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:24,210
better proposals is my puzzle separate

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:26,960
choice and as a media great templates so

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:35,429
you can spin up a proposal really fast

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:38,600
very easy interface content snare well

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,700
the hardest parts of gathering content

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,860
what type are can gather content if you

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,149
ever have these issues and almost all of

00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:52,500
us do check that out the other last two

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:56,460
a client for an active campaign final is

00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:00,920
a easy dashboard plugin an active

00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,920
campaign is an email marketing software

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,270
any questions

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:36,180
I think that the best it's part of the

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:41,010
conversation of starting to work with a

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:44,200
agency or military developer typically I

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:49,240
I would say most of us aren't really

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,860
necessarily charged for that son well if

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,560
I were looking at it that website is

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,990
trying to build and rebuilding it or to

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,360
be or something having to do that to

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:05,920
know what I can quote because it's hard

00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:07,930
to kind of Blanco that there will

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,940
definitely be some people that will

00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,790
charge for that hourly rate or things

00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,230
like that but that's a good - that kind

00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:17,620
of starting point under conversation

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,780
with a designer and developer and also

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,550
kind of TV and kind of biggest thing

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,250
with that I would say is get your ducks

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,590
in a row of what in paint and what do

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:34,000
you like the current situation so that

00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:36,460
you can help the person you were talking

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,440
about daily backups and it was wondering

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,870
which one did you use sure so I

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,500
personally have multiple layers of

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,320
backups

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:52,120
I used by those that has fact that's

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:55,930
what else to use manage WB because I'm

00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:01,300
managing many different websites as far

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:05,050
as a plugin I recommend both press is

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:11,710
it's a great one up traffic plus it's

00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:13,180
also a good one that updraft plus one

00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,610
thing I like about our traffic losses

00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,490
it's really

00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,170
to restore you know there's things like

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,430
back of betting other things but they're

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,430
not as easy to restore

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,659
[Music]

00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,970
yes yeah so it's good too and I was

00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,670
thinking there's it's good to do that

00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,340
but the reason I usually do that with

00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,690
some kinds of things that are an idea

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,100
that see them up in the clouds or

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,460
something that they're not ready for yet

00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,600
but it's good to do that so they know

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,100
the reason why I wanted putting these

00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,410
things in your proposals or even on

00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,120
communication back and forth so in case

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,610
you as the client go back oh I thought

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,700
this was a little bit I'm sorry it's not

00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,850
that but we can add it but it is good to

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,270
add things or things near propose to

00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,270
know what

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,320
