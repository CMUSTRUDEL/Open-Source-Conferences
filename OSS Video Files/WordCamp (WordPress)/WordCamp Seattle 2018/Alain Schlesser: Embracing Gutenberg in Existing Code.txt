Title: Alain Schlesser: Embracing Gutenberg in Existing Code
Publication date: 2020-04-09
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Gutenberg is a major change to how you will develop software for WordPress. It starts with the WordPress editor but is planned to slowly take over the entire admin interface.
If you already have existing plugin or theme code that you need to maintain and make ready for the upcoming Gutenberg update, you will probably face some architectural design challenges.
This talk will first provide an overview of the general concepts that govern development in the Gutenberg era, and then discuss the different tricks & techniques you can use to gradually move your existing code from here to there, in a clean transition.
