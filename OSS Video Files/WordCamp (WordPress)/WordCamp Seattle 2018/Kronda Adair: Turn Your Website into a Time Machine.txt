00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:51,110
marketing agency so I help primarily

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:53,210
service based business owners move out

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,660
of that both Easton fanon thing that

00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:01,640
happened and so I'm going to talk to you

00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:04,220
today about time-saving and so first why

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,859
are there puppies I'm a interest wife

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,229
one of the catalysts for this talk is

00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,570
that my wife and I have been in the

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:14,990
planning and you two you're been a two

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,759
year process to get a puppy and I knew

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,070
that when the puppy came I wasn't gonna

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,259
have a lot of time and these are

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,950
expensive so you need to make more money

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:29,619
so and because the puppies generally

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,619
so this was in mid August of this year

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:39,520
when we went to go visit the winner and

00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:41,320
there were four weeks or the one that

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:49,149
ended up being ours the little guy that

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:51,070
is on okay so looks like we're the

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,080
agenda I'm going to talk about the

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,869
number one thing they need for anything

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,189
that I'm about to tell you may even work

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,130
I'm going to talk about the field of the

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,840
play which is counter I'm gonna give you

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,539
some tips and some actions that you can

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,369
take to try that same same time your

00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,590
business and then we give you some tools

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,299
that will help you save time and then

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,870
they give you the opportunity to design

00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:15,730
your own action plan that's not good yep

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,410
cool all right

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,269
so the number one thing that's going to

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,090
determine whether you even get anything

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,819
out of this does anybody have a guess

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:28,690
our attitude your attitude pick out your

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,760
mindset right human beings always have

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,420
to feel and perform in accordance to

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,489
what we believe to be true about

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,780
ourselves and our there so a good

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,810
example of that is let's say you're

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,310
walking in the woods and you see

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,340
something and you hear something you see

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,500
it out of your eye that's a bear what's

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,690
gonna happen your heart rates gonna go

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,230
up you're probably gonna run which

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,549
probably shouldn't but all of this and

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,459
then later on you find out who is just a

00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:00,010
person in a bear suit does that matter

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:04,030
when you think it's a bear

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,870
hey so what you believe is paramount to

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,670
what you can achieve so we all have the

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,940
same amount of time as as these three

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:16,000
ladies does anybody know

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,920
the middle is Shonda Rhimes I think good

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,300
people know who Shonda Rhimes is if

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,730
you've ever watched television on a

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:30,340
Thursday night in the last eight or nine

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:31,990
years she's responsible for me happy but

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,840
we all know same amount of time to pass

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,100
these three leaves and so if there's

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,720
someone that you kind of look up to

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,890
who's more successful and you think oh I

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,440
can never do that

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,560
the reality is that they probably just

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,670
know something that you don't know or

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,980
they believe something better than what

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,390
you believe or they do something you're

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:55,330
not doing and those are all things that

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:58,120
we so some tips or some tools to work on

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,500
your mindset easier to do great books

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,190
that are gonna help you if you haven't

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,890
really thought about systems or become

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,420
aware of systems thinking in relation to

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,070
your business these are two great books

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,350
that I recommend the first one isn't

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,030
work the system by Sam carpenter you can

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,860
actually download the entire book for

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,130
free if you just go to work the system

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,500
calm and opt-in and the second book is

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,060
called run length is called clockwork

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,520
and it's designed their business to run

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,680
itself and it's by Mike Micallef who

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,300
also wrote several other great books but

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,630
profit first is one of my favorite ones

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,220
and I'm actually halfway through clock

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,130
that's brilliant

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,140
like his other stuff and will really

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,669
give you a leg up on thinking

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,970
differently about your business even if

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:45,250
you're a business appointment

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,960
okay the field of play we're talking

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,210
about time so the field of play is your

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,580
calendar and so what I want to do is

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,199
that

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,819
by et right now to take out of your

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,439
calendar whether that's a planner phone

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,150
your laptop whatever and what do you

00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,090
take out your calendar and I want you to

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,189
block off four hours in the next two

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,319
weeks to implement something that you

00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:05,419
learned here today and that could be if

00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,729
one four-hour block can be for whenever

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,830
lost whatever works for you so I'm going

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,830
to pause actually you all

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,710
what's that

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,840
give me the high sign if you're done

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,730
all right

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,400
oh the other thing I'm gonna say about

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,210
this actually before we move on is that

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:21,360
when you're taking in new information

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:22,860
because so my suggestion to you is to

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,680
implement something called just-in-time

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,630
learning where you really only take in

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,240
information that you need to do

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,760
something in the very near future and

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,290
that when you're about speaking that

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,730
information that you do this that you

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,500
that you understand in order to

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,870
implement and get the benefit of what

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,550
you learn you're gonna have to walk out

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,410
some time so if you just get in habit

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,290
two-month what's gonna greet me in the

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,090
answer your effectiveness okay so now I

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,340
want to talk about some tips and my

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,080
first tip is actually for service based

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,790
business owners and a special low for

00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,510
one is oh sorry I got myself

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,400
here's another tool for you auditing

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,840
your time and understanding where your

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,820
time is going right now is actually

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,610
paramount to being able to improve

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,170
whatever your situation is so if you

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,090
have a way to do that you have a time

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,640
tracking system already that's great if

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,400
you don't you can go to Carville and me

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,620
slash time back audit and then just give

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,480
you a spreadsheet starter that you can

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,660
do and what I want you to do is track

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,490
your time for these belief and when I do

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,980
this I literally just I have the Google

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,400
sheet I have it accessible in my phone

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,930
and every 15 minutes or 30 minutes max I

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,370
pull it up and say okay what everybody

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,289
been doing and start to understand where

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,319
are you spending

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,719
are you spending it on Twitter are you

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,249
spending it you know cleaning because

00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:48,020
that's your former procrastination and

00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:54,649
if that is your formal confirmation

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:57,050
let's talk you know understand him where

00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,639
you're going right now all right

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,180
tip number one stop having so many

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,699
coffee dates this is especially if you

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,710
are any kind of service based industry

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,499
where you know making money is directly

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,749
tied to spending your time you know

00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:13,219
people at a certain point especially if

00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:15,529
you start to get successful people want

00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,809
to know how do you do what you do or how

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,729
can I do what you do and oh you mean

00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,469
I've kind of buy you coffee and I pick

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:26,629
your brain which is gross by the way

00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:28,939
stop saying that the people who do this

00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,219
are most likely never going to become

00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,800
your clients and they're most likely not

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,029
going to act on the advice you give them

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,079
because it's free if people don't value

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:42,099
what they don't so you probably don't

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:45,319
need to be having so many targets

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,870
you should really spend 18 times 80% of

00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:52,600
your time on having conversations with

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:55,670
all by prospects and delight their minds

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,100
like if you're in the first five years

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,889
of your business or if you're not making

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:06,230
as much money as one of me then backward

00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:11,750
you should focus your tip number 3 stay

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,490
laser focused on your why why is that in

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,170
your business you probably got started

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,910
in business

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,279
because either you're making something

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,480
or you're good at something that people

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,190
are willing to pay you for and then at

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,779
some point the reality sinks then

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,420
there's all these other aspects to

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,670
running your business that either you're

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,639
not good at or you don't enjoy their

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,829
folks but they have to be done you can't

00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,269
not do bookkeeping accounting int not

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,279
view marketing you can't whatever it is

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,820
that's not missing it still has to be

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,010
done business and so you stay focused on

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,320
why this you're doing it it can motivate

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,149
you to push through and actually keep

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:57,329
those things some of the people I play

00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:59,350
today are considered sexy enough but

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:03,510
understanding why you're doing it will

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,940
help you push past those that resistance

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:09,970
tip number four is to be mere days and

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,680
chunkier tasks together this is a

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,010
concept that I learned from a guy named

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,010
Todd almond who is a brilliant

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,829
businessman and sports coach he spent 20

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,660
years coaching high performance athletes

00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,910
Olympic and professional athletes and

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,350
he's taken those principles that he uses

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,760
with exact weeks and translated into

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:34,480
business so I learned this from him and

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,810
when I heard it I was like of course of

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,730
course

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,070
why would we do this so this is like an

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,689
example marketing Mondays or client work

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,860
on Tuesdays or eating

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,649
relationships on you know building on

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,319
Thursdays what does that do for you well

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,689
it reduces your overload for making

00:10:49,319 --> 00:11:00,989
decisions straight you don't have to get

00:10:51,689 --> 00:11:02,819
up on Monday morning so like if someone

00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:05,249
says to me if someone does ask me for a

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,529
coffee date I won't think of anymore

00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,509
like I think about whether I want to say

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,089
yes or no or if the answer is yes then I

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:15,540
just say oh yeah and I send to you a

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:17,129
calendar that just has Thursdays just

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,350
has made some Thursday so that's my

00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:26,249
relationship building day and I don't

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:28,410
have to have that all right now we're

00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:31,769
getting interactions so this is one of

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,079
the things that some of you might drive

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,329
it on and you or not find fun it's not

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:44,639
really that fun but organizing your

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:46,889
files is super important why you're

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,439
trying to do a thing and you spend ten

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,929
minutes trying to find the image that

00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:57,149
you need for the social media post to do

00:11:51,929 --> 00:12:01,079
whatever that's time yeah and then those

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:03,749
things matter really quickly and so you

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,059
know at some point I just took three

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,179
solid weeks where I spent a chunk of

00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,829
each day just wrangling my file I had

00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,550
just been throwing things you know on

00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,860
the desktop and then when I

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,350
my desktop was meant yeah a cup holder

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,490
and calling like the dangers like it was

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,880
bad so it's been at that time and I made

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,830
my drop box just like Christine but now

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,360
when I can what I need to get my hands

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,380
on something I know exactly where it is

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,760
because majority foundation and somebody

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,530
asks me actually the last time air

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,450
presenters talk well how do you

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,490
organization organize your file so if

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,100
you go to Carville the Middletown flash

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,140
files there's actually a video and I

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,220
show the videos that we have a friend of

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,830
my past okay documenting your processes

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,230
this is another thing especially new ish

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,460
business owners do not think about and

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,140
they'll say things like well that's just

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,820
me

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,210
yes but it's not really just you it's

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,790
past you and present you and future you

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,970
and documentation is a love letter to

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,260
future you because you're going to go

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,270
back to a thing that you don't do very

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,740
often and you're like and you will have

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,020
written your sample of letter that says

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,760
hey here's a checklist I give you this

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,750
thing and you'll get it done much faster

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,740
and actually about 40 minutes ago and

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,990
it's been written into the stock I

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,460
realized I do all these little things

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,470
security for topic turn off my

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,780
notifications so you don't have to see

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,820
all my text from my wife coming in while

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,430
I'm giving this talk I think oh I don't

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,080
know process for that so the tool that

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,670
used for this is process Street there's

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,350
others out there but I spun up a new

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,880
process and they have a template floor

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:49,570
and I write down all the things that I

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:53,080
do you ready for talk like you're not so

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,080
checklists are all okay so let's take

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,840
that tools your website obviously we're

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,810
all here it's worth it's word camp you

00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,580
probably most of you have websites that

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,680
is a tool that you can actually use to

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:10,760
save time and so an example

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,940
that is this is one of my clients and

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,390
what they do is they shuttle people to

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,399
that new this trail runners about 24

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,080
miles on the trail they shuttle people

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,580
to the intimates they can hike back to

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,510
their car and how the previously

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,850
operated is just all by phone and email

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,649
so you could call them up and say I've

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,450
been coming on this day it makes it

00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,220
great you show up and you pay cash or

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:41,149
maybe you didn't show up and they would

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,240
lose that money and their previous

00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:46,970
website in my humble opinion didn't

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,190
really look the way it would inspire the

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,080
trust to get into a van with someone

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,580
who's going to take you somewhere

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,580
[Music]

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,840
so they were spending a lot of time

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,960
answering the same questions over and

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,470
over again by phone right now so we

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,690
created a new site for them and we gave

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,290
them some breathing right the trust

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,420
factor we gave them online booking this

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,520
huge people cannot just go on the web

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,010
site but they can actually do this book

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,640
right there and not greatly improves

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,380
their cash flow we gave them a huge FAQ

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,710
frequently asked questions because when

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,720
you hang Australis it's on the coast of

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:33,020
California and parts of that trailer

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,490
underwater twice a day from the tides so

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,080
you're like you can literally get swept

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,940
out of the sea so there's a lot of

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,070
preparation that goes into it so we give

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,870
them a huge FAQ that answers a lot of

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,850
those questions of like what do you have

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,080
to do before you do this right and you

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,330
know you need to get a permanent and all

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,860
those kinds of things and so one of the

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,770
things that hunter said to me about two

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,100
weeks after we launched is my firm has

00:15:51,770 --> 00:16:02,390
virtually stopped ringing great they

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:05,060
were getting more looking for content is

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,160
a really really useful tool in

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,720
time-saving so you understand the

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,080
introduction that one of my goal in life

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,310
is for the answer to almost every

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,910
question that someone asked me to be

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,380
linked my mom because they people ask me

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,460
the same questions over and over again

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,470
and so this is a screenshot from the

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,100
previous version of my website where I

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:32,329
did a 30-day challenge where I posted a

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,819
video every day I recorded and

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:40,560
and posted a blog with a video every day

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:43,749
for 30 days and I did that frustration

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,839
[Music]

00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:52,149
really is too hard okay let's see and

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,149
I'm not gonna lie like what's happening

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,319
life was happening while I was doing

00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:00,139
this challenge I was actually still

00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:05,449
finishing the production of an online

00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:07,579
course that I was creating we went to

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,699
Santa Fe to visit my father-in-law for

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,579
like five days leave them that I would

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,850
go walk around and make my video and

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:19,880
post it but the point is like priorities

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,679
straight so if you understand the value

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,990
of content then you make it a priority

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,209
to get done because it's gonna it's an

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,570
asset that you can then have in their

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,519
business and build on here are some of

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,380
the benefits of content it will

00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,620
establish you as an authority in your

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,190
niche you literally say that someone

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,680
wrote that book onto something

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,900
to mean like they're an expert and they

00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,730
know what they're talking about so

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,080
publishing gives you that authority you

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,640
can save time by answering frequently

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,950
asked questions like I talked about

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,540
before

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:56,880
it will save you from selling doesn't

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:59,970
even eat your feet sales yeah that's

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,350
super common so if you have contact you

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,470
can let your content do the selling for

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,690
you and at this point I literally have

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,610
people come to me you know to talk about

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,770
working together and they'll say things

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,570
like I feel like I already know you have

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,000
been watching your videos for the last

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,530
two hours alright and we have to sell

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,360
them they know what I'm about

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,850
because I've been publishing for the

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,740
last five years and really we just have

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:31,260
to establish what is their problem can i

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:33,600
all right it can allow you to filter

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,190
your leads so this is another important

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,950
thing you really want to let me talk to

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,480
you qualified prospects who could

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,400
actually do business with you so if they

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,590
don't have any money or if they're not

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,730
the right fit for your business you

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,150
don't want to waste your time with those

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,980
people and so everybody who wants to get

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,930
on my calendar actually has to fill out

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,930
an application first and it just tells

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,360
me a little bit about their business

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,510
oh geez but I know like is it really

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,070
worth spending you know 45 minutes or is

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,080
there some clear indicator they're like

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,970
well I can't believe and help them so

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,560
why waste time so that's something you

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,120
can implement one of the other

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,150
presenters to talk about attorneys

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,920
websites you know and everything is

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,880
attorneys like they build up in it and

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,620
they're very expensive and so I I

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,960
pitched this concept to an attorney one

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:27,320
time this guy's got a lit up okay so

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,330
other tools and actually making a

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,790
website is very very challenging for a

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,070
lot of people so I have a whole suite of

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,230
tools which I'll show you how to get

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,760
access to for how I actually create

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,130
websites penalties so one of them is

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,750
beaver builder and I don't know Bobby's

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,670
in this ring but Robbie from beaver

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,970
builders here and they're awesome and

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,890
it's a great like rocket fuel in terms

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,310
of getting your website up quickly so

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,030
they have a theme and they have a Emer

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,020
which means not just build you know

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,450
pages with drag-and-drop functionality

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,700
but you can actually build sections of

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,380
your theme with that dragon Gog and drop

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,880
functionality and you can use those

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,810
sections over and over like the header

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,870
and the footer and things like that

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:15,260
thrive themes calm they make WordPress

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:17,900
themes and conversion focused WordPress

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,870
plugins what does that mean converting

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,990
focus it means its tools that make it

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,030
easier to collect leads on your website

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,280
get people to opt-in for your email list

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,670
for instance tools that make it easy for

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,770
you to Amy test to put things so by that

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,300
I mean let's say you want to test a

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,200
landing

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,850
age and 1% of people are converting in

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,950
that living patient so you decide you

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,530
want to change the headline or the image

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,660
and see if that works better you can

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,390
literally spend up a copy of that page

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,070
and then send half the traffic to the

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,990
first week and half the traffic to the

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,360
second page and see which one works

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,160
better and using one of their tools you

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,670
can say hey I want to run this test for

00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,950
two weeks

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,210
or I want this many people to see this

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,060
and then I want you to keep the winner

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,960
automatically and you can do that whole

00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:11,470
process in 30 to 60 minutes so what have

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,960
you devoted in power week to constantly

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:18,190
testing your landing pages to constantly

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,540
improve your conversion rate so really

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,320
powerful tools heather has been

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,510
technology a CRM our customer

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,650
relationship manager it's just a tool

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,270
where you can collect all your leads

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,740
together and you can collect all the

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,530
information that you have about those

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,630
leads and so activecampaign is a tool

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:39,010
that I love for that and it's also an

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:41,380
email an email service provider so you

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,210
can do your CRM and you send your

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,210
subscriber your mouse with the single

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:51,190
password management you don't have to

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,690
raise your hands but I just know for a

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,580
fact from having talked to many people

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,060
in some of you in this room are using

00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,250
sticky notes to manage your passwords

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,400
you're using Excel spreadsheets to

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,140
manage your passwords you're using the

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,860
same password everywhere manage your

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:12,680
passwords that's very expensive and

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,670
so the way to actually have secure

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,110
passwords and to have diverse you know

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,480
he's a different password for everything

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,640
is to use a password manager and for

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,130
that I'll make one password there's

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,390
others out there there's a tweak that

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,010
they don't think it would scream shut up

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,380
that where I said I was gonna have one

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,530
password finis I think using their from

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,230
for a long time okay

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,550
online calendars raise your hand if

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,880
you've done the thing where you're like

00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:43,310
hey let's me see are you free this time

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,930
No okay what about raise your hand if

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,650
you've done that if that email dance

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,250
yeah Wow yes okay we don't have to do

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,200
that anymore

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,080
that problem is solved you can get it

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,110
online calendar like calendly or

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,350
schedule once and you can put your

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,000
availability in there and you can sync

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,670
it with your calendar either your

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,650
Outlook or your Google Calendar and so

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,240
then you can send people a link and it

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,650
will just show the near available times

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,910
and then they can look at their

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:16,430
available times when they can pick the

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:19,220
one that works for them done getting

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:22,600
things signed I didn't have this one in

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,730
there but I did a partnership with a

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,640
major travel related and tourists

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:31,880
organization and when it came to sign my

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,500
contract I set them off my client

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,640
version and they sent me back

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,100
a photo of the paper signed version so I

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,810
though then I put this in here so if you

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,300
need to get things fine like contracts

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,340
for those holes agreements there's

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,180
digital tools for that where you can

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,490
just send the agreements and

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,980
yeah have someone click a button to film

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,540
their signature and it's a perfectly

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,100
valid legal same signature

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,470
so hello sign that's a great one for

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:06,930
that and you can use it for free for up

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:11,910
to three signatures a month no they just

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:15,180
look at time yeah all right

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,800
show don't tell so has anybody here it's

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,950
like trying to work with maybe a

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,690
designer developer a client and you keep

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,030
trying to email them and explain what

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,340
you mean and they just don't get it

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:29,240
you're just missing each other so it's

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:33,240
super useful to be able to show somebody

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,330
and so tools that will allow you to just

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,940
quickly record your screen and you know

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,010
click through and show people how we do

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,870
things or where they should look for

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,020
certain thing can save you a huge amount

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:50,730
of time so when I use this cloud app and

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,860
I believe it's actually my automatic and

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,330
then there's another call to them which

00:24:52,860 --> 00:25:01,200
is free so a great tool and I use a lot

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,270
of my with my team and I'm using time

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,770
with my clients where I'm just like go

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,770
here and do this exact thing

00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:12,119
all right so I've talked about a lot of

00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,489
your tools a lot I asked a lot of

00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,289
services and your website doesn't live

00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:18,629
in a vacuum and so it's very very useful

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,029
you can't connect all these things

00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:23,039
together so there are a tool metal you

00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:24,749
could do that where you don't have to

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,909
learn the code in order to do that you

00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:28,249
connect your website for instance to

00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,619
activecampaign

00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:33,599
and so some of those tools are safe here

00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,389
or is that here I never know which to

00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:40,679
call it and has anyone heard of that one

00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:43,799
yeah so there's literally like a

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,869
thousand services on there and you can

00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,929
go and you say I want to collect connect

00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:51,450
activecampaign to WordPress or I want to

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,759
connect you know gravity forms to

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:58,109
something else whatever it is awesome

00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,089
awesome tool and then if you have if you

00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:01,950
have a business where you have leads you

00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,109
know you have you know maybe your CRM

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,969
and you're using different services kind

00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:07,859
of tracks and leads maybe of users and

00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:09,899
your website and you have people in

00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,339
activecampaign and some of them are

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,879
clients and some of they're not and he

00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:16,979
does think all this contact information

00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:19,169
then PI sync is a great tool for that

00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:21,419
specifically to help you sync your

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,029
contact information between different

00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,499
things like maybe your CRM or maybe

00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:27,830
somebody actually become the client and

00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,830
then you need

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,770
you can sync all that up I see

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,570
and one thing I like to mention to you

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,820
is that a lot of these things are

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,040
subscriptions which can start to add up

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:45,170
and so one thing you can do to mitigate

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:50,540
that is to go to you appSumo comm AAP ki

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:53,930
s um TOCOM and they basically curate

00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,360
deals for a lifetime subscriptions to

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,710
services like these so you know in

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:14,930
particular that you're looking for

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:24,140
something i don't think i've ever gone

00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:28,250
on the house automating repetitive tasks

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,020
this is like a huge one if you're you

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,670
can evaluate the things that you have to

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,500
do it over and over again the big one

00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:37,310
that comes up is social media and

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,630
posting on social media so if you think

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,190
about things things do go over and over

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,440
again there's often ways that you can on

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,270
me and joseline you haven't had your

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,710
talk better it's tomorrow okay so you go

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,430
to Jos one stock and she's going to talk

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,990
completely about automation but one of

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,030
the things that I use and love for this

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,330
is Co schedule and it's a Content

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,860
planning social media calendar that

00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,590
helps you collaborate with your team and

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,910
helps you schedule social media in

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:08,030
advance and it helps you actually reuse

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:11,270
that content and put it on a loop so if

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,740
you follow me on Twitter a lot of those

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,490
things that are tweeting out like old

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,020
blog post

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,340
I can't keep that content in front of

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,510
people the columns from Foucault

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,640
schedule text expanders now we're

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:26,120
getting into to a more personal a little

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,260
bit nerdy but text expander is a tool

00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,840
that will allow you to type a very short

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,360
shortcut and expand it into some longer

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,000
text so a few things in a straight

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,860
course if you're constantly misspelling

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,190
word like maintenance not saying that

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,780
it's the - stuff but you know there's

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,550
things that you commonly misspelled and

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,020
you can put the misspelling in the text

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,470
expander and then I will just fix it for

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:54,440
you if there are long URLs that you go

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,780
to lock and a whole folder in my text

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,610
expander that's just URLs but they spend

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,210
that all the time and it has this little

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,210
shortcuts

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:10,260
haven't typed out my address my address

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:13,110
and many years things like that so

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,820
little little things that add up so the

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,130
moment using actually called text

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,210
expander but I recently found this one

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:30,750
called a text and it's a lot cheaper

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:32,760
versus a okay

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:37,050
so things that you can do with

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,060
automation on morning love-love-love

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,100
automation for onboarding what does that

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,230
look like

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,560
back when I was more focused on websites

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,950
making websites for people I had website

00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,580
projects in inquiry and so you come to

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,990
my website and you would fill out a form

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,160
tell me all about your project and what

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,100
you're trying to achieve and all that

00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,980
jazz and we hit submit a couple things

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,600
would happen one all the information

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,850
that you just shared with me would go

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,350
straight to active campaign so that then

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,510
they have that record so then if you

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,680
have a team that needs to follow up with

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,020
that person they have all that

00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,820
information to the other thing that

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,970
would happen is that person would get

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,980
tagged about set off or applied to them

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,380
and hey thanks for filling out this

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,680
project in free form here's what's going

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,810
to happen next so what does that do it

00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,700
makes people feel like oh okay because

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,340
it was kind of a vapor form it took some

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,030
time so it tells them like hey we got

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,310
your thing

00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,070
we appreciate your thing and we know

00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,500
you're like what would now okay did you

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,720
tell them what's going to happen next

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:46,050
and I would also attach like a little

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,220
comes a range of investment for the

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,560
other number one question that people

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,150
out so then it doesn't matter what I was

00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,530
doing if I'm walking the puppy if I'm

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,720
dealing with another client if I'm

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,270
asleep I know that people are going to

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,950
get that response immediately so I love

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,310
it for onboarding you can also use it

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,850
for onboarding employees contractors

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:09,100
clients that's are repetitive tasks like

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,470
to talk about so imagine if you had to

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,320
have an employee like manually do that

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:17,650
pay another inquiry came in

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,620
go on send out the you know verify well

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,820
it slows things down and that person

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,060
couldn't spend their time doing other

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,220
things and then leave all night which I

00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:30,700
talked a little bit about and that's

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,530
just you know now I have an application

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,750
form if someone wants to work together

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,180
it's a big greeting you know go in

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,360
schedule get on the calendar and then go

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,580
on the application and they

00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,260
automatically go through that process I

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,560
don't have to go when they send them the

00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,300
next step so automation is awesome and

00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:55,720
you should totally go to just let's talk

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:59,260
about all right so just a recap the

00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,360
first thing is to understand and adopt

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,860
the system's mindset everything that you

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,380
do and your business

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,220
is a system you get up you get dressed

00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,350
you brush your teeth

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,940
like that's all systems and there are

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,120
systems happening in your business and

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,700
if you stop and think about them and

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,679
expose them that's when you can start to

00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,010
document them and then make those

00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,799
partition track your time because what

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:28,130
gets measured gets managed so you have

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,260
just know where your baseline is and you

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,679
want to focus on the right things a lot

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,850
of times were really busy and we're like

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,049
I don't have time to do all the things

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,059
and like 50 60 70 % of the things you're

00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:42,470
doing aren't really the things that are

00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,330
super important to when your business

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,140
forward so what you spend your time on

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,710
is just as important keep your goal in

00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,780
mind

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,240
keep your why mine why you're doing this

00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:56,840
you sure you're constantly like going

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,510
towards your North Star and then if it's

00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,340
important schedule it has to go on your

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:07,910
calendar or it's not going to go get

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:10,460
done all right so now is your turn I'm

00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,110
curious what are the things that have

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,520
shared here today what are you going to

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,520
implement and one are you

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,339
[Applause]

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,720
[Music]

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:51,560
yes for hours once you say the word on

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,810
your files - awesome awesome cool if you

00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,320
like the tools section you can go to

00:33:53,810 --> 00:34:00,380
Carmel digital comm slash tools and you

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,970
can get the the mini course that I have

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,320
it talks a little bit more in depth

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,360
about all the tools that I shared with

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:12,860
you today this is the puppy as of

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,700
yesterday these are our kitties these

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,699
are my wife

00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,849
thanks for coming

00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,849
[Music]

00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,219
[Applause]

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,070
sure yes so the question was about you

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,120
know focusing on revenue generating

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:50,950
activities until you can outsource so

00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,570
outsourcing you know there's things when

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,310
you when you start in your business like

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,010
you have to do everything like we're

00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,660
doing all the things but as you grow in

00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,430
your business there's gonna be things

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,530
that only you can do and there's going

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,210
to be a ton of other things that maybe

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,280
you're not good at or they take you a

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,590
long time that other people can do and

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,240
so starting to categorize those tasks

00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,740
and when you're tracking like what

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,870
you're spending your time on start

00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,000
thinking about well do I have to be the

00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:18,910
person who's scheduled to the social

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,190
media post you might have to be the

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,440
person who writes the blog post and

00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,270
someone else could go through that and

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,890
pick out the snippets and create the

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,430
social media posts someone else give

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:34,750
back if you saw tweets like in the last

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:41,290
24 to 48 hours about working that was

00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:43,240
brandy so outsourcing is a huge tool

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,070
that you can use to really supercharger

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,370
business because it gives you back your

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,500
time to spend on that that 80 percent if

00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:53,710
you meet clockwork he talks about the

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,020
QPR between a role and then you have an

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,300
exercise to help you determine like what

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,090
is actually the number one thing without

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,160
which like your business would just die

00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,520
right and that is the thing that you

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,780
have to protect it when most people

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,670
figure that out and when they figure out

00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,160
what they're spending our time on like

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:15,430
80% of your time should be spent on -

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,750
both between b-roll and most people are

00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:21,580
spending maybe like 20% and so doing

00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,170
that exercise of understanding

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,490
the thing that has to be protected at

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,490
all cost and everything else

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,860
why would like beaver builder okay so I

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:51,250
started as a developer I went to school

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:54,220
and got a degree in interactive web

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,440
design and development and so I started

00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,620
out just making websites for a long time

00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,240
and as I got more so what happened is I

00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,130
was make websites I would hand them off

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,830
to people they wouldn't do anything with

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,930
them because they were hard at work or

00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,990
what happened they wouldn't keep them

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:13,840
updated think attacked and so I got more

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,670
interested in working and marketing is

00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,260
about communication and in order to be

00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,670
able to communicate with your website

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,980
you have to be able to change things

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:26,050
easily so one of my primary missions is

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,480
to make it easier for the business owner

00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:31,600
to actually update their website

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,040
themselves if they want to and a lot of

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,230
people aren't technical and don't have a

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,090
technical background so beaver builder

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,130
is a theme builder and a theme that

00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,110
gives you that drag-and-drop page

00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,240
building a lot of people that reason

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,710
that they use Wix and Squarespace and go

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,000
 paid alerts who they want

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,790
drag-and-drop they don't want to have to

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,400
cook and they don't understand that

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:53,470
WordPress has tools now where it makes

00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,300
it very easy to get the layout and the

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,820
design that you want without having to

00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,900
become a developer and so that's why I

00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:06,160
love people

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:08,410
because yeah it depends which level if

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,849
you get but it I think it's like it's

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,559
somewhere between like 99 for for the

00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,569
plug-in and made a little mark for the

00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,210
theme but if you think about it you're

00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:23,289
actually getting a dedicated team of

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:25,480
developers who work full-time on making

00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,890
this tool awesome like if you heard of

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:46,630
paid for that if you were to actually

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:48,220
pay for their time yeah so there's

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,680
actually even milder light so you can

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,930
try it without having to buy it and I

00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,140
actually do have a post about these and

00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,730
my position on themes is that you should

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,609
be more concerned with the framework

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,740
that you're using then like trying to

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,980
buy such pretty picture and then shove

00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,089
your business in your content into it

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,799
you're gonna want to change and

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:10,640
literally be done by web say every year

00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:14,769
for the whole

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,599
so beaver builder makes that easy

00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:20,089
there's a couple alders that I like that

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,829
I try to strive the humans and the

00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:27,920
element are probably great that haven't

00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:30,140
used up because I guess I just wanted to

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,049
share little of people don't realize

00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,509
that if you have Adobe Creative Suite

00:39:32,049 --> 00:40:13,759
you actually have Adobe sign-in that

00:39:35,509 --> 00:40:16,730
sweet oh yeah already they have yeah if

00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:19,220
you're using an email client that's

00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,660
something else you might want to think

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,239
of something that integrates with your

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,420
client yeah I mean you can use Gmail

00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:31,759
with other clients you can use it with

00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:34,339
air mail for me like the the G suite

00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:36,650
basically which includes the your email

00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:39,410
and your calendar and you can get a

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:48,609
brand an email address so I just kind of

00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:48,609
have bought into that minutes

00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,220
what's the most important thing in four

00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,829
hours

00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:17,349
a little bionis it's really gonna depend

00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:20,140
on so I would say do the time tracking

00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:22,150
thing before you do your four hours so

00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,490
because you have to see like where is

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,520
your time going right and then it's like

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,650
I spend a lot of time doing you know

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,119
vlogging in social media and I'm

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:35,200
constantly looking for all these

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,760
vintages okay we're going a new path so

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,570
it really depends but do the time

00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,570
technique thing first

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:55,619
all right I will be around tomorrow yes

00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,619
think of questions and you want to chat

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,030
