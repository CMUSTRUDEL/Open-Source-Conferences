Title: Matt Kopala: Stop Guessing: Diagnosing & Fixing WordPress Performance Problems
Publication date: 2020-04-14
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Speed matters. People are impatient. If your website or a client’s website doesn’t load quickly – within a just a couple of seconds – many visitors will abandon it completely. A slow site means lost time & revenue. But figuring out how to speed up a slow site can be HARD. Everyone’s got a suggestion and an idea for how to fix your performance issues, but most are just guesses, and not based on real data. STOP GUESSING. If you have a performance issue, or just want a faster site, you need to KNOW exactly what is slowing things down, and how to fix it. This talk will show you how.

he is guessing diagnosing and fixing

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,759
food affects performance problems that

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,799
is the founder of st. District a

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,940
powerful and flexible WordPress hosting

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,769
platform

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,560
he has degree in computer engineering

00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,170
and started office professional career

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,650
as a member of the design team for

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,599
Andy's first 64-bit processor that is

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,700
passionate about understanding and

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,710
helping people soft is not just possible

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,560
on water providing the department's

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,750
security and foundation so you can focus

00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,410
on your business while your host takes

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,410
care of the rest

00:00:42,920 --> 00:01:22,520
around the world all right all right so

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,520
first about me probably mostly repeat

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,860
[Music]

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:44,340
here's Austin Texas remember couple

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:45,930
years after that I left and I took a

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,730
backpacking trip I went around the world

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,780
wispy for a year and a half and ended up

00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,970
eating three and a half years I got

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,560
involved with WordPress in 2011 when I

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,120
started doing some plug-in development

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,980
and back-end server services development

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:07,680
for a client and the project ended up

00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:09,929
being successful in my website on

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,300
WordPress lunch appliance and they're

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,480
having a server performance and security

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,090
issues so I ended up starting one has

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:24,300
become a center and we're now hosting

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:27,050
hundreds of clients all right now

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,050
today's

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,310
we talked about first light performance

00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:38,989
matters and how to actually measure it

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,110
talks about boost even more effective

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:45,890
has women will talk about their suitable

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:49,970
server response time talk about the full

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,310
a float and swim visa page just a few

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,720
words on caching and then because I'm

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,470
crazy and we have a little bit of time

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:06,290
doing break down again so first why is

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:07,629
performance matter so I'm not use these

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,040
guys but I think they have the best

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,079
working message at least that kind of

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,450
sums it up so how long does it take to

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,620
lose a customer two point seven seconds

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,420
they say that's the amount of time

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,639
before someone visit your website will

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,599
stop and then start over your

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,519
competitors so that's one way and just

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,250
summing it up conversions and paint

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,709
abandonment so if you've got paying

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:35,060
customers business it wakes your time

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,530
when you're developing and working on

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,129
your site especially at the back end and

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,209
the WordPress admin they're slow

00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,889
perception on their visitors your

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,260
customers when they come to your site

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,549
they have to wade through the page to

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,430
load up there too long and then that's

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,989
going to be the negative impression of

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,340
your Google ranking if your site is

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,209
extra slow that has some effect on that

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,459
besides the people at Google know

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,750
exactly how much that is but it's been

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,519
published and said that's your client

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,049
satisfaction if you're an agency or your

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,729
building lots of WordPress sites for

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,299
different people then they're more

00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:12,400
likely to come back for a new site or

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:17,019
redesign or

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,509
you go fast website and then I'd like to

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,100
make the bold claim that speed equals

00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,430
happiness and that's one of the biggest

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:29,160
reasons so so I'm going to drive that

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,160
point home think about this for a second

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,949
all right so let's do a quick survey

00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,299
area by show resume of how many of you

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,209
who have worked on your development

00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:41,649
cycle slow or became slow alright

00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,329
everyone look around say anything you

00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,339
want to read in their hands come up we

00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,439
got it we got some more questions how

00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,819
many time have you spent time trying to

00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:55,899
steal it looks like have given up on

00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,399
trying to scan the same apps which

00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:01,239
hosting providers because there's like

00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,979
this low and then you switched off

00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:06,669
plugins one at the time trying to speed

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:13,469
up the site while the ads on all these

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:17,019
how many have a slow site now alright so

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:19,149
a hypothesis and that is why top

00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:22,079
developers and designers and site owners

00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:24,729
speed up for its first low sites

00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,539
slowest over folder optimization is

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,999
often risky and uncertain you don't know

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,739
how much you don't know how to make the

00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:36,759
site faster and you don't know it for

00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:38,259
how much faster they can be and this so

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,269
there's nothing you don't want your site

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,219
to be bastards that you just not making

00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:45,159
a priority so I want to speak a little

00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:47,559
bit about priority and I'm going to

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:50,409
define priority he has value divided

00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:54,179
like that and I started off by talking

00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:57,099
about the value of performance and speed

00:05:54,179 --> 00:06:01,179
that so wrote about effort that effort

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,739
goes down then the priority goes up so

00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:06,759
my goal today is to show you how to

00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:08,769
minimize that number so first before we

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,279
try to fix performance we need to figure

00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:15,759
out how to measure it and understand it

00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,859
so some basics about Hasty Pudding so

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,019
I've created this diagram here it's kind

00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:22,360
of a simplified waterfall view what half

00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,829
your browser loads the page in the

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,419
browser loads the page up and displays

00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,889
it to you the first thing is I'll put

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,179
your domain in the address bar type it

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,489
up and then you'd rather needs to do a

00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,749
DNS query

00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:34,789
look how to find out where that site

00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:37,339
lips and then adult make connection to

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:39,529
the server and that MLS of a secure

00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,159
connection of your sites run an HTTP and

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,629
these days all your cycles should be it

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,579
will then send that request and wait for

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,860
the server to respond back and send back

00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:53,119
the initial age content it's just one

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,619
text files HTML in once the browser

00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,639
receives up that it could start doing

00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,649
other things in parallel

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,599
you start parsing that HTML to find out

00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:03,799
what else it needs to load such as

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,509
JavaScript CSS files fonts images you'll

00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,939
start making requests for those and then

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,559
it'll actually do the hard work of

00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,539
rendering and painting everything on the

00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:14,839
screen so you see the web page shown on

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,969
your browser so this first part here

00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,899
actually just that part right there is

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:22,909
often called the time to first light and

00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,920
that is from WordPress that's WordPress

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:28,990
running PHP and

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,990
at the end the Ford sent something back

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,060
how it's fast to that time the first

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:41,150
lady for work obviously the faster the

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:44,090
better and they talk about bashing the

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,980
epic let's we want to start by not

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,900
covering up any performance issues so we

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,510
want to see how fat that time first lady

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,360
is without a huge passion turned on so I

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:59,690
consider very fast to be 50 to 150

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:04,100
milliseconds fast 150 to 300 good under

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:07,370
half a second average slow very slow in

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,710
some sites that I've seen have taken 15

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,200
to 30 seconds actually 45 seconds to

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,460
return back that page back to the

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,670
browser so if you're sitting there

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,670
staring at a blank screen for 30 15 30

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:23,120
20 miles

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,740
so for WordPress I think under half a

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,690
second is a pretty good goal is for

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,700
uncashed speed so now how do we test

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,670
that and see what your ton of your time

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,830
the birthday is so one of my favorite

00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,810
tools is this thing from extension and

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,360
it's called paid performance and there's

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,729
a link to it there too and what this

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,770
does it just sits in your chrome toolbar

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,620
there and every time you load a page no

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,090
matter where what it is it's got this

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,070
little icon available here at the top

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,870
you can click on in the drop

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,670
the time you first played was for that

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,740
patient another way is you can actually

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,350
use Chrome itself and open up the

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,660
developer tools and you jump down a

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,880
little three little dots on top there

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,180
around here rules and then you want to

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,300
select the network tab and you will need

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,009
to reload the page if you do this the

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,480
network tab doesn't populate or less the

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,910
developer tools are amended so you can

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,290
have a page open this up remote and then

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,639
you can click kind of hover on the

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,810
little bar here and I'll tell you down

00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:29,839
here with your time the first place and

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,279
then one of my favorite tools is and

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,750
this is something to share with other

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,149
people too after you run the test as

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,279
webpagetest and so that's a web page

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,860
test test out together it'll see a

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,810
screen like this i recommend actually

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,089
logging in what they're doing are some

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,769
things that don't seem to need to do the

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,459
like CAPTCHA thing and identify

00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:53,000
streetlights and if you when you do this

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,880
though first probably want to set some

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,920
settings here so we're going to try and

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,110
test the best case speed for your

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,730
website so first of all pick the test

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:07,420
location that is near your server or

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,769
reverend your server is actually located

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,899
then something connections speak to

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:13,690
native which means it's not going to try

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,360
to slow it but loading down

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,339
pretending you're on a slower network

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,819
set the number of tests the one but then

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,620
click the repeat view and the first time

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:26,959
repeat view and what that will do is

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,459
give you it will run the test place but

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,300
once showing the effects of browser

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,560
national

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,880
we're visit you're cycling then they

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,510
continue browsing it or if they come

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,060
back later

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,520
usually that cycle will be faster and

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,230
then click the capture video button and

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,850
this allows to see if built strip you

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,550
will actually be able to see what people

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:48,710
are seeing and we're in with a timeline

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:50,480
as you excite this movie so once you run

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,510
the test you'll get a page back that

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,090
looks like this and we're definitely

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,880
trying to optimize these time to first

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,320
byte and speed index and that's

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,180
something you'll just find on the web

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,740
page test so we're going to ignore the

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,210
load time and I'm gonna tell you why in

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,130
a second so the speed index data five

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,080
nine is a time at which the visible

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,380
parts of the page are displayed

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,150
they will play an average of that so

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,790
when page test has a filmstrip view and

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,320
they'll show you over time with a little

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,910
label here as far as how much time has

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,940
passed how much of the page is showing

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,040
up at that time and so the lower the

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,950
better on this and this is act why is

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,570
this matter because this is what people

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:37,250
are actually seeing on your site there's

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,710
also a waterfall video I won't go into

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,850
this but it's a diagram that somewhere

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,130
at the one I showed earlier in the

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,750
presentation but it's specific to the

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,030
page you actually just tested and has a

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,420
lot more details for actual requests

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,280
going on this is the filmstrip view I

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,910
talked about we can seen out here in

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,170
this test here on the work camp website

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,680
that the user was looking at a brand

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:04,280
link screen for 0.7 seconds or so not

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,440
very long at all and 0.8 seconds started

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,260
to fill in the image kind of showed up

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,560
you know just a bit after and then the

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,560
menu

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:18,620
but right here at less than a second we

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,180
can see that most of the web page is

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,290
already there so that's what people are

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,420
seeing that's what they're waiting for

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,800
we can start interacting with it if

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,860
we're going to see things before they

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,579
even touch it anyway so what just get

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,529
enough up there so they can see it and

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:37,190
even though the low timeless a little

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:40,579
bit longer that the actual time that the

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,380
page render visible was less so others

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,680
contesting tools how many people know

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,880
we're having GT metrics all right or or

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,930
Pingdom all right so I don't recommend

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,120
the GT metrics and so the reason for

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,640
that is they list a bunch of things on

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,820
the site that to me will lead you down a

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,570
rat hole that you should be focusing on

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,279
they also require you to log in to see a

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,980
lot of this other stuff that's actually

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:15,770
interesting so I find that makes us much

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,970
more useful checking that out and just

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,410
sum it up

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,120
you're on remember is whatever it's

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,980
really are using is it showing you what

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,470
you're actually using are actually or

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,670
what users are actually experiencing so

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,440
we don't care about the numbers we don't

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,630
care about both points that we don't

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
care about some page scored like greater

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,020
speed we care about what people to your

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,940
site are actually seen all right so

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,450
let's talk about what makes up that time

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,420
to first byte aluminum one and so there

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:48,430
are some two main factors in that server

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:51,560
response time for

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,610
first is your hosting provider will talk

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,940
more than I'll talk more about that

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,570
later

00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:00,320
and next is their website implementation

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:04,580
WordPress that means your theme and your

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,830
plugins all right so I've got an

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,900
interactive part here and so I

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,270
pronounced it something you've got some

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,080
computer opener and I've got your your

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,970
mobile device go to this page right here

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,370
and you should see something like this

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,470
and hopefully if this is connected right

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,990
at the start but if you can put in your

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,850
own domain in here you can put in some

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,790
client-side to develop it into friends

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,010
site WordPress sites and if you fill

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,510
this in that should start populating up

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,280
here in real time for on both your

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,710
experience and the speed screen up here

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,440
so what this does we've built the tool

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,570
that will go off and it'll test the time

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,740
to first byte for your site and it will

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,720
show up in here if you're embarrassed

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,970
really slow site don't put it in here

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,010
because everyone's going to see it but

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,460
so we can see it starting up they left

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,050
out a little bit and remember I said the

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,510
time ideal your time the first night

00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,450
should be under a half a second well

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,310
that's great over here most of the sites

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:11,500
we see is in a bar or showing up over

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:11,500
here we can probably right

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,480
you guys can keep running that like

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,070
testing more sites on that right here I

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,840
try to look up the hosting providers and

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:34,350
classify them here in terms of the

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:37,620
average speed from slowest to fastest so

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:42,060
next I want to talk about jump back and

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,400
talk about WordPress hosting so does

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:49,200
your hosting provider yes it doesn't

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,780
matter matters a lot so is better

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,610
hosting the Silver Bullet for your speed

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,090
until this time actually it is yes

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,340
other times well this slow site with a

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:02,040
lot of plugins a lot going on there and

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,140
it may be faster on better hosting I am

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,730
too fast

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,370
how do you determine if your hosting is

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,960
a problem so will certain posting

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,520
providers are going to be well optimized

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,130
consistently fast and I have a

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,830
performance issues another provider so

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:20,880
depends on the plan box of dead server

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,560
configuration then stuff like that so

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,780
other some most equai that are just

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,060
known to be consistently slower too soon

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,950
another indicator is what web servers

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,580
are those frames is slightly more likely

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,860
both when I try to keep it simplified so

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,560
most custom managed murdered uh Spock

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,930
bones are running an engine X and kind

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,150
of custom stack and it's a little bit

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,490
Rathmines the number of those the number

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,740
of those hosts are small where commented

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,750
you'll find a lot of posts that are

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,780
running cpanel and apache together and

00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:01,410
anyone can spend hours

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,120
using the takeaway from this is that if

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,770
your hosting provider has cPanel

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,290
available actually an indication you're

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:12,780
slingin probably be faster so you could

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,730
also go through a checklist and check

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,410
anchors or a server having a whole bunch

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,640
of stuff on it I'm not going to go

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,980
through these and that's kind of the

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,150
point so that's a big long list then

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,190
plugins aren't going to help you with

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,990
these and so if you're a server

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,250
administrator yourself up so that you

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,280
may need to take some notes break those

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,940
down otherwise you might be thinking

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,480
that so what's a better way they didn't

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,740
like and talked about the page loading

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,560
we don't necessarily care about it

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,220
technically they're important and if

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,790
you're building the most important we

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,920
want to measure we know what your site

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,840
how your own site is actually performing

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,030
so cutting out their hosts is calming

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,440
part are all in this B problem or how do

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,170
you know if they're inclusive properly

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,580
optimize your server

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:06,030
well it's not easy to verify reliably

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:08,820
even that way well at least not while

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,110
it's on your current post so sorry

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,560
another hosting provider

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:17,010
now put the exact copy of your sight

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,140
line another optimized repressors so

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,910
there are several options for this I'm

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,770
gonna raynathan Mike how easy their

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,750
average or harder it seems a backup or

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,940
restore plugin and install plugin on

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,860
your current site and animals to

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,430
provider download the backup your stored

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:38,010
on on the new location you can use a

00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,170
migration or plugin that's kind of more

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,670
integrated letter supervisor where they

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,490
can do something a little bit more fully

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,840
automated and I'll jump through those so

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,450
the backup here some backup to restore

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,440
plugins some awful popular options that

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,660
can be used and grab these from your

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,250
slides later some hosting provider

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,380
plugins that they built for a migration

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,990
here's a couple more that are provided

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,730
by a service called blog both and for

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,890
migrating into your Pantheon and

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,160
contingent they have a plugin that were

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,990
to use that service and then we actually

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,330
have an import that's I think faster

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,800
than support in all these there's more

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:25,380
information on there another Schiller

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:28,110
slider so now let's say a fetcher slate

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,820
copied over reviewed new host how you

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,470
tested and check the seasons faster

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,200
welcome back and Rizzo

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,179
before it webpagetest and then we have

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,679
some tools later enough five times it's

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,840
pretty sure I'll show you some of the

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,450
tools that we have let you you saw

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,549
already the tool that we'll just test

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,020
one test a bunch of sites and throw them

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,330
all up on a screen that some others will

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:53,039
let you crawl through your site and see

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:55,770
how much for me so let's talk about cost

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,970
of hosting a friend of mine came up with

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,460
the best term and I thought it was a

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,909
great term I didn't find it on the

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:06,809
internet so I am one corner of it so you

00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:08,340
heard it here first and you all heard

00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,940
rigid speak this morning right I won't

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,520
hear it it all right so earlier this

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,539
year we did is I put up on Twitter and

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,400
she decides she's going to write a blog

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:24,179
post about host even her $25 that's a

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,700
regular for managed hosting and when I

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,559
read this blog post and she had $25

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,780
that's what my man is there's some cost

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,080
repressible and some people think it's

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,700
expensive so she journeys in this

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,169
creative business isn't worth it and so

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,270
she got some amount of money worth I've

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,520
given bucks to this and she posted some

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:47,010
smart stuff on her blog there's a link

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:51,900
to it to someone ever relies $25 one

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:54,630
button donuts Amy I believe speaking

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,460
this afternoon Starbucks and then I

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:01,760
think one of the best advice at least

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,760
the one I like Fester's is this one here

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:10,710
and Bridgette I don't find a lot so your

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,049
time is money so if you your host is not

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,570
that fast or you've got very issues to

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,600
deal with

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,480
they're wasting

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:23,590
you know that's the kind of something

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,630
out the American is for hosting pretty

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:30,190
much with the people replied to you from

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:33,850
her blog if it's greater business

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,110
supporting you get a lot of things with

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,850
more manage they've seen that other

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,070
places will upsell where they won't be

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:42,520
blonde over got this upgrade and again

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,200
and finally use your time we have

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,210
actually we're doctors from my

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,220
experience from importing and migrating

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,910
and testing whole bunch of those sites

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,770
of lost acres of time went through just

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,630
to provide this year bike from this

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,960
adjustable performance from what I've

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,210
seen and so I put up this slide last

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,720
week at Riverside and then afterwards I

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:11,680
got a weight but my specs pretty fast on

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,020
the slow call I think my sex fast but

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,360
that's a good question so trying to come

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:22,590
up with some replies to that and thanks

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,590
to consider our go

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,270
yeah ignorance is bliss that your site

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,620
might be loaded in two seconds like you

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:36,700
just haven't seen them loaded in one

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:38,169
second page caching are these your site

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,150
loading quickly because of K page

00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:42,610
fashion what it's a clogged in or what

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,210
if you're on their WordPress Batman in

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,240
the backend is it still this fast and

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,960
then yes maybe absurd enough if you and

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,740
your customers are happy then great as

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,720
fast enough and that mobile always

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,400
consider mobile something that loads

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,950
fast on your desktop might be a little

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,020
bit slow or on phone over up a little

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,120
network so that's it you can use

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,919
web-based test to set the connection

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,929
speed a little bit lower to see how

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,510
honorable it takes up for that page

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:17,110
below if you're on a 42 3G network

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,720
something like that when you might be

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:25,360
thinking wow I spent twenty slides

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:28,500
talking about thirsty so yes it is and

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,049
so just this last week I'll just

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:35,049
underline parts here I posted on our

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:37,710
Piper a question on popular Facebook

00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:40,390
group of 11,000 members line and this is

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,700
had a little bit of a dialogue with one

00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,410
of the guys on there so you try the

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,280
other suggestions and the results were

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,910
not worth it

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,830
I spent five days that's right but I

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,720
have any said the results are not worth

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,150
a look nominally that the web versus the

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,030
key I spent five days training in my

00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:01,070
networks did not work thanks

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,810
he was able to speed up it's like

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,490
another company just by switching hopes

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,490
after spending one time

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,610
all right enough thought no steam let's

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:14,780
talk about that server response time and

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,700
let's say you've already moved to an

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,710
optimized coast and your turn the first

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,600
place is because that's controlled

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,880
mostly by your server and routine let's

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,490
say that's still slow blessed to most

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,150
people that's a black box and that's

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,770
WordPress and PHP running PHP nice or

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,740
burning and you can look inside of it

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:36,220
well today let's take a look inside so

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm gonna show you some tools to do that

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,000
but first if you're diagnosing your site

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,430
and trying to optimize it then you're

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,320
going to go through several steps first

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,420
we're going to generate or wait for some

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,540
traffic to the site running loaded up or

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,000
live in production just lets people hit

00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,010
it and then you're going to review

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,330
you're going to need that profiling

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,740
enabled and then you're going to review

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:02,150
those results and we're going to use a

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:05,240
new relic for that too and then you'll

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,310
make a change in your repeat and the

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,530
difference between the doing this and

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:13,310
what most people are doing is instead of

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:15,140
guessing for this step here we're going

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,030
to make step three based on what we

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,060
learn in step two we're gonna have

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,500
needle good data that's going to tell us

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,559
what exactly is going on

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,750
that's why I'm very slow let's check out

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,490
the irrelevant so New Relic is an

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,890
application performance Margaritaville

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,370
and there's a free version available the

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,470
pro versions and most useful you do need

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,929
with level access to install it on your

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:42,020
server but it also has provided by a

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:43,880
server WordPress hosting providers and I

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,919
have personally diagnosed hundreds of

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:51,260
performance issues across lots of sites

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:54,490
and very little time thanks to you to be

00:25:51,260 --> 00:26:02,929
relevant and so once we jump in here

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:04,789
we're going to see an overview tab I try

00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:09,230
to turn that off obviously wasn't

00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:11,090
successful and it's interesting we'll

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,770
see how long the server without the

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,450
server response time is I'm just going

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:17,090
to spend in PHP in my sequel but that's

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,570
not really all that helpful it's nice to

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,190
know but what is really valuable is what

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,380
you're like added a couple years ago I

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,730
mean they add a feature which is

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,710
WordPress specific and will actually

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,870
break down to the press and show you

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,880
what's going on so if you click on that

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,530
page under the plugins and themes that's

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,419
going to show us how much time is

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,309
actually gonna spend from each of the

00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,730
themes or each of the plugins order

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:42,860
theme so this example site that we

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,470
tested out we found out this a be

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,780
testing plug-in here was taking 50% of

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,400
the response time off and it turned out

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,169
for this particular site they didn't

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,120
actually need that plug-in they were

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,929
just able to turn that plug-in off of

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,929
the sake of choices

00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,820
here's another example if you need the

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,590
more information you can dig down in the

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,140
relic is something called transactions

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,330
views and that's for a single request

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,420
that you can dig down in and find out a

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,040
we're expending time so I think this

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,480
screenshot here because this is a

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,340
request that actually finished

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,160
relatively quickly but then there was a

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,380
hook that ran on the end and after the

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:27,500
January of the whole agent was about to

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,480
finish help it went off and ran the

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,820
scripted six of that into jet pack

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,860
enough took an extra two seconds so what

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,600
would have been a 250 millisecond

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,620
response turned into two and a half

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,080
seconds ten times as slow as it should

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,390
here's some examples even rather old and

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,960
just because I'm plugging shows up here

00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:51,050
is that one could be configuration

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,270
that's a starting point but for this

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,490
whatever module was enabled with jetpack

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:59,280
errors we return this turn off jetpack

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:03,210
who can see right away that performance

00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:05,790
they improved significantly

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,010
sometimes the WordPress happened pretty

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:11,970
slow again this is old and it might not

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,250
be applicable but in this case the SEO

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:19,470
weather was making all of the admin

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,970
pages a bit slower so before turning

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,080
Relic this is when I felt like trying to

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,160
figure out problems when I very first

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:35,400
started posting cycles trying to figure

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:38,460
out the issues so right away I said all

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,770
right some considerations though it does

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,710
impact performance pretty significant I

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:47,430
found so usually I'll turn it off when

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,900
it's not being used but you can't go

00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,140
back in time so if you have some kind of

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,940
issue that only happens intermittently

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,490
or indeed to wait for it to happen when

00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:00,450
people leave it on for a while until so

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,490
the request comes through it's not the

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,130
number of plugins on your site but it's

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,720
actually what they are doing so and a

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,970
plug-in so it doesn't necessarily mean

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,170
it's a bad one or like I said it it's a

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,790
starting point so check the

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,230
configuration settings check out the

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,970
plug-in developers released a new

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,910
version in there or something like that

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,890
and it may be fixed already or you might

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,630
just need to change

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,270
your theme can also be a major factor in

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,280
performance problem - so that's often

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:32,110
harder to fix so profile of your singer

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,290
there are some guides to just give up

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,640
this time people have slides up several

00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:41,260
good guides on how to diagnose

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,630
progressive problems with you go alright

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,400
people worried about plugins

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,370
optimization plugins well they can't

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,290
optimize your raw site performance but

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,400
they're generally doing is just covering

00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:57,400
up performance issues I generally don't

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,170
recommend Lee and you don't need them

00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,380
for the most case one better go stink

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,420
and they can actually make server

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,610
response times worse because they're

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,860
doing a bunch of stuff too

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,210
maybe they're doing things to try and

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,980
help your page load but then it's

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,970
actually affecting that server response

00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:23,160
time one possible exception is page

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:27,340
caching so actually other usually wrote

00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,770
anymore so on our own hosting until

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,200
earlier that earlier this year we did

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,060
some performance upgrades and we got and

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,040
our states begin let's see our server

00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,800
we're already a lot faster than in

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,720
several places but there was not quite

00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,660
as fast as some of the fastest providers

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,190
that I had had experience with so we did

00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,310
some optimization in person it's about

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:52,540
twice as fast and this was more than a

00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:54,550
20 30 % game than I expected and spikes

00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,440
it's there so fashion at least on our

00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,440
platform is often not necessary

00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:04,720
Laurel this larae is optimized so Steven

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,370
was even more important than I realized

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,309
and so psyched and I think there's even

00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:16,059
more all right let's talk about the page

00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:18,130
loads we talked about first a.m. and the

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:21,850
time to first blank and that bottleneck

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,380
of getting a page to the browsers and

00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,880
the vendor browser use the load and pull

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,059
everything else up so what affects the

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,710
rest of that so one thing is each key

00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,270
can be true this is a server level thing

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,860
to your so it used to be an animal on

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,480
your host what does a newer version

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,020
makes you to be than speeds on things

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,450
quite a bit

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,929
it does mean you do need to have HTTPS

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,850
and able to have this like it's been

00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:48,340
around for several years has some great

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:50,980
speed benefits which just went through

00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,990
but somewhere posts are still not

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:58,480
running so how do you check so just a

00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,220
few more things a lot of things that

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,610
optimum recommended to speed up sites

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,320
such as combining concatenating files

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,409
making train have multiple use multiple

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,330
domains to have type 1 or like parallel

00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:12,090
requests going on aren't as important

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,400
with HTTP ordering than necessary

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,260
because of the winterboers inlining

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:21,190
assets of a stuff like that so make sure

00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:23,080
your host has HTTP 2 and how can you

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,120
check your size of 82 there's another

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,460
Chrome extension that but at least

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,500
normal and it'll just light up in your

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,050
tool bar a different color based on

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,660
whether the

00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:37,790
connected to has HTTP to enable or not

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,440
resent in there and when it's enabled

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:43,790
another ways you can actually go into

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,280
the but you can right-click on the

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:54,170
inside the network tab and show this

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:58,910
actually all right now thoughts images

00:32:54,170 --> 00:33:02,690
asset from fresh energy so your hosting

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:05,660
provider should have decent enable at a

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,690
minimum that's a successful show us

00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,030
compress transfer and then broccoli is a

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,310
faster and higher compression tool

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,470
that's from Google and more advanced

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,290
there's off of that if you can also

00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,390
check in chrome developer tools whether

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,040
that's being enabled if you click inside

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,780
the network tab on one of the requests

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,790
you can look for a content including it

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,300
doesn't be honest with them it's using

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:32,360
probably image compression this is a big

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,430
one so on webpagetest also has a pie

00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,280
chart down at the bottom that shows how

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:39,080
much of your data worried about page

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,520
load is attributed to the images so

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,820
scroll down on the bottom take a look at

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,410
paddock the purple here is really large

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,850
and you do not get a good grade on

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,180
compressing images and you're probably

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:52,550
want to compress your images one cool

00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,710
plugin that I've seen that I like also

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:58,420
helps you with scaling down huge images

00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:01,310
so if you try to upload your 24 negative

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,510
thick slope like image up your website

00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,120
that will scale it down to something

00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,160
reasonable and that's insanity and they

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,770
can resize huge files on whether you can

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,250
adjust the image quality and you can

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,510
also you can convert PNG to JPEGs and

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,090
feel with the engine that doesn't have

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,980
transparency and

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,860
just for it looks like a photo it should

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,040
be a jpg and you can also fall resize

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,330
your images here's a screenshot with a

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:32,470
couple settings that you might want to

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:34,030
adjust all right so I'm going to skip

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,560
these there's some more advanced topics

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,180
if you really need you've gone through

00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,000
all these things you need more speed out

00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,830
of your site then you might leave alone

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,410
even images something the old server

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,480
push or happiness again some of those

00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:48,010
are more complicated at the CDN is often

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,110
quite easy and especially with a lot of

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,620
player let's save that stuff for last a

00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:56,830
few dozen optimized everything else and

00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:59,440
caching so there are different types of

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,640
caching and this is the exact I think

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,930
it's gonna get a topless everything

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,110
about passionate so check that one out

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,940
if you're interested than that page

00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,010
caching object test I'm not going to go

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,950
into details about this except page

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:15,070
caching is a there's a common one is it

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:18,580
the solution for a slow site and I say

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:21,160
no and caching was designed and it's

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:25,480
great for scaling websites with a lot of

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,110
traffic so I would argue that your site

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,300
should be fast without passion and then

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,580
catching up slightly and higher ups for

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,490
performance and often only part of the

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,340
time uses the lastest word up to do by

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,500
targeting us where this age fashion fall

00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,910
down well the WordPress admin it's not

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,940
going to help you there who work in the

00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,970
back ends at that slow if you're logged

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,080
and often times page hashing disabled so

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,990
the front end of your site when you're

00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,100
developing that could be slower

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,589
you've got a large site with a lot of

00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,420
ages that might not

00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:59,099
effectively you have a Content that's

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,469
customized to the user again you have

00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,109
issues Cassius can also expire them

00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:05,940
flush and that next requesting that

00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:07,229
doesn't hit that cache and you have an

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,219
optimize your site it's going to be

00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:13,349
quite slow for that because they're so

00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:15,769
submarine you want your site to be as

00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:18,180
fast as possible without the page - I

00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:21,390
found this really good article on a

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,950
quote from him - is to be possible to

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,539
turn off page caching on a regular day

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,479
with normal traffic and not didn't hear

00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:33,359
this about inside and even on a busy day

00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:35,249
it shouldn't crash the website for

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,009
WordPress I meant most managed hosting

00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:41,789
providers not actually can provide page

00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:43,650
caching it's not that you can't get your

00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,180
time to first byte under let's say jory

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:49,200
milliseconds or you just want just like

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,940
to be faster then look into it or try to

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,299
get out of that working there will often

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,910
be noticeably faster yeah your hosting

00:36:54,299 --> 00:37:00,210
provider is not he's a high-performing

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:02,880
or recycle is heavy technology or uses

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:05,369
certain things like WooCommerce and page

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,440
builders certain things tend to start

00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:10,369
put all those together and pin slowest

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,789
like a wordpress site down considerably

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:16,769
and yes a girl save it for last just

00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:18,450
evaluate might still wanted at the end

00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:23,789
but try and speed up your site as much

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:26,009
as campers all right so summary measure

00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:27,960
your performance first think again when

00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:29,489
a provider or switch to one think that

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,460
your return to first place still slow

00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:36,599
your profile and won't be relevant so

00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:38,130
sorry optimizing images use a plan for

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,319
page bashing impress us with the Bible

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,780
already and add us in the end

00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:46,210
around globally or your service far away

00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,450
from the audience where yourself and

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,980
then feel free to ask for help after a

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,010
fantastic result for us someone here

00:37:50,980 --> 00:38:00,400
that we're sorry all right

00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:03,599
and looks like have a little time and so

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,160
let me do just a quick quick demo of

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,800
some of the tools that we have including

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,270
for testing your site performance this

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,270
is our website if you come here

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,110
she's going to confirm this and then

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,570
once I planned it inside my account here

00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:45,590
I can click this add an existing slate

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:50,030
and so I can pick a site here and set up

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:53,660
a test site go ahead here daddy gave me

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:59,390
a pretty - it was a dollar box right

00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:10,850
here and so when you click this it goes

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:12,290
out and what's up this will come off

00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,530
that lets up some information about the

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,820
vents like where does it go to state

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,190
where's the MS being provided and stuff

00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,010
like that and then click Add site and

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,680
let go and work during site site

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,420
district and once that's done it takes a

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,160
little bit I'm going to actually spin

00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,590
through this next stuff here welcome dr.

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,110
and install the plug-in for migrating a

00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,360
couple site but just from having a site

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,790
in here with the domain name I've got a

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,190
few tools available to us to me over

00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:42,890
Deanna on the side I can run a web page

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,540
test directly from here and it will keep

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:48,170
the results inside safe this jerk so I

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,820
can take that out pop that into the new

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,500
tab will probably take pretty good to

00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:56,690
run I could do a speed test this is one

00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,730
this will go off and it will hit 30

00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:02,210
pages on well you can actually

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,980
number question on the site and figure

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:08,150
out why the server responds - throughout

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,440
the site so this would go off crawl

00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,060
through the site that will actually have

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,349
a much on this site but sending hitting

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,060
the dark ages on the slate

00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:23,500
looks like they're all coming in right

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:23,500
about the same and I'm finishing an idea

00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:43,130
go back over here actually import my

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:53,060
site I can just pop open this dialog and

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:55,190
install the plug-in so I can put in any

00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,990
WordPress administrator username and

00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,820
password and trying to go off and our

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:03,859
server will go off and try to install

00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:06,859
the plug-in on that we're gonna say yeah

00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:09,200
it worked and then I can just click

00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,520
through click import slate you know go

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,829
off a little verify it

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,190
we're trying to pull in a copy of this

00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:18,369
site so well that runs it's a it's

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,050
basically just a fresh WordPress install

00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:23,030
2017 theme nothing special so it should

00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,550
be pretty quick but we can jump over

00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:29,390
here and see the web page test results

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:31,069
from run out there so we can see we

00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,470
click in here in the filter view we can

00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:35,930
see what's kind of going on so on this

00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,490
test site here user was looking at a

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,530
blank screen until about one point two

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,420
seconds I'm starting to get this great

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,410
background fade in and then I one point

00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,920
four seconds but sites actually show

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:50,549
there see online that cycle ooh let's

00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,150
put a page test there come back over

00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:55,619
here

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:58,170
the still going see and then I'm going

00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,930
to repeat you this is with the page

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:03,930
cache and browser caching enabled should

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,519
be a bit faster and we'll see here blank

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,710
screen blank screen and that boom

00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,839
everything appears at one second so a

00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,630
little bit faster like I said very light

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,819
side just a 20-17 base install but

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:19,859
that's how web page test works and what

00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:29,180
you can see inside of there this is

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:39,089
still sending up three minutes all right

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:41,099
we'll finish up if you've got your

00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,829
questions get your questions ready oh

00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,509
let's see if I don't if done have time

00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:47,400
for questions after this or I'll just

00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:49,289
let that run I mean I'll just take a

00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,420
couple right now so I want in the back

00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:54,769
right there you haven't said anything

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:59,849
about Google PageSpeed insights of the

00:42:54,769 --> 00:43:01,950
diagnostic rule mysterious what here so

00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,619
the question was about Google PageSpeed

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:09,299
insights and I think it gives you some

00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:11,970
great insights but again I would say

00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:14,220
still focus on what your users are

00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:17,069
actually seeing so back to like how long

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,769
does it take until that content is

00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:21,990
showing up to the user in front of their

00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:23,720
face and you can use web page test to

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,280
test mobile versions and different

00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,650
engine speed stuff like that so I

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,740
wouldn't personally focus more on that

00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,390
you could use it as a guide for helping

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,359
optimize that but that just keep their

00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,880
end goal line

00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:40,130
all right to go ahead and do right there

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:54,950
what do you suggest for like areas with

00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:56,960
slower internet so the question was yeah

00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,770
if you've got visitors that are having

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:04,550
very slow internet connection then yeah

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,619
that's a tough one there no 10 again

00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,660
just test it as well as you can pick

00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:11,240
they're located far away from your

00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,069
server in a CDN and place there but see

00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,290
how it's performing and then see what's

00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:17,510
slowing it down is that your is that

00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,790
your time to first byte or is it your

00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:22,910
images or some other things loading them

00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:25,130
and you can do as much as you can off

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,530
its kind of add emission diminishing

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,690
returns to optimize what you can and

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,119
then to really speed it up even more

00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,160
it gets harder as it goes but test it

00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,109
and then kind of try and see what's

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,560
going on in there and webpagetest like

00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:43,010
people so once we've imported to stay

00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,900
here we can clean this tool ill actually

00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:47,450
load up the two sites side by side and

00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,670
click this test again I'm kind of tested

00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,270
over and over anytime see how long it

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:56,180
actually the page load is for the main

00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:58,069
same the main so we've important to copy

00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,170
this is the exact same site nothing has

00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:01,910
changed we're bringing it over from

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,310
GoDaddy of the space number nasai

00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,470
Tichenor and you can see this the speed

00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:09,410
difference for living now we want to

00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:11,690
test throughout the pages that the speed

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,329
crawl that I showed you we can do a

00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:18,200
crawl on both sites simultaneously and

00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:20,210
this will go through the pages on 30

00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,850
pages on both copies of the site and

00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:25,770
show you

00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:28,680
yes they are so yes our dim part

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,570
includes the buttons that grabs up all

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,190
of both files are metal underneath their

00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:37,200
main folder and the databases in the

00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,270
river stores I think we X would like if

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,940
you're using backup system I'd actually

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:46,260
backup process a little old place for

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:51,000
that and so that's that artist in this

00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:52,970
case the site is five times faster

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,170
nothing changed just by switching

00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:01,020
hosting providers alright that's that

00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:14,670
for the quick demo I won't show a relic

00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:17,810
too much cuz we're out of time often

00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,810
time just yeah

00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,380
[Music]

00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,560
traffic can't make a difference if

00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:41,270
there's a lot of traffic to the site for

00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,230
sure it depends on the hosting and the

00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:47,270
set up I think the biggest reason this

00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:51,890
is a little speculative that's like our

00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:54,380
or on certain hosts is that the sort of

00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:57,200
the server is overloaded there's this I

00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,390
have on the server so now that load

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,119
effects those the speed quite a bit so

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:03,470
on out our environment for example we

00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,510
make sure we've balanced out what would

00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,010
give a lot of space there so that it

00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,080
keeps even if there's a spike in traffic

00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:19,940
they're gonna keep the speed speed

00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:23,480
constant it can but it's for most sites

00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:26,839
it's not really a factors but I have

00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,490
seen on on our platform of these sites

00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:29,060
can get a lot of traffic and the site

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,220
will slow down

00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,710
but I have to know my other places that

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,839
once they would you get quite a bit of

00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,230
traffic to the site the site will slow

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,230
down there

00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:51,489
[Music]

00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,870
yes yeah so well we charge for hosting

00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,060
so got to sign up in a you know for that

00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,160
if you were migrated to us but then yeah

00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:10,620
only after that it's pretty much updated

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,900
years other than any other questions all

00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,360
right I think one or two more right

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,429
there

00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,429
[Music]

00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:40,400
that's a good question

00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:42,680
Am I I think you might save time by not

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,369
worrying about optimizing then Photoshop

00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,410
unless that's a streamlined process for

00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:50,599
you.we let's see I don't have any

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,680
plugins really to recommend I listed the

00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,619
one up there and that's mostly because

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,479
well it'll do the work when it when you

00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:58,940
upload the images which is nice and will

00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:00,650
take care of 20 huge images we actually

00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,690
I didn't download actually built an

00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:05,720
image optimization tool into our hosting

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:12,319
and we did that because we can do it 20

00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:15,109
times faster so and then actually get

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,809
quite a quite a bit better optimization

00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:19,460
some of these others in the tool not

00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:21,789
sure exactly why we're not doing

00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,789
anything

00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:27,200
but we're using imagemagick actually to

00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:29,630
optimize images and I've seen it just

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,290
optimized elsewhere and we run our tool

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:36,410
on them

00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:39,170
on our server and order 15 or so so yeah

00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:42,110
I'm not sure the best thing to do for

00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:58,370
that is think about what your time this

00:49:42,110 --> 00:50:00,650
but 10 just make sure your images are so

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:03,140
I was using 8 p.m. which is application

00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,740
of the woman's monitoring and so it's a

00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:09,350
PHP extension is installed on the server

00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:18,760
it's very easy to install that you gave

00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:18,760
me access to yes

00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,890
so we're going Jim we have just our

00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,330
servers are located in one location

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,040
right now balance for Health Affairs

00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:58,400
some of the other hosting providers I

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:58,400
