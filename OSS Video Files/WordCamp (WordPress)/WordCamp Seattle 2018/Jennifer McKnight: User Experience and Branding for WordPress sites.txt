Title: Jennifer McKnight: User Experience and Branding for WordPress sites
Publication date: 2020-04-11
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	While WordPress makes it easy to build just about anything, the content you eventually place on that site will determine it’s effectiveness. This talk will explain the basics of UX website design as it relates to WordPress, with an emphasis on the impact of branded content. It will also suggest ways to easily incorporate UX design and branding into the sites you build.
In addition to these topics, I’ll also share some WordPress-compatible tools that help improve a site’s UX, overview the relationship between user experience and SEO, and provide a takeaway that designers can use to help create branded, UX-friendly content for their sites.

[Music]

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,600
Carolina girl

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,540
the tendency to be laid back in serious

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,420
studies while they sifted ordering our

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,760
favorite corporal we found under comic

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,860
and the right she now commences

00:00:23,760 --> 00:01:02,700
full-time with the new X writer while

00:00:25,860 --> 00:01:16,170
also running an online games January so

00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:23,639
who's ready for before we get started

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:26,819
talking about that investing so this

00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:31,579
breath when I actually much time

00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,579
thinking about well where did

00:01:31,750 --> 00:02:24,489
because where did you get that

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:34,130
what are you gonna make me one and pray

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:37,870
these last three hours oh she's kind of

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,870
laughter every time I ask her

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,290
orange had a crochet but the funny thing

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,350
about it was it didn't stop at the bank

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:56,420
back then it was a scarf with a hat it

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:59,560
was love I was like girl seriously can

00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,560
you like make a dress or something

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,130
so some reason with what I got to open

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,570
the seat I the first thing that popped

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,160
in my mind is somewhere in that dress

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,880
I'm not kidding that's the first thing

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,010
in my life and so I think the reason

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,620
that I immediately bought this dress is

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:25,790
because the dress is very kawaii the

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,190
story behind it my personality just the

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,000
things that I value it really defines me

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,000
and I felt like

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:31,880
[Music]

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:33,950
and experience experience I think I

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,970
should kind of explain why I'm qualified

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:40,130
to do so I've been working content

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,210
marketing for about nine years

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:47,960
prior to that I worked at a I work

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,450
experience working and that I was a

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,860
journalist all of these things rabbit

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:57,470
screaming freelancer but I've also have

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:05,780

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,260
thing I have been doing it since fully

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,370
yeah needless to say I was content

00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:29,400
especially with the background of

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:36,699
working working in to tell a story

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:41,559
design is great you can tell stories

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,220
have stories ahead with great place

00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,269
actually

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,269
[Music]

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:55,449
I was halfway Brothers website in 2000

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:58,270
it was a big industry site order my

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,580
daughter and when I remembered about my

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,779
Allah sent over this was lonely irony

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:08,219
only Specter that are coming from

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:08,219
scratch and back then it was it was just

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,920
[Music]

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,909
my web site

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,210
[Music]

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:45,429
[Music]

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,040
[Music]

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,279
[Applause]

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,700
[Applause]

00:07:51,490 --> 00:08:00,759
[Music]

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:27,850
his call to action this is getting

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,850
people to stop was you want to be I

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,310
swear if I didn't actually know this man

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,240
I think it was a great get up I would

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:41,570
literally do stuff okay so the thing

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,550
about he asked you to be a spokesperson

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,490
sort of business that was there working

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,560
as a person for a lace companies I was

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,520
also at that booth but I was a lot more

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:57,320
if you would set up anything yes

00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:00,200
oh but he kept bugging me and eventually

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,690
I helped him out with his harmony and I

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,980
have no sponsorship opportunities

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:10,190
promotion ideas public relations a lot

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,610
and eventually I ended up doing his

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,590
website as well so now I was a marketing

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,240
person I used to be an experience for

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:23,570
our members so what happened up to that

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:26,330
the Bible reason he is like many other

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,760
small businesses and that he doesn't

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:33,770
have time to focus on this marketing he

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,520
has to focus on why man and quality and

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,280
logistics

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,390
don't be stuff and he hardly needed my

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,690
help to help the marketing and you

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:46,030
a website you made this is hard to do

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,200
any type of designer from health or

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,540
small businesses

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,910
darica expect you to do their marketing

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,860
as well because they a multi-time I

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,830
don't have the time or the expertise to

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,390
really know how to present themselves to

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,420
customers they just know that they want

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,300
to and suddenly becomes your problem so

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,850
small businesses need to be conspiring

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,430
about bringing a user experience is not

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,200
just something for big websites for

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,990
every website needs to be concerned

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,350
about branding and he's both and he's

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,960
experienced excuse me the difference

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:26,620
between an example I like to think of

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,790
this say you had people you had set up

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,010
with you will need determine some

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,630
paperwork and if you have a people with

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,910
their and how to take over right there

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,160
they just come in and they staple it and

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,350
they put it you know get it done well

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,540
what if you have a beautiful

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,450
receptionist who took the papers from

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,590
house they lit and got it but one of

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,060
them's going to make more of an

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,980
impression on your customers than the

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,740
other even though they both do the exact

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,910
same thing that is a difference between

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,340
bringing a new experience and not happy

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,500
so that was kind of give a little bit of

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,840
overview as to why we should care about

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,810
great user experience I learned to give

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:09,780
very basic overview of what they are all

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,780
of my actual tips on how

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:22,530
so first of all a brand is more than a

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,650
thing right it's not a brand name a

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:30,270
toothbrush a brand name is something

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:32,430
like a pirate or said we need Britain's

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,460
a lot of our societies but branding

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,070
business the idea that something

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:57,180
happened personality it's when I try to

00:11:38,070 --> 00:12:00,900
service more than the actual president

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,350
actual perception how people perceive

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,240
your private service is a huge worship

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,150
initially they thought what is the plan

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,010
it is about you had an attribute is the

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:15,000
perception that you will have about your

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,680
product and can either earth or or help

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,019
you

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,089
make sure that perceptions of good one

00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,059
the thing the big thing to remember

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,339
though there is no infection time people

00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,350
are interacting with your repository

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,329
it's not like thing having any feelings

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,449
about it it's not a brand which is a

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:35,269
product service it's you want to be

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:39,649
memorable in some way and that is that's

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:42,920
what makes you a breath okay I'm Breanna

00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:45,860
can't be defined but it's simple and

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,910
part of the reason is because it's based

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,589
on perception is based on something

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,149
that's not really concrete so trying to

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,129
try and include your actual definitional

00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,499
it this is what the brand is the minute

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,899
you understand what that brand is it may

00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:05,420
shift into something else because this

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,939
is based on an amount of one person's

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,129
five on the private services but a whole

00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,990
groups of people just talk about it and

00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:14,929
then as more and more people have

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,800
oxidizers some people's viral it can to

00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,330
spiral out of control and and change so

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,850
defining a brand is

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,220
in art as reason why there's read

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,720
strategist and all these branding

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,330
specialists because it's really

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,920
complicated and I'm not trying to go on

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,290
to that I just want you guys to

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,660
understand that it is a very big topic

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,670
that you have a negative brand

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,970
experience happening right now you can

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:44,840
change it very quickly and the process

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,670
of doing so is branding branding is and

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,530
on products and services with the power

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,320
of the breath taking the product or

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,660
service and giving it a brand and admit

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,150
something that people associate with it

00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:02,840
of the natural product or service there

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,640
are few ways to do this with then you

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,440
can do it with advertising and over

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,690
private line you can do it with your

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,940
in-store experiences you know the price

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,520
name you know--with it's the identity of

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,430
the product but with determined web

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:22,000
designs you can impact advertising

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:22,000
product design and store experiences and

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,610
so some ways to incorporate branding

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,480
into web design easy way is by using

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,130
video elements that have people in them

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,020
even if you're selling something that is

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,820
extremely boring the minute you put a

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,760
testimonial on there with someone having

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,470
a compelling and compassionate story

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,020
people are gonna identify with that

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,650
products a bit more that's for anything

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,080
you can also try on characters that

00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,690
personifies inequalities do you know how

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,580
to sell sugar cereal you put Captain

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,830
Crunch on it that's how you sell sugars

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,480
do you know it's what the character and

00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,790
you didn't even take that character in

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:16,500
and our personality to it

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:17,880
and it doesn't matter what I think you

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,620
know the way I what I think know

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,300
something that we want the character day

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,320
they can be natural people that they

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,170
have that cold temperature brand goes

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,970
with it the last thing that has an

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,650
aesthetics that elicit emotions when

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,750
you're designing think about the

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,150
aesthetics think about how we were going

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,820
to kill by what you're seeing that goes

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,780
over to the psychology of branding and

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,700
stuff like that that's more specific

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,760
specific divine principles that come in

00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:51,390
to come into play with branding but it's

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,340
also and from our community content as

00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,170
we would

00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:01,850
[Music]

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:12,769
all of that okay so these are some

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:14,570
specific ways that you can know so bread

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,820
probably linked to human experiences and

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,890
emotions and website offer unique

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,690
opportunity to elicit emotions and

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,160
create experiences and these are the

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,839
ways that cific live within a website

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,899
that you can brand with advertising this

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,970
is how you to specifically have these

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,950
copywriting on your website your choice

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,320
of language and your whole advertising

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,110
strategy you slogan all of that some

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,970
other advertising your in-store

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,730
experiences are relevant to like

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,320
e-commerce stores how how they go

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,630
through the checkout process on your

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,510
website that's one effective branding

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:56,420
visual identity is a choice logos colors

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:59,959
thoughts yeah a new mobility in how easy

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,610
it is to navigate through a website it's

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,290
difficult to get through your website

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:08,600
that can cause a negative brand

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:10,819
experience that won't be so once again

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,100
to summarize branding websites are one

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,260
of the most effective ways to brand your

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,440
product or service

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,290
because you can do advertising and

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,390
effective or experienced

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,589
usability with it it has multiple ways

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,570
of impacting the brand

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,270
yes you can bring through other efforts

00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:30,160
of course and then if you talk to red

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,380
crab you still probably I'm waiting any

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,980
element to buy a new contract but

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,560
website nice easy way to do it or at

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,440
least get started so I'm going to move

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:46,570
on to user experience and user

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,400
experience when we're in France oh and

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,330
what's a team create experiences that

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,550
lead to branding experiences create the

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,000
individual perceptions that lead to

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,500
greater they're very much related but

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,410
they're very different at the same time

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,060
so let's go little bit deeper into your

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,480
experience appointed on norman of the

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:14,490
nose Norman group user experience is

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,140
everything it's not just when your

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,720
website either interacts with the

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,630
website it's everything that's going on

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,630
with that user before during and after

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,600
they interact with your website because

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,600
of this it's the best way to put it is

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,910
entirely rooted in existentially and

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
asked where I practice that were like

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,150
two months

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,309
and as babies it's just one of those

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:53,370
things that you just it's hard with my

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:55,320
existentialism and user experience user

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,210
experiences when are obligate

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,550
perceptions that are not always want to

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,620
fire more because they're incorporating

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,840
more than the obvious experience that

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,150
you know website or web developer might

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,460
see or what they think is going on so

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,610
it's you have to research and really

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,210
understand the experiences of meetings

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,360
or connect a process it's tied to

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,280
emotions and attitudes which also makes

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,890
a little bit more hard to measure

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,470
because you know just like a branding

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,420
the experiences that people have the

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,550
emotions that people have that they form

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,740
the perceptions they're all are going

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,920
can change on whether they also change

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:39,340
face

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:41,740
they live so it's really trying to

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,930
understand your user experiences in

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,090
challenging tasks because of that and

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,690
the last important thing I want to point

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:52,900
out about user experience is that it is

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,520
separate from usability they're not the

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,190
same thing is that one saying that they

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,950
are not same thing user experiences the

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,980
experiences have when they interact with

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,960
your website usability is how easy it is

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,810
for them to have that interaction in the

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,050
first place they are related but they're

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:13,240
not the same so you should always be

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,310
thinking about usability and that one it

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,550
affects both branding and user

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,690
experience but you shouldn't just think

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:25,390
about usability there's way more thought

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,120
so the core of user experience is

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,460
ensuring that users find value in what

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,250
you're providing to them that is the

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,230
goal when we think about user experience

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,670
thinking about the user making sure that

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,210
they're doing something out of what

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,270
they're doing

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:46,030
that old possible utility that would use

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:48,550
the happen websites faculty day so there

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,900
are some ways to define and determine

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:55,330
whether the website you have right a

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,510
good user experience number first

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,040
question is it useful do they come to a

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,970
website and they don't immediately

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,230
saying wow that was

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,910
in my time number two is it usable are

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,860
they able to navigate through the

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,130
website without having any obvious

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,820
problems and glitches number three isn't

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:21,620
desirable when they got to the website

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:25,730
they go that's number four and the final

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,950
this means both from the SEO perspective

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,770
and they get to your website without too

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:33,770
much searching also from the on-page

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,510
search option when they are looking for

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,790
specific information within your website

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,530
are they able to find it without much

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:45,140
after the five it accessible and they

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,930
open your website on their tablet on

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,520
their computer and on your mobile you

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,020
want to be able to access that

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,750
information wherever they are

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,120
at whatever type of you know level there

00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,820
are during their act and that's very

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,820
important to user experience the last

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:09,410
because no one likes faith is just no

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,690
random stuff in your website people will

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:17,080
get irritated or point down user

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,950
experience will determine how people

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,669
interact with the

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,940
breathily just forgetting the whole

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,529
conversation about branding even if you

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,019
only have a product or service and it

00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,549
doesn't really have a brand your user

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,769
experience is going to determine whether

00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,090
you have repeat visitors and hot if

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,980
they're not it's having a good

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,899
experience they won't come back to tell

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,759
you so now that we've talked about over

00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:45,039
branding you care and the people

00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,320
experience you want to talk about the

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,509
tools that work the word press that

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,940
we're going to help with these things

00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:58,119
okay first is I will say I do work with

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,169
this company slick planet and although

00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:04,119
they hate me I also use the product so I

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,419
was speaking from personal experience as

00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:09,879
well as I'm gonna cry but I like to send

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,659
something out there my journalistic

00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:16,090
background so I don't but the plan is a

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:18,009
wasn't planning tool and it helps with

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,210
user experience we've done this point to

00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:24,369
make the websites more beautiful useful

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,269
findable it's based on information

00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:30,549
architecture which is the science that

00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:34,119
the fact that studies how people access

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:36,830
information and the best ways to do that

00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,890
and so it has a lot of tools for

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:44,809
information architects or people who

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:48,320
want to flip plan plans you can create

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:50,240
bike maps plan content talking playing

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,710
knocks it out diagram your site

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,149
structure and construct design mock-up

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,039
because it's going to help the country's

00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,529
ability it will likely help influence

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,860
your branding if you're trying to brand

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:07,490
you have a better grant experience it is

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,860
a plug-in available for WordPress this

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,139
problem split planning quarter as a

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,389
30-day trial and the price is based on

00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:17,630
the number of users that pack so it

00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:19,970
works and that is a quite welcome the

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:23,210
next one is Yoast which I'm sure most of

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,940
you are familiar with yo is a search

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,370
engine optimization software and it too

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,370
can help with both branding and the user

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,940
experience obviously you know just

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,980
wanting to help with my ability just you

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,620
know make your s feel better but I hope

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,370
there but it can also improve branding

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:45,590
because when you have the right stuff

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,299
showing up with search and people click

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,940
on that and they actually come to a

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:52,460
website that is exactly what this virtue

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,250
Bell said it should be that makes them

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,740
happy and that's when differently a good

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,320
a good experience it's also going to

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,769
reinforce the actual identity of this

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,960
gram that you're trying to go out there

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:08,870
this title comes into play when you see

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,630
people a branding specialist personal

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,710
branding specialist who will go and

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,630
dirty

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,309
well I don't look depressing that before

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,230
but if you have like negative things

00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,090
written about the Hylian and their job

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,679
is just to go in and hide it so that

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,240
when you search when people search for

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,480
your name they don't see the negative

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,210
stuff so yo can basically do that from

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,159
your system it help you manage that so

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,659
that you're always showing what you want

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:39,289
people to see on your search engine

00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:44,690
results how do you think with site speed

00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:46,789
project quality and accessibility so you

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,179
can have the house with us feature the

00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:51,890
findability accessibility and it is a

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:56,240
free plug-in but there's also a free

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:59,200
energy so the next one is called

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,309
attachment custom login and this is a

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,190
plugin that lets you customize the

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:06,740
market rate and basically this is a

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,270
brand as well a branding if you haven't

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,690
ever WordPress site where people have

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,340
too long and you want them to be hit

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,970
with your brand not just the WordPress

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,980
logo I really the more people see

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,740
we'll go and they associated with this

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,970
is what this business is about this is

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,450
what this product is like say say your

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:31,130
product

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:33,409
our brand is the color purple and even

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,299
like on the login page you don't want to

00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,559
have that blue we're pressing what it

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:38,620
would be purple and have your ground

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,720
there and that just keeps the brand or

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,270
this is 20 this also has a security

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,090
which not with my pocket all but it's

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,620
very important so especially on the face

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,659
we have people walking and you want to

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,960
make sure you have this security so I

00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:57,440
had put it on here for mostly because of

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,390
the high security and goes $25 for

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:07,880
single use mice with answer five dollars

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:13,850
for a five use okay the next one Google

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:17,330
Analytics Google Analytics engine

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:20,659
optimization but in one bring user

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,490
experience because you can take the

00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,650
analytics from there but that would you

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,960
get from it and determine what type of

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,630
experience the users are having without

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,620
asking them now one of the easiest way

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,539
to learn more

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,250
another way to find out what type of

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:37,490
experience users are having a fight and

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,400
they're doing surveys and feedback in

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:43,070
different ways but other than that you

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,909
can look to data and Google Analytics is

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:50,059
free to do this so some things to look

00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:52,940
at is the bounce rate page engagement

00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,970
and actual usual slow by looking at

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,919
those pages

00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:01,440
see which pages are not working which

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,279
power they sank on site maybe this isn't

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,590
the right you have to figure out why we

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,730
image it shows you where to focus Oxley

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:15,389
and start improving how capable your

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:18,509
site is it's going to impact or branding

00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:20,820
and interference and if you use the took

00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:23,610
the grass field and that also impacted

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,799
my ability Google Analytics does have a

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:28,590
drawback it's extremely our tears if you

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,000
don't know if you doing so you want to

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,440
get someone that knows how to understand

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,940
people analytics port you can do the

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,250
training through the website which is

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,690
screening feed so batteries and

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,059
allocating the time when we learn how to

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:43,529
read it oh Emily Academy this one at

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:45,960
Google house it's free so Google

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,299
Analytics works with multiple plugins on

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,889
with WordPress so you don't have to get

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:52,289
like one specifically through the web

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:54,059
legs do start Carla's you also don't

00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:58,529
have to be the plugin just most people

00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:01,139
recommending Sam plugin then the last

00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:04,379
one is one of my favorites called spider

00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:07,620
revolution in my business I need some

00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:10,019
time to make websites for people like I

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,549
believe who would otherwise like in a

00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:15,870
website unless I tell them they have to

00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:17,170
get so I do those type of websites and I

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:23,950
have a helper

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:25,630
and he slider on the side revolution in

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,950
the swagger program and it's going to

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,980
extend the functionality of your

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:32,470
mythical content and as we exit earlier

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,630
video the pictures are extremely useful

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,760
for creating brands so they give that

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,190
personal feeling the matter what the

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,920
product is it just got like a human face

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,500
on there people like I related that so

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:49,260
why revolution makes it even easier to

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,260
cause it's a create a few labels

00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,260
it has accessibility features in

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,850
addition to that that makes it you put

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,250
the video then there and in your page to

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:03,070
load superfast it has on that your

00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,500
security features it's really easy to

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,960
have advent video picture to fight a

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,700
revolution without making your site

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,500
without moving your site thought it

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,620
extra extra stuff so I have a

00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:24,820
recommended for that as 24,000 website

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:26,830
and or you can buy all of my websites

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,610
that bill has some great little spider

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:32,830
revolution it it's great so I think that

00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:36,970
is all I have

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:39,130
oh yeah this part maybe goes oh oh I

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:49,410
have I don't care for questions because

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:49,410
I need to what

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,220
that is a great question and I can

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,640
actually only know so what I personally

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:12,610
do I like very Irene dealing very very

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:18,279
low-tech people there are a lot of

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:19,870
different ways to get good luck high in

00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,580
technique and I would recommend it to

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,700
what if you want to really answer to

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,500
that it's a no slip plans log and we

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,130
have a lot of tutorial I put my personal

00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,450
thing to answer your question okay well

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,980
if someone comes Mason they want a

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,929
website and I want to make sure that I'm

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,330
branding it correctly on who your ideal

00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:40,570
target based feet first question I have

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:43,149
is for your competitors if they're if

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,970
they have competitors then they probably

00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:49,090
have some more customers and then I look

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,370
at where those customers are going if

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,399
you filled with it I go really deep and

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:57,010
then I would go the next website that

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,870
the competitors website and then see

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,690
where their traffic is coming from and

00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,850
see what their traffic whatever website

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,590
stated that perhaps I pulled it at the

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,200
social media sites and see what other

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,180
pages

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,390
white and a little bit what type of

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:14,810
people like that company that all the

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:17,840
connections and you can work out and he

00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:20,950
studied the competitor research he

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,510
studied the language that they use

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,030
everything all of that you study all of

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,200
em branding figure out of a how are they

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,970
being their customers

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,100
do we want those customers because we

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,080
want to go after something different and

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:37,190
we have that discussion and figure out

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,200
okay who's Arthur it was I believe it

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,850
was easy because he had an experience

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,650
from campaign he just did trade show

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,540
that there's everything and he could

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,660
tell me whose customers were to describe

00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,610
to me and then I got tired home and I

00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,840
got to know L more better a lot of times

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,930
I really see the lack of getting to know

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,700
the business arm figure out what they're

00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,520
about and then I just Brandon down

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:03,610
specifically rather and work it out that

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,610
way did I answer it thank you

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,910
[Applause]

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:21,390
yeah he's part of that that's why they

00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,390
like the best

00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,480
yeah that would try to drive me crazy

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:33,240
most of you I started with they don't

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,980
okay wait first white said they have no

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,000
more grammar they built they have

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,470
multiple way design right the brand is

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,799
going to be what other people think of

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,779
them what if they have been established

00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,279
for a while and they have customers you

00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:49,320
know what I would do is go after your

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,929
customers and find out what exactly it's

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,200
ticking it's kind of the same way that's

00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,860
what SEO guys do when they as tell

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,100
people that these glimpses Brett but

00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:04,200
every sit with anything people try to

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,929
figure out which page is worth keeping

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,240
they go and look at how much faculties

00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:10,679
come in on it you know and they decide

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,179
which one is keeping based on what

00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,089
actually meeting them like it's the same

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:19,129
idea with Brandon which image is working

00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:19,129
for the best right

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,889
are you just do an a/b testing right you

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,840
can come up with a few ideas different

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,609
designs throw it out there

00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,040
social media is a great way to the back

00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:36,659
so it's not commit of committing so you

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,909
just spit out some different identities

00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,490
to roll out you invite some people like

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,440
and then make the website around that or

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,419
make multiple website will whole landing

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,010
pages see this one is kind of

00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,010
responsible and then make website

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:37,539
yeah absolutely so you're wondering when

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,369
you're working with small businesses how

00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:42,849
do you explain to them that they need to

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:47,880
be concerned about user experience and

00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,880
so Kay yeah painted extra money for it

00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,390
personally what people who don't really

00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:57,910
care about that much I really give them

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,769
actual examples and one thing I with you

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:04,059
I mean depending on the person I work

00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:06,190
with but say what they think what the

00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:09,249
business you say for a real estate

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:12,160
business perhaps we have to do with the

00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:13,479
MLS right say these terminology that

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,279
they're familiar with makes make them

00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:18,099
feel like they know things you on the

00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:24,819
same page so oh yeah you ever had to go

00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:26,890
on the MLS website yeah and a little bit

00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:29,769
about it for a minute and be like wow

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,890
you how many real estate agents are very

00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:34,960
here in your area and then you know them

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,390
talk about that and so if someone had a

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,950
choice and they had to go to our website

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,230
or your

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,809
looks like the MLS Monday you think

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,910
don't go away that something go from

00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:47,799
them to understand their own frustration

00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,329
that they feel and then put that back on

00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,250
them to make them feel like the customer

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:54,910
they're trying to get and sometimes that

00:36:51,250 --> 00:37:24,910
works it took me a while to convince the

00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:27,520
overriding to the website that is the

00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,170
very good question and I will say there

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,020
were definitely our other two oversized

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,549
Google Analytics I will also say that I

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,650
can't name off the top of my head

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:40,270
because I don't work as an ux analyst

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,549
and UX analyst with telling that I chose

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:48,000
Google because the screen in is easiest

00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:50,380
for most people but yes there definitely

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,079
you can either reach out to me correctly

00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,790
I would ask excellent plan on Monday and

00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,250
they will tell me I will have it will

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,700
not

00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,990
answer that question or you can check

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:26,140
their website out that's what I

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:26,140
recommend for with that thank you

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,700
you think want pass-qa and pdas to not

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,700
look as well

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:26,600
again a little bit more than I do I

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,890
actually do any X and Alex point my I

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:33,780
more focus on branding with me

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,490
personally but I think then they knew

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,620
Mike's mastery to web sites popping in

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,390
my head is one of the good one that have

00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,690
they have these type of discussions and

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,560
like okay what is a good ways to improve

00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:48,480

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,670
there's I should have had that but there

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,700

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,530

00:39:52,700 --> 00:40:07,130
