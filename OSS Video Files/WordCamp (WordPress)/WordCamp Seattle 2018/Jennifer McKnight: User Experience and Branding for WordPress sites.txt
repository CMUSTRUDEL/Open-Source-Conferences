Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	While WordPress makes it easy to build just about anything, the content you eventually place on that site will determine it’s effectiveness. This talk will explain the basics of UX website design as it relates to WordPress, with an emphasis on the impact of branded content. It will also suggest ways to easily incorporate UX design and branding into the sites you build.
In addition to these topics, I’ll also share some WordPress-compatible tools that help improve a site’s UX, overview the relationship between user experience and SEO, and provide a takeaway that designers can use to help create branded, UX-friendly content for their sites.
