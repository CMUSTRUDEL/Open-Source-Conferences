Title: Justin Nealey: Fast Track Your Design Process
Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	As a fellow WordPress designer, I know how much time it takes to work with a client and get a website created. It can feel like an eternity with the initial consult, getting the pieces together, creating the rough draft to their requirements, presenting the rough draft, going back and forth with updates, and so on.
While there’s no cure to make all of this automated, there is a way to shave countless hours and throw remedial tasks out the window. In this talk, I’ll go over my approach to streamline the WordPress design process allowing you to be more efficient, build sites quicker, and even handle more clients.

that's really where I got

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,310
WordPress homicide hospital as well I

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,860
have quite a bit of side hustles from

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,920
anything from like helping startups to

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,619
designing sites or cost almost a coffee

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,920
shop once that was a nothing for me

00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:43,659
there all that back to WordPress again

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,210
WordPress enthusiasts for over seven

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,700
years but I didn't really experience the

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,430
the in real life IRL WordPress

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,560
experience until earlier this year I got

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,590
to help out at work Camp Phoenix I was

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,619
as the lead organizer said booth babe

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,119
coming out and GoDaddy booth I got to

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,860
experience just how awesome this

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,110
community is and how helpful everyone is

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,300
just just the support was overwhelming

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,830
it didn't matter what we did or who

00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,690
you're from and we're all here for the

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,600
right reasons that's just to help each

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,820
other grow shameless plug for Camp

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,280
Phoenix organizer our campus in February

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,470
so guess when we come visit a state

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,100
that's super hot in the wintertime

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,980
because it's freezing you work for me so

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,799
how I WordPress so like I said a little

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,900
bit Phoenix Arizona here so I get about

00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,060
a week of nice weather and then super

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,530
hot but in that week I'd love to kind of

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,480
just hang out my hammock

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,670
that's the WordPress sites and if I'm

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,700
not there I'm at a little coffee shop or

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,940
or this is this bar right across the

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,530
street has great Wi-Fi get a better beer

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:52,000
guys only three craft beer places

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,190
after my check about so let's jump it so

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,470
look with designing a website right the

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,780
entire process can take forever

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,820
especially if you're a designer and you

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,260
have multiple clients so you gotta have

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,300
the initial consultation

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,090
you've got the material from them the

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,770
entire store start to finish it takes a

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,560
week to operate especially just the

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,280
design get back and forth but it doesn't

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,500
have to

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,110
it doesn't have to take as long as it

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,120
does right like there are things that we

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,010
do over and over over that should

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
eliminate you shouldn't kind of easily

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,150
get a head start that's what this is top

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,550
hopefully fast tracking that design

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,040
process that the title says and give you

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,930
those countless hours back to to go tit

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,310
to easier and have your vacation to

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,340
spend time with manner whatever that

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,390
looks like so I really like to kind of

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,340
gauge the experience in the room so it's

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,830
gonna be a little hand raising affair of

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,520
the year so if you've created more than

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:54,209
10 websites frigerator a steel order

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:59,440
blossom how about 20 still that's 30

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:01,330
over 15 okay it's super tender I love it

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,280
so we don't know how how long that

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,739
process takes and some take even longer

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,049
in the nation so I'm a big statistics

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,060
guy I have a podcast that I ran back and

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,290
I was always coming up with statistics

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,180
my buddy would make fun of me because

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,090
that's just what I did

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,130
so some stats how long does it take to

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,940
create WordPress site this is from toe

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:25,570
first three of our mwp show so a dead

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,200
simple blog they see no customizations

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,780
to our

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,970
were they doing much into it right the

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,100
informational psychic all about contact

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,280
via blog and I've barely lately

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,410
customized me is eight hours a simple

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,510
ecommerce site that's twenty hours and

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,120
then press calm that can take anywhere

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:47,350
from a few days to a few weeks to great

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,270
website that's a long time so look at as

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,070
I look at just trying to be more

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,570
efficient so I can handle more clients

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,730
or just get more free time breaks I'm a

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,370
site buster I have a full time job

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,350
plus many websites if I let it that's my

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,700
entire life like that I don't want and

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,940
so I looked at it and try to figure out

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:08,350
what do I do and what I found is we're

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,210
setting up probably the same plugins

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,880
themes WordPress settings on almost

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,280
every building and then setting up our

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,100
page brain work so so not so much like

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,930
the actual client customizations were

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,150
just getting the overall flow of how I

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,810
want the page to look I did that over

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,220
and over and over and as a designer I

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,140
pretty much have had like the same style

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,810
ready to do some of the same things over

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,430
and over so based on that question I

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,780
asked you guys really the ratio managed

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,220
done within 10 sites maybe 30 and 50 if

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,070
you build more than 10 sites it's

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,370
roughly 25 to 60 hours we're doing the

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,680
exact same thing that's how the

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,650
looniversity like length do the math if

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,280
I had 25 to 60 hours right now I can do

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,340
so much probably most of Italy sleep but

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,850
the bad news is that time flies right

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,770
the good news is I love this book and we

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,830
have we have the power of the controller

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,950
to me and what we do with it so I want

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,190
to tell you all about about that story

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,550
but so when I was I got a first-time new

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,010
designer about six

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,200
you're at somewhere that Rick Thanks I

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,480
wanted to really impress my clients as

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,070
welcome home I want to do everything

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,460
from scratch they literally everything

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,250
the best theme CSS and creepin on child

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,720
needs to be best for CSS I'm trying to

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,140
make my own plugins well I did all that

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,600
and it was colossal mess so I wanna tell

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,060
you about a time where it didn't didn't

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
work out for me right so I had a client

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm gonna call him frankness in this

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,460
example here to hide his identity but I

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,770
had a client named Frank and it was a

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,020
friend of a friend he was a startup

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,490
business consultant and he's been

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,370
preaching to his clients you have to

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,170
have a powerful website present right to

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,180
kind of loud in customers but he didn't

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,270
have one right I think the cobbler shoe

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,190
that kids have their shoes so he let me

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,670
talk to me and say hey I really need a

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,290
website

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,690
I need basically backed up when I'm

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,160
talking about so I'm like great let's

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,170
absolutely do it so he goes through the

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,820
consultation figure out what he wants he

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,870
wants basically just a place that to

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,610
show off his brand

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,650
he wants a couple little courses you can

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,690
add to it and a membership site so he

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,240
has its clients there so no cool go

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,810
ahead and do it let's go ahead and make

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,070
this happen

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,900
go starts going gonna work right I went

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,880
out still let me be designer I went out

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,920
and found this it's brand new theme that

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,720
had this what I thought at the time

00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,850
would be this cool like visual builder

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,590
does automatic and he created it in I

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,810
found some new membership plugins that I

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,320
had worked with before so I thought they

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,690
were super cool looking and I started to

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,330
work and what I found was that theme was

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,820
offline it was just atrocious like the

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,680
Builder inside of it wasn't it didn't

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,630
flow out and click and drag things over

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,900
and over and over I do different browser

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:07,800
here's why my plugins never start then

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,380
it was just chaos Hurley and I had the

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,270
poem by weekend house

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,740
so I showed him what that something was

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,910
he's like what is this like you're right

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,490
I get it

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,240
right it's been a struggle but I'm gonna

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,100
make this happen

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,530
we'll get it done so I keep going

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,660
another there are five days ago by I

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,940
sort of got the home page going surround

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,850
the contact the courses aren't working

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,349
that well your mess the CSS to make it

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,010
presentable order this name

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:39,500
I just wasn't right and I was literally

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,030
looking like this guy just head hand to

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,120
the head just like I don't know what to

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,070
do i I was at a point where I thought to

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,080
myself maybe I just stick with my

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,350
full-time job maybe this isn't for me

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,210
because I ain't even failing car so then

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,860
I talked to him like hey and I really

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,690
don't have much ham to show you but

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,850
giving it another day or two and I'll

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,620
have something oh I have something that

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,920
I'll be proud to show the great

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,720
that's my work that way so sit there and

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm trying to think how the hell do I

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,080
get out of this I've already spent a

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,790
week a half week and a half of my time

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,400
and I really don't have much to show for

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,280
it I don't have much to say that hey at

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,640
least I got a song so I remember I had a

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,800
client about three or four months back

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,570
then I kind of similar it was in a

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,830
startup business consulting but it was a

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,420
consultant of some sort

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,940
I already doing the theme that they were

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,150
using any other plugins so so what did I

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:37,130
do

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:39,950
I stole for myself right I stole some

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,649
designs i cloned it threw it over and

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,959
then

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,389
to last it to Frank's liking like

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,610
everything he was trying to do I had the

00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,910
membership set up I had the the courses

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,980
I had his his face on the homepage look

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,809
beautiful right and I presented it to

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,360
him and then that process took you

00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:59,550
probably four or five hours to do a

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,369
redesign to make after a week and a half

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,149
of headache and he was so happy and I

00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:08,879
was like this mess I made him an

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,889
employer out I was about quick but I

00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,050
decided too soon for myself and try

00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:16,319
something new and do what I already knew

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,600
and go from there and that whole

00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,730
experience was the start of something

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,399
magical right and that's exactly what my

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,689
baby basic teaching you all to do don't

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,029
Felice Kip through that essentially

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,399
still for yourself and you want the way

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,819
you do that is you create a template

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,579
library so as a designer you've built a

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:38,910
variety of different sites over 50 for a

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:41,309
lot of you so you create your own

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,899
template library all your plugins that

00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,879
are set up that you pretty much use them

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,559
every single day that we all have our

00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,050
security plugins we use a lot our

00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,730
optimization plugins we use you go and

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,709
set up basically the same settings most

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,110
and every time and then same thing is

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:56,970
your theme great you set up your your

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,370
template to have the couple themes that

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,110
you use settings already set and the

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,269
pages as well instead of just the

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,699
frameworks not Leslie the customizations

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,350
the frameworks of the page that you have

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,589
to your big hero image your

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,259
call-to-action in contact what happened

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,300
and then as I was great this talk and I

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,880
was trying to find

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,570
people that already do this and to this

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,060
credit Li well and it's not so much

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,250
other designers that are doing it it's

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,830
being $2 right if you ever look at a

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,200
theme demo site they've already created

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,190
that template library so that's what I'm

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,140
going to teach you to kind of create

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,700
that same model so where you look at two

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,270
different models that two methods of

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,910
madness

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,980
so the first being a beta beta is one of

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,410
the most popular themes on themeforest

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,080
but what they do is they have they're

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,740
basically they have a hub website as

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,230
their demo page and a ton of example of

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,600
our home page versions like on this they

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,100
have 19 different home page versions and

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
it's not for them it's for people that

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,510
get that theme and it gets our permit

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,220
and build onto it for there same thing

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,080
with you all create your hub website

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,180
create a couple different versions of

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,180
your home page however you guys

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,890
typically do it right and then you have

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,440
a new client you've met it from there

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,930
so beta has all sorts of different

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,580
versions of their website and that

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,320
people that use they see the same thing

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,600
have a couple different versions of your

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,930
website that you can use and start from

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,020
and skip all that remedial stuff to do

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,610
with every time right the that's the

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,070
person would have a hub and then

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,460
multiple versions of your page the

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,050
second way is B so B things instead of

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,810
having just one site with a ton of

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,640
different pages they have different

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,670
websites with different versions on that

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,470
site right so with just their looking at

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,110
their demo vision their default theme

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,670
kind of a tailor cakes there's Burger

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,060
ocean I'm super hungry luncheons right

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,620
after this school coffee ages in cars

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,170
they have different versions of their

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,390
site tailored to different potential

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,670
clients that want that theme so you do

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,230
the same thing so if you have a site

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,540
that you do for restaurants you have a

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,780
different restaurant type sites maybe

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,580
you can do some car salesman tank right

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,760
so look what have you what about a

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,590
lipstick so if I had a restaurant client

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,260
I would just spin up my that's the

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:21,570
burger site or labor page that I create

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,120
as my template and then I'll edit it

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,160
from there allow me to save that time to

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,870
use to don't find more clients or just

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,400
relax so to break your template library

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,370
there there's a lot of different ways to

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,440
do this right I'm going to show you guys

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,310
how to do a cPanel login a couple shots

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,140
of other ways frozen content so if you

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,750
if you don't like using backup plugins

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,340
such as they attract this one sent a

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,290
pretty pop they're back up plugging you

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,970
can create your your website your

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,100
template site and it's create as a

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,750
backup so you spin up and you say you

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,440
just restore that backup and then build

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,620
on from there

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,990
right the downside of this is that your

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,640
plugins and themes don't stay updated so

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,250
that's something kind of keep an eye on

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,500
because if you haven't messed up a while

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,960
you didn't update like 12 plugins and

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,910
themes things can break so I wouldn't

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,520
recommend this one but if by all means

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,960
use what's what you like best

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,850
there's multi-site management tools such

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,300
as and you know then you can create

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,370
these the backups and spin up and clone

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,050
there's managed WP or go many pro's Pro

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,900
sites template builder that kind of does

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,610
this the same exact thing again I'm

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,830
gonna show the new cPanel it's pretty

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,430
universal to a variety of hosting

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,550
companies that almost anyone can use so

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,350
inside of you know there's this section

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,379
called install track it's your home

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,660
first

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,549
applications and whatnot right so we're

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,149
gonna go ahead and just install a new

00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:51,279
wordpress building go ahead and throw

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,499
the details what domain you're using

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,589
whatever recommend is having an example

00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:58,659
site like my would be like example dot

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:01,359
Neely got proof of my actual site right

00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:02,829
so I'd make my just my example side of

00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,619
my template site however you wanted to

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,899
do it the username password guys the

00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:10,149
whole nine yards and go over to this but

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,419
with with creating your template library

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,579
so my recommendation unless you your

00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:18,039
sites are vastly different usually you

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:19,749
make a model use the the one site with

00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,729
their version writing different pages so

00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:23,679
you can kind of just delete the extra

00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:25,869
ages and customize from there it's gonna

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,179
make your lives a lot easier and then

00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:31,599
kind of as you grow and expand you can

00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:34,329
do what I typically do so I'll have my

00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:37,929
example site that has my variety of her

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,549
pages my home pages my contact about a

00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,799
plugins are you set up so on and so

00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:44,099
forth and then I'll clone a site and

00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,689
create an e-commerce version of it

00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,970
commerce have the demo products

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,949
customize the pages to look like that an

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,019
e-commerce site and I'll take that and

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,299
clone it again and make it one per site

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,069
I'm sorry membership site right if you

00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:59,019
have different types of version that

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,879
might require a little functionality you

00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:02,500
do this and then these sites would be

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,150
lives then you can make your

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,610
if you're plugging into what not real

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,050
time so you don't have to go potentially

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,320
a great new build because that's that

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,110
cost even more headache but in so on so

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,610
for so any other potential genres of

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,990
site you can do is to keep closing your

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,080
temple clone your type of cloning your

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,960
time so how do you use this in the wild

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,280
so you have a client and now you don't

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,920
want to do from scratch want to use one

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:30,430
of your templates so we're going to talk

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,890
about these as a fictitious client but

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,040
for my example here absolutely stinking

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:39,330
City website she's a health nut she just

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,250
got certified to be a personal

00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,990
nutritionist thank you so she can be a

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,610
nutritionist so she wants a place to

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,440
basically show off her ring engine off

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,930
what she does so we go through the whole

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,170
consultation fees they haven't talked up

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:56,020
get material and go to work I'm going to

00:16:53,170 --> 00:17:00,160
use install a trial to clone my temple

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,780
to rehearsing right so inside of install

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,570
as you're on you can go ahead and click

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,700
that little arrow with the the to

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,160
splitting arrows it's going to take an

00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,200
exact replica of that site and do the

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,090
heavy lifting of the search or place so

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,730
it's gonna replace the URLs with your

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:17,950
your new ones you have to go do that

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,290
makes your life super easy so if you're

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,700
hosting the the website for your client

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,070
you would just choose their domain name

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:27,760
and then builder them there but if

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:31,330
you're doing a staging type site choose

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,110
your template domain and then

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,539
and then you go through whatever

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,309
settings you want to do or just let them

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:40,039
manage your cells and then click close

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:41,539
it'll spin up takes probably 30 seconds

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,490
to a minute to actually clone the the

00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,710
site over you have your new building all

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,820
your plugins already set up no extra

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,590
lift you have to do there other than

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,630
maybe a couple of tweaks depending on

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,980
what you use your themes over there we

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,299
have one two three themes that you are

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,970
to set up so you can't really go and

00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,980
pick which ones works best for you I'm

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,960
going to kind of clean up you customize

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,150
this so you have extra agents that

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,620
you're not going to want to use so go

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,870
ahead and delete those extra pages that

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,730
you not gonna use complete many other

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,770
themes that you have to use do you want

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,600
the Nexus below and then leave any

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,140
plugins you may not eat on this bill

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,470
right so and then I'll end up with this

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,600
plugin list for example I have a three

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,730
lazy load just for optimization there's

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,220
a lot of optimization stuff that he's at

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,110
optimized element or element approach

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,730
because it's super easy to hand out to a

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,510
client love them make their credits from

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:35,450
there manage WP worker so I can back up

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,419
into my second stuff smush again

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,330
optimization security security mouthful

00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:43,580
just for my Security's preferences

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,960
I have web crafted clear fly helps get

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,630
rid of some of the excess that I don't

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,510
really need on the wordpress build and

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,830
Yoast heard for SEO then machines will

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,140
go ahead and switch

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,000
depending on which one I would use again

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,630
pages you can't believe extra pages and

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,790
customize from there so I'll take a just

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,980
generic website template that I've had

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,290
built in my library for a while ago and

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,210
she gave me her color scheme she gave me

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,790
her images that she wants to use in some

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,860
of the texts on right I didn't spend a

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,299
whole lot of time really customizing

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,280
this for a fictitious client

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,429
so for example they're gonna look pretty

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,620
similar so I go ahead and I spin up

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,360
through a ribbon on the back I increased

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,970
the the header space move in social is

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,070
more of her I'll add the little content

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,620
that she's given me as some images and

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,440
text now with this what you don't want

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,090
to do is just literally copy

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,770
cookie-cutter every website and all your

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,330
sites will look the same that's not what

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,710
this is for right it's just to help get

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,990
you that head start so you can go and

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,460
customize it to that clients need I had

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,950
extra stuff you're gonna add extra stuff

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:50,030
like go out at least save those hours

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,410
right so and then you just migrate the

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,120
website to your client

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,950
so use a tool that you're familiar with

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,809
if you like backup plugins then go

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,940
traffic used to use backup logins use

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,890
install Tron there's a sort of a

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,820
migration path doesn't always work the

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,620
best

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,260
you know old-school if you really want

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,299
to an FTP and my sequel and do certain

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,000
places please I wouldn't recommend it

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,420
there's a ton of time multi-site

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,090
management tools or

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,090
I can help manage it over as well so

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,980
with this right when I really started to

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,930
do this I almost felt like I was

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,580
treating my clients I was charging the

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,070
same amount but it's taking me a lot

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,050
less time and that that's a valid

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,790
feeling to have especially when you're

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,560
using your own library

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,830
I don't want you to feel that way I want

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,560
to tell you about a story that somebody

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,770
really told me that really hit home so

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,110
we have we have this this small business

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,960
owner he needs a logo so he goes around

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:50,650
search around and finds signs this logo

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,750
designer and he goes to the office talks

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,420
term and goes great on this Louis my

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,060
business is all the information she goes

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,600
perfect that can absolutely absolutely

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,730
make you a little bit you can be proud

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,710
500 bucks and make it happen as quickly

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,540
as possible so you guys are great at

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,090
that that sounds pretty good

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,910
here's the 500 bucks look at a hat his

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:15,460
body so she goes one second she sits

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,650
down takes about 15 minutes and creates

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,020
a beautifully stomach look don't get me

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,160
wrong we're creating 15 minutes she goes

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,760
here you go

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,160
and she used kind of pissed off he's

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,460
like you spent 15 minutes for my 500

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,220
bucks

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,220
what why would I pay that and she goes

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,460
ten minutes of work you pay for this she

00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,230
goes opens up her closet door and out

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,820
pours out hundreds of hundreds and

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,040
artwork and paintings and logos

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,660
everything that she's done to get to

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,179
that point where she can make you a damn

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,460
good or the logo in 15 minutes right

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,200
that's what you're paying for same thing

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,670
with this your clients are paying for

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,710
your experience just because you get it

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,150
done a lot quicker they're probably

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,880
going to be happier they don't delete as

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,530
long right so that that's that's where

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,760
they want you to take away with don't

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,500
feel like you're cheating your clients

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,790
because you are using your own template

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,679
that you created that's your experience

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,510
you're still going to customize to them

00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,160
that websites still gonna be beautiful

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,020
at the end of the day and they're gonna

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,910
get it done a lot quicker then you can

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,160
focus on building up their brand or

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:20,960
whatever other services have gone and

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,390
with that extra time or go into TV so

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,370
that that's the that's the essence of my

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,350
talk we'll do a little Q&A in case

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,179
anyone has pushed at the end but there's

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,669
really four levels of takeaways that I

00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:34,280
want you to have from this talk so look

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,090
one walking away saying that wasn't a

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,330
complete waste of time

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:41,000
that's my bare minimum right level to

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,309
try to send these ones see the works for

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,410
you it does it'll take you to level

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,410
three and use this with all your bullets

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,910
save that time expedite the process and

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,510
become more efficient with your websites

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,919
and then level floor is the one I really

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,750
want you all to do it is to teach

00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,799
someone else that's the power of

00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,210
WordPress that's the power of the

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,679
community and we're in we're all here to

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,630
help each other and support each other

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,640
and teach each other so if this works

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,169
for you go ahead and teach someone else

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,440
or anything you've learned from today

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,750
and really like touched you teach

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,850
someone else help them out see if you

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,590
can bring them their new couple little

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,510
pro tips or even though one is a huge

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,350
training course for all I care they do

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,390
something to help each other out right

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,470
so again at just Amelie talked to me on

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,210
Twitter help me have to go to a tea

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,450
booth if you guys have any

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,249
and to make questions are just on top

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,139
but that's all I have for you we'll do

00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:48,080
some Q&A if in case anybody had asked

00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:50,240
questions no questions I usually use

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,590
commercial names so I have been three

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,580
relying on Evita

00:23:51,590 --> 00:24:01,690
Hestia and then Diddy or some customers

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:01,690
clients yeah

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,600
so I mess around with multi cycle works

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,880
one of my side muscles was essentially

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,230
my customers would need for a temple

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,170
that would spin up and then they built

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,580
in air so yes I have tried that I like

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:31,540
just having everything pretty separate

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:33,190
but multi cycle the other questions for

00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:38,440
Less logo I know such time we're all

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:41,070
getting antsy yes do you find all your

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,630
tech start looping the same methodology

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:47,170
they get at first it took me a little

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:49,240
bit to really make them my own I was

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,590
trying to be quick with it right well

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,580
then you start to kind of get your basic

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,680
framework and then you'll add your

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,200
different sections and then try to look

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,000
at my bypassing three or four designs to

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,430
make sure it doesn't if you can does

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,080
them towards their brand CS it's

00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,370
absolutely a thing especially just

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,190
getting started with it we can take a

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:15,340
little bit of time to make it your own

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:17,890
but then your know as all over that's

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,270
what I was gonna do the beefy method

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,540
with the multiple versions of the page

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,010
but I keep my templates that one was the

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,470
really old one but most of my actual

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,330
templates are super generic that I can

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,590
then spin off to wear whatever they need

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,590
to do yeah

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,030
yes I actually prefer that I don't like

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,460
to host my clients websites she

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,620
basically asked if I might give this up

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,960
place the site's over to my client or

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,330
keep it in-house I'll use like our

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:53,630
GoDaddy pro tools to help that migration

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:55,860
or use whatever works best for you yes

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,570
almost due to maintenance services on

00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,700
top of it I'd rather have everything in

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:06,570
their control I don't want to own their

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:08,010
stuff I think it's theirs again thank

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,710

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,779
