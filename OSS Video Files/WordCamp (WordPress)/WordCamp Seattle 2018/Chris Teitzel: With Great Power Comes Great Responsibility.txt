Title: Chris Teitzel: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
Publication date: 2020-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	As developers, we are capable of many amazing feats. We can create experiences that touch the lives of millions, brings aid to the corners of the world, empowers new businesses and bring a voice to the voiceless. WordPress powers over 30% of the entire web! However with this capability, we must also take on the responsibility for the people, and data, we interact with.
During this session, we’ll discuss how a culture of security can benefit not only your organization but also protect your end users and yes even the world. We’ll look at the ethics of privacy, secure web design and architecture, and the impact our decisions have on the community and our users. Mixed in will be best practices for secure coding, how to manage sensitive data from clients and users, compliance with various regulations and laws around privacy, and how to foster a culture of security even while you manage distributed teams. I’ll share my experiences from almost a decade in Open Source and some of the mistakes and successes I’ve had along the way.
Most of all, as WordPress continues to empower more and more of our digital world, it is up to us to decide as a community how we will use this influence and together we can work to make the world a better and safer place for people no matter where they come from.

with Krista title my power comes great

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,870
responsibility

00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,000
chris is a third-generation tech nerd

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,400
having used computer since before he was

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,780
in school he tried to escape the pull of

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,570
his genes by obtaining a bachelor's

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,460
degree in molecular biology however

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,949
didn't last long before he thumbs up

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,480
pulled back into tech having been around

00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,190
computers his whole life and equipped

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,500
with the background in science he has a

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,020
passion for using technology to better

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,640
the lives of those he meets chris has

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,620
been involved in an open-source

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,659
development for a number of years where

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,929
he is focused on data privacy and

00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:41,569
security with Ebola demystifying proper

00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:43,370
data protection career attrition this

00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:46,190
led him to create his latest company

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,230
Walker where he is currently the founder

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,860
and CEO it's new a round of applause for

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,579
[Music]

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,589
[Applause]

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,620
my claim two things my grandpa started

00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:59,030
the idea that these my dad thought he

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,069
could get away became a science teacher

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,049
two years later he started IBM he's not

00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:08,600
a security seven-tier by the end I said

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:10,310
this I mean from a doctor and then I at

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,420
some point I'll get an idea employee

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,640
just because but today we're going to

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,160
talk about with great power comes great

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,040
responsibility and I still remember the

00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,370
day that my dad called me down to the

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,460
garage

00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,130
and had a moving boxer he opens up the

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,420
movie box I can still smell the smell of

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,280
old paper and inside was his comic

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,650
collection from when he was a kid and

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,410
we're talking a regional Fantastic

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,040
Four's it's spider-man and Batman Batman

00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,970
vs. spider-man which

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,910
you know existed but in the 60s and 70s

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,070
everything went I guess and so as a kid

00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,690
I grew up reading these and then hiding

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,670
myself tying to excellent spider-man and

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,130
Superman one of my favorites actually

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,820
was the the demoscene event series and

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,400
so growing up I always had this concept

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,149
of like what is a superhero and how how

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:13,470
these superheroes act and why do we as

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,480
people put superheroes on vessel I

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,830
talked about this for a little bit a

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,950
little bit of background I've been a

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,140
Drupal for nine years starting to make

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,640
the conversion it's not only there yet

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,950
but in the last 12 years have been more

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,140
more WordPress community but I'm keen

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,110
Dogon people can't blend it in this year

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,060
and was talking about protective of

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,370
being superheroes as a way to empower

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,770
developers but as I went through the

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,830
year I started thinking more and more

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,070
about the idea that if we're superheroes

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,110
when it comes with the responsibility so

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,989
if you look at WordPress WordPress

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,670
powers of some massive brands worldwide

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,500
brands Star Wars I mean you run start

00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,120
with fur coat is what makes Star Wars

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:04,049
live but you also change the world

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,239
your code is what's delivering powerful

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:11,790
news to people every day of their lives

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:14,340
and so I came to this realization in the

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,830
last year or so that what we do to many

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,040
people is pretty much the same thing in

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,880
supply and I came this realization as I

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,560
was sitting in Istanbul I was on my way

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,680
back inside a table

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,930
does from here and so I was by myself

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,659
and I said honey go find a hookah bar

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,170
and being a six-foot blonde redheaded

00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,040
pilled

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,780
white guy walking into is simple like

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,780
locals-only behind the Grand Bazaar at

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,079
hookah bar obviously I stood out quite a

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,700
bit and so they sat me down greasing

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,650
some quotes came over we started talking

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,349
and we sat there for powers we're

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,859
smoking into PT and talking about

00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:58,150
politics and religion in life and then

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:02,489
they said well what do you do and I go I

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,810
mean website isn't like this explosion

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,010
they wanted to make an e-commerce

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:12,489
website do you know how to make any

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:14,650
comments websites like jacket but

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,790
hosting he's like hosting is really hard

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,560
to do and I don't know how to close

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,630
because I know I've got friends that run

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,280
hosting company that'll always keep your

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,710
website on no matter what it is just

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,320
like I came to the realization that me

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,660
speaking about this it's like I was so

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,180
is off-the-cuff and I do move commerce

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,520
like I can build in a beverage store but

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,530
some people who don't know what we do it

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,400
is a very very powerful thing and it's

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,930
the same thing Superman fly and so as I

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,000
started to think about that I started to

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,699
think we have the same duty to use those

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,050
powers to protect the people who don't

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:52,120
have them as superheroes do and the

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,490
reason why is because some men are

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,720
looking for anything aren't looking for

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,240
anything logical like money

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,310
they can't be bought bullied reasoned or

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,229
negotiated with some men just want to

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,449
watch the world burn and then

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,240
unfortunately we

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,520
people in our community outside of our

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,680
community and so we need to use the

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,900
technology that we have power that we

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,259
have with it to make the world a better

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,809
place

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,199
it's all new Benz famous line is with

00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:20,219
great power comes great responsibility

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,699
and so that's the title of the talk

00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:26,430
today now I'm going to ask some

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,009
questions and I'm not gonna really have

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,550
all the answers I'm kind of taking you

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,529
on my journey here so I hope that this

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,039
kind of sparks conversation there's a

00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:41,849
Q&A like beanbags lounge back there love

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,339
to talk more but I hope this is more of

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:46,469
a conversation starter than you know

00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,729
this is Chris's flag at the ground what

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:53,159
is ethics and what should you do right

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:57,149
and so I can't start a presentation

00:05:53,159 --> 00:06:12,449
about supergirls without here to see you

00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:19,219
mine so my lovely wife but it makes me

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:19,219
think what web do I want built for them

00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:26,819
and this came to realization during this

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,110
talk work camp Europe I'm right now I'll

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,569
tell you this is the first pop that I've

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,360
ever seen the Q&A there's like tears it

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:36,810
was like a therapy session upon therapy

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,469
session so go watch this a lot of the

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,389
talk today is I like to say you know the

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,399
the classic phrases you stand on the

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,229
shoulders of giants morons or those

00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,930
giants in the communities so definitely

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,180
go watch this but the ability to create

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,029
and the ability that we have in our code

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,029
comes with the ability to manipulate and

00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,849
we're seeing that a lot today so

00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,860
Facebook and Twitter started to ban Alex

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,979
Jones they are dead and folks started

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,669
screaming out oh my gosh like Twitter

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,540
and Facebook are creating what is and

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,800
what isn't on the

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,120
right Twitter got a little delayed and

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,010
their response to it but they ended up

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,890
getting on the back waiting saying no

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,770
Alex Jones isn't allowed on our platform

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:26,660
and so as they're building homes you

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:30,180
have the ability to dictate what is long

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,590
but nobody builds a twitter expecting

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,380
and Alex Jones

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,420
nobody builds a facebook expecting the

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,930
Cambridge analytic end to appear but

00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,640
they do and you know we've seen us in

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,410
WordPress as well with the the

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,300
controversy around a lot of the sanema

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,430
conspiracies that were posted on

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:54,540
wordpress.com and northern wordpress.com

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,640
and wordpress.org sensation of the

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,920
publishing and anybody can have a voice

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,870
but what happens when that voice is

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,200
destructive it's causing pain to others

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,440
and so wordpress.com updated their usage

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,320
and their terms basically say you can't

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,820
post the pictures of a minor without

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,400
their that allow them to go in and take

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,810
down a lot of the Sandy Hook

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,660
conspiracies in it I'm not gonna go down

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,250
that rabbit hole I recommend you don't

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,960
but really horrible horrible things and

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,300
WordPress was able to take them off the

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,010
web and this brings up the the idea of

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,530
butcher the Latin if anybody's a lot of

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:38,550
major or those denied I apologize but

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,140
it's Cui's custodiet Ipsos custodes and

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,080
it translates into who watches the

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,170
Watchmen so as we build and as we start

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,150
to create these platforms for publishing

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,580
we have this power to dictate what's on

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,800
them we have the power to ban somebody

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,320
and stay tied with Alex Jones he's not

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
in the App Store he's not in Google App

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,610
Store was not a twitter facebook

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,300
Instagram everything's gone wiped off

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,340
the web or the main port Ian's of it but

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,120
who watches that and who gets to dictate

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:12,089
who

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,000
say and part of this that we start right

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,490
into is that the Big Data there's a big

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,470
responsibility that sits out there if

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,660
you have a responsibility to curate and

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,750
make sure that you're providing a

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,050
platform that's going to give folks the

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,490
ability to speak you know beautiful

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,890
things about WordPress we can just build

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,230
it weather in general is that it gives a

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,850
voice for the voiceless it allows people

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,790
to publish you never have that chance

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,930
before but when you start doing that you

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,040
start from that at scale you have a

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,800
responsibility to kind of monitor and

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,120
review what you're going through and so

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,500
last year in the Economist they

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,110
published an article and has been a

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,500
couple of walks to it but their theories

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,920
and the ongoing discussion is that data

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,839
is the new oil there's more value now in

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,440
data and the data that we're collecting

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,610
in the websites that we build then is in

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,850
fossil fuels and again with that power

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,589
with that that monetary value that's

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,480
being built there's a lot of

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,750
responsibility and responsibility that

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,790
us as developers we kind of like to live

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,260
in this free world where nobody can tell

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,150
me what to do I'm just going to build

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,370
and create and I'm gonna do what I want

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,709
and that's great but then you launch it

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,230
out and all of a sudden you run into an

00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,390
issue of what happen to sivanna now how

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,430
many people know what's drop it is a

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,910
couple hands in the room so Strava is a

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:44,160
fitness tracking application so you buy

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,020
from how you walk do whatever you want

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,839
it'll track in a lot of you share with

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,700
others track your times your miles

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,190
mileage all sorts of stuff really also

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,440
have and so they came out with a global

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,870
heat map and they said we've got data

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,790
from millions of people across the world

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,459
and we're going to publish it out and

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,690
show you where the hot spots to go

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,990
riding bike

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,940
walking that's pretty cool here's the

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,000
picture of Seattle and I apologize for

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,560
the dark screen here but it kind of

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,090
shows you where the hot spots are where

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,280
people running worth a bite right you

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,020
can even see you can check the slides

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,250
online even see the ferry lines because

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,670
that's where people are traveling on the

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,160
ferries and stuff pretty cool data and

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,510
so when they first published it people

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,460
started looking at it looking around the

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,320
world and then they started looking for

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,990
Middle East and they said well there's a

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,450
couple of spots there that you wouldn't

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,090
expect to have spots they're gonna out

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,280
in the middle of Afghanistan and they

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:45,170
have these really interesting patterns

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:49,710
to them and what Strama did by accident

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:52,170
was published weird secret bases for the

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,780
military were located in Afghanistan and

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,340
Pakistan and all over because they just

00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,100
said whatever data we have were there

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,360
publish now the military personnel that

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,500
were wearing their fitbit's and their

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,420
Apple watches and everything else

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,150
weren't thinking about the fact that

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,860
they were giving data away but this is

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,630
what happens when we go out and build

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,350
really cool stuff and not think about

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,000
what are we doing so I tried the bases

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,550
are on there the unknown bases aren't on

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,840
there or the no.1 bases are actually

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,630
really cool I encourage you to go on

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,000
Strama comm slash keep Maps I believe it

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,890
is the links in those legs and you can

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,060
it's really interactive if you can zoom

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,130
around you can see everything but you

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,070
can go to parts of the world and see

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,960
where are they walking in these be safe

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,330
and so the question that you have to

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,610
think of there what are the unintended

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,960
consequences of what I build I'm gonna

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,670
go build something really cool I'm gonna

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,560
go build a stronger eat map are they

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,940
gonna build a Twitter or Facebook or

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,370
social media platform that's going to

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,680
allow anybody to publish but what

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:55,140
happens with that

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:58,140
right and collectively what's really

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,590
scary is that big data is starting to

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,680
know more about us than we know

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:08,470
our selves and one of the best anecdotes

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,960
for this is there was a father who

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,540
called up his local target and started

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,720
just screaming out of the manager how

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,020
dare you send my high school teenage

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:26,060
daughter pregnancy coupons for diapers

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,670
and prenatal medicine how dare you and

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,000
this sorry surrealism this isn't

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,410
intended really sorry really sorry the

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,050
Manta so I'm gonna look into it I'll

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,279
call you back again in a week or so and

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,080
so he called him back and said look I

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,250
don't know what happened I don't know

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,500
how they slipped through the cracks and

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,900
the dad said no I'm sorry I had to talk

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,740
to my daughter and come to find out she

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,560
is great and so much than was his target

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,620
have a great idea to say we're going to

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,250
look at people that register for our our

00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,860
our vigorously our job you know history

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,630
and what they did is every purchase that

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,240
you made it a target you got a customer

00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,920
at deed and they died to attract every

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,040
purchase that you made with their credit

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,050
cards with online in-store whatever it

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,310
all go into this ID and they would begin

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,050
attractive and they have your email

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,290
address your home address everything you

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,970
say the credit card address right and so

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,500
what they started doing is watching and

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,720
when somebody registered for the Vega

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,280
registry they then went back six months

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,170
into their purchase histories of how

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,780
they stopped buying soaps with dyes in

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,089
them they started by an unscented body

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,920
lotion and they started buying calcium

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,420
and all of these supplements that when

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,000
you find out your first pregnant you

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,130
start taking right and so they were able

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,440
to create the matrix about 20-25

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,060
products that have you bought enough of

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,120
these you would have a pregnancy score

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,250
and they would trip a advertisement that

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,280
got sent out and so what ended up

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,660
happening was the daughter who are

00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,090
she's buying all these things because

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,370
she knows she was pregnant and they

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,570
ended up sending the cute monster now

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,030
this quote came from the Forbes article

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,470
I think it's really interesting it says

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,380
we send some like a catalogue and say

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,180
congratulations on your first child and

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,470
then you never told us they're pregnant

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,130
that's gonna make a lot of people

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,280
uncomfortable

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,390
I would agree they actually got it down

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,550
to the point where they saw it if you

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,260
were buying blue or red they would say

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,800
congratulations on the baby boy baby

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:30,460
girl things that you may or may not want

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,590
them to know and then the statisticians

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,060
also put this thing we're very concerned

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,670
about her compliance with all privacy

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,260
laws but if you're following the law you

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,410
can still do things that get people

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,110
please and that's true and part of the

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,290
issue is that we in the US have a very

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:52,240
relaxed sense of privacy of a sense of

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,830
privacy regulation and so article also

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,350
said that quickly after these quotes

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:59,710
were said target hold all communications

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,420
and let them talk anymore and I would be

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,130
shocked if they still do this to this

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,080
day but this is what happens when you

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,540
build something really cool like hey we

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,880
can target pregnant women before they're

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,589
you know our registry this is a great

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,850
way to get you know your coupons and

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:18,400
people in the store but you're also

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:19,690
exposing people for being pregnant but

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,750
one of the good ways that this is being

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,800
uses in facebook if you or someone you

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,690
know starts posting and Facebook has an

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,790
algorithm to kind of detect a depression

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,200
slide and they can say okay this person

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,550
is starting to slide into the depression

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,310
so we're going to show them a message

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,380
that says hey we care somebody cares

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,270
here's a number to call go talk to

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,339
somebody and they actually have built

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,550
suicide prevention into Facebook

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:49,770
platform because they notice that their

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,770
platform can early detect some

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,460
they can it can and so that's again this

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,610
is the this is the dual sided mist of

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,930
the future right another feature that I

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,280
had some slides to work when I took my

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,080
office I was afraid we're going to go

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,790
through them too quickly was the

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,590
memories feature it's really awesome

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,180
every day I did a new memory to help

00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,950
that was three years ago I can't believe

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,740
that I see my kid from from two or three

00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,730
years ago they're a little baby but

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,470
there was something that posted out

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,110
there that says I'm sick and tired of

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:24,580
getting a memory every year of my son's

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,620
suicide remembering right I'm already

00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,140
going through it and Facebook is

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,850
reprioritizing me on it and again it's

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,010
one of these features that has the

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,150
duality of it so it has been build we

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,800
have to think to ourselves what are the

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,660
only intended consequences and copying

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,940
we prevent some of that unintended

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,350
consequences from occurring and you

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,980
start getting into this kind of Minority

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,980
Report

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,330
you know pre-crime we can tell things

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,430
are happening before they're happening

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,350
and we're seeing this actually with some

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,990
of the genetic testing that's going on

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,990
so how many folks have sent in the swabs

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,300
to see what your family history is and

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,470
stuff awesome you guys are actually part

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,050
of the drug travel if you don't know

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,940
you're part of and now all of your

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,830
relatives if they've ever committed a

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,110
crime that has DNA evidence but they

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,940
don't know who it is they recently in

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,940
California actually caught a serial

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,420
killer like thirty years after it

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:23,440
occurred because they were able to trace

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,930
the DNA to a family line of somebody who

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,940
wasn't prime suspect and I go huh that's

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,590
odd the DNA that we collected at the

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,080
scene matches the family line that we

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,030
saw at 23 feet let's go get a warrant

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,400
and then get that guy's DNA blown people

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,470
use the killer and so they're starting

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,800
to actually and they got the ranks to do

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,330
it they are selling your data to cancer

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,659
drugs

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:48,809
create genetically testing or

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:51,419
genetically targeted drugs for various

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,580
things again really cool you found all

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,190
this data on people from all over the

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,570
world you've got DNA from everyone and

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,419
you can make these medical breakthroughs

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,909
and science here that's really cool

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,370
being a blinder biologist DNA is really

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,440
fun this here's the hell out of me as a

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,600
technologist because I can't control

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,539
where my information is going and so you

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,860
run into the 8020 paradox and this gets

00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,510
applied before a bunch of different ways

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:24,360
right the the basic 8020 paradox is 20%

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:29,760
affects either 80% of the effects are

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:32,010
caused by 20% rather the you know of the

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,850
code or whatever but there's also the

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:38,610
80/20 rule and I'm guilty of this myself

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:40,679
you're building a system you say it's

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,090
maybe for the 80% let's make it work

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,590
there's no way it's ever going to be a

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,510
hundred percent I think we've all been

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:50,970
guilty of this right you get a bug in

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:53,760
your life but then the question comes

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,700
what happens to the 20% what happens to

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,519
the 1% that are being affected by this

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,190
and it may not be a bug it may be the

00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,610
memory of a suicidal or suicide in the

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:08,909
family or maybe the the record CD box

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,950
what happens to that 20% of that 1% and

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:16,200
are you creating a system that can cause

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:19,440
pain this is why accessibility is so

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,409
critical to everything we do because as

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,090
we build if we don't think about the 20%

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:29,250
or the 1% we're building in way for

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,990
people to no longer be able to use

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,220
technology no longer be able to use the

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,100
web and and we're isolating them

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,180
and it's sometimes these are already

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,070
minority populations they're already

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,790
disadvantaged you're pushing the partner

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,350
away and so technology kind of power to

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,880
change millions and millions of lives

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,320
and I think that's one of the fun things

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,450
about WordPress and if you're a core

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,880
contributory the plugins or anything

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,010
like this your code when you deliver it

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,810
it's going out to millions of people and

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,020
I had my first realization of this when

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,480
I was building a website that had a

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,640
broad reach to it we were getting 8 to

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,980
10 million hits per month and I had this

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:13,070
kind of Epiphany that long CSS aligned

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,380
CSS a bug here and eight million people

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:19,160
are gonna see it like that's a lot of

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,390
people and but at the same time I've

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,230
also been involved in some technology

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:26,270
were we're starting to send geo-located

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,460
SMS messages to people experiencing

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,930
homelessness to educate them about

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,910
services that are in their area that

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,440
they may not know about that's pretty

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,210
fun because now we need to use

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,450
technology to reach and impact the lives

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,970
of millions and so growing up in a tech

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,960
family we have a little bit of tough

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:47,300
love in our family all in good humor

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,620
though but my dad always ingredients and

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,340
ever since I was in canvas learning to

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,010
code

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,910
learning to code basic four or five

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,850
years old is that computers are only as

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,140
hard as the people who program so that

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,700
was his way of saying it's not the

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,560
computers fault it's yours

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,560
any times like ostomy computers like

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,730
and so because of that it's not

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,640
technology has the power to change

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,440
millions of lives we have the power to

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,440
change millions of lives and we need to

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,620
take that on and so the question is is

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,780
what are you doing to protect all of

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,240
your users what are you doing whether

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,280
it's a blog or whether you're building

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,560
massive experiences like the New York

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:35,060
Times what are you doing to protect and

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,860
to provide for all of your users and so

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,630
this is why privacy is a community

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,280
responsibility we need to build a

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,870
community around privacy we need to

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:47,900
build a community around accessibility

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:51,320
now sometimes we need a little nudge to

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,940
get ourselves there and unfortunately

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,460
for us in the u.s. we don't get those

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,770
not just fast enough it's a Europe

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,600
enacted a gbbr which we've all got to go

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,420
through this last spring it was a lot of

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,190
fun and we all now get to click on the

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,720
yes I want you to compete yes I know

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,880
cookies yes I'm here for these but a

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,540
really good source for GDP our privacy

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,250
in general other birds she's in Scotland

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,980
look her up on Twitter if she has great

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,120
great slides and presentations she's

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,890
been doing recently what you've been

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,750
talking about is the differences between

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,600
the European and American views of

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,990
privacy and it boils back to just

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,370
European American culture and I was

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,830
actually on this discussion today with

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,110
someone in they were talking about the

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,910
American view I hadn't even talked about

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,770
this and they almost went bullet point

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,190
for bullet point on this and the

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:45,740
inherent sense is that as Americans free

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,790
speech is a fundamental right everyone

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,250
gets the right to free speech

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,790
whether you're Alex Jones Westboro

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:56,230
Baptist Church or you know the New York

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:59,520
Times you can say whatever you want and

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,050
the data belongs to the owner and

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,330
the owner of the site or the owner of

00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,410
the application and it's an opt-out

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,360
culture right we're going to

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,130
automatically check the box for you oh

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,090
we didn't check uncheck the box sorry

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,410
but we're going to use it anyways and

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,740
then the other thing is we have an

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:20,280
inherent fear of government and inherent

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,890
trust in business right and it goes back

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,450
to our bootstrap mentality of everybody

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,730
can build a business anybody can be

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,900
successful so our businesses are what we

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,250
believe in if the government is just

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,200
trying to squash us and of course we sue

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,150
first ask questions later so everything

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,650
is just let's just sue and figure out

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,860
what the courts will say about it right

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,510
now in here it's almost one hundred

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,880
eighty percent opposite privacy is the

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,620
fun all right data belongs to the user

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,550
not to the application owner

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:53,550
it's an opt-in culture and people trust

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,190
the government and fear businesses and

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,110
now this isn't to say and in litigation

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,540
is a last resort so a lot of our

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,950
American views on GDP are we'll wait to

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,390
see who gets sued first and then we'll

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,130
make our decisions on how much we want

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,960
to comply with right because that's our

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,240
mentality and so this is is not saying

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,070
one is better than the other this is

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,420
just saying we need to know what our

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,610
differences are if we're never going to

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,280
talk about an even privacy or

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,500
accessibility or ethics we need to know

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,110
where we're coming from culturally now I

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,730
come from the Drupal community

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,320
originally and I got to see this in

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,179
WordPress and Drupal and how do we

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,450
handle some of these things right and so

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:37,290
WordPress you have privacy core Drupal

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:40,290
we don't we put it into contributing to

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,700
change that but it's not really

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,850
something that's happening in court

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,840
currently the gdpr module in Drupal has

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:50,370
2,300 installs there are millions of

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,790
websites in Europe that are running

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,040
Drupal and 2,300 of them are you see

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,410
that means that the rest of them are

00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,240
office kind of doing whatever they want

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,190
to do coating their own and hoping that

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,690
it's compliant and hoping that it's

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,610
saved and so because of this and

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,400
WordPress is very much the plug-and-play

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,370
you turn it on it works Drupal if you've

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,810
ever worked with Drupal I love it but

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,640
it's like I need this model and that

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,230
module and that module and this one's an

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,610
API for that one that one's going to

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,380
talk to this one at this one at this one

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,880
of them there's a UI they're going to

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,810
configure a few things for and then

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
you're good

00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,850
where is it WordPress you just turn it

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,580
on and it works and so knowing this it

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:34,460
isn't a WordPress or Drupal thing it's

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,740
how can we work together and adopt

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,570
common best practices across the open

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,910
web knowing our different communities

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,860
and knowing our different cultures how

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,560
can we build a sense of what is right

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,400
and how can we handle privacy on the

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,010
open web and when I talk about the open

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,680
web again I'm pointing you to the people

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:59,270
that are much smarter than I so go watch

00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,430
these these will just be like pour

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,480
yourself a coffee if you're having to

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,600
put a little bit of Bailey's in their

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,490
content be a deep right but but taking

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
what back and from whom this is great

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,930
going into the open web through the

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,740
origins of it what it really means to

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:18,470
have them open web and actually just

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,630
this week the world wide web foundation

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,060
actually just published in contract for

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:28,250
the web of core principles that they're

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:31,070
pushing to save be web entirely this is

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,300
what will happen and it says the web was

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,100
designed to bring people together and

00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,110
make knowledge really available everyone

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,910
has a role to play to ensure that the

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,200
web serves humanity by committing to the

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,150
following principles governance

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,580
companies and citizens around the world

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,230
can protect the open web as a public

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,630
good and a basic right for everyone so

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,510
it goes into this is as a government

00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,610
here's what you need to do as a company

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,100
here's what you need to do as a citizen

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,530
here's what you need to do now there's a

00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,940
lot of discussion of are these right

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,059
here these the right principles and all

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,570
that I look at it as this is a great

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:07,549
framework and yes it breaks it down and

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,900
some people say it should be everyone's

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,030
responsibility we should just put out a

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,040
credo if this is what it should be but

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,380
if you think about it government doesn't

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,270
act without people people are what power

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,919
business and business and 40 million

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,110
times is what powers the government and

00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,059
so we all have to have our own rules and

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,230
as long as we go back to the cultures

00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:26,540
and the communities and all the

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,820
different understanding of what we do we

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:33,260
can influence each other to create a

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,850
better web and so WordPress is actually

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,530
leading this right now because you guys

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:43,220
have a crime scene cor jubilant just got

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:45,440
that to set in kudos to them Drupal were

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,380
on our way there we're making it make it

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,549
happen and so what we're really saying

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,640
is we're actually going to be creating

00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:54,380
an open web privacy working group and

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,600
there's open web privacy working group

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,850
is going to be able to create a set of

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,799
standards that say this is what we're

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,450
going to hold our projects to as a

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,500
project we're going to commit ourselves

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:09,860
to certain basic fundamental principles

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,799
of privacy accessibility and what will

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,450
that what will that entail and then we

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,669
can each respectfully take those back to

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,330
our projects and work on whatever it is

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,940
in core that we do and the beauty of

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:25,540
and I was having discussing earlier

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,310
today about this with Silla and yes it

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,990
seems very altruistic we're going to go

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,220
out and conquer the open web and we're

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,770
going to be doing everything and when

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,370
you get into the trenches it starts to

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:41,770
suck but the problem is is that without

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:43,660
this we are reactive to the communities

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:46,570
around us rather than proactive

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,580
we're reactive to GDP our rather than

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,380
having a voice in - what do you got

00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,110
really does because there are parts of

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,270
the laws that just make no sense and

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,190
it's because you have other interests

00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,150
outside of our home that are able to

00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,650
voice them into it

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,210
and so what we're hoping to do with this

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,040
is not only state what we're going to be

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,650
doing is no good web but then also have

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,270
some advocacy into the decision making

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,580
of the policy making that goes on around

00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:14,290
us so that we can actually take part in

00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:18,220
these decisions but all this work needs

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:20,260
you because WordPress is a volunteer run

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,030
organization right we have a lot of

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,470
companies that are working in it but

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,600
even those companies volunteered time to

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,690
make the Corps happen people take their

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,150
own time to make or have it and so this

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,740
work needs your assistance so what can

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:38,200
you please get involved whether it's

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,440
writing a blog speaking out on Twitter

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,870
or get into the coding if that's what

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,790
you do become an advocate for privacy

00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,580
what you do become an advocate for

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:51,040
accessibility and start to think about

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,410
how you can make WordPress

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,480
impact the world event in a better way

00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:59,980
and so here's more privacy slack channel

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,710
all that good stuff

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,940
there's office hours there kind of early

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,490
in the morning for us here on the

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,910
Pacific Coast time but you can get

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:13,360
involved there accessibility as well in

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,740
slack and online get involved and

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,580
there's a lot of ways to get involved

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,749
here if you don't

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:22,299
be just you know that developer to get

00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:24,159
involved and so think about the impact

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,989
your code they took up the impact equal

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,460
plugins and the websites and the

00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:31,749
applications that you're building with

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:33,399
it and what it does and I'm going to get

00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:35,710
a lot of flack for this program the

00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,419
hardcore games yes Ra's al Ghul is a

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,519
supervillain but he actually had a

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,989
really good line it says if you become

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,059
more than man devote yourself to an

00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:45,580
ideal because then you can become

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:48,039
something else attack so the question is

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,739
let's devote ourselves to build a better

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,570
web for our future generations we have

00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:56,279
that responsibility because we have that

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:58,179
power my name's Chris title from Walker

00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,340
with that I'll take a couple of

00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:03,100
questions I've got maybe about 10

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:08,759
minutes or so yes we've got a microphone

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,759
here as well sorry

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,200
so one thing thank you first of all it's

00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:17,279
good talk

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:23,019
one thing that I think about in terms of

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:26,559
those of us who build the web is I

00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:30,899
believe that people build platforms and

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:35,580
products that reflect their values I

00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:35,580
personally don't believe that people

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,739
appropriate solutions for this diverse

00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:43,810
world we live in until the teams that

00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:48,110
build these things look like

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:52,820
you say something about that yes without

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,440
getting my foot to Colorado I agree if

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,720
you if you look at the communities that

00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,030
are building they don't look like the

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:08,440
world population unfortunately a lot of

00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:11,210
times elevation which but it's true and

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:17,420
also what it is is that if you're

00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:19,520
building a for-profit company when we

00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,340
build we're building for one thing to

00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,320
grow for profit we also have an

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,870
altruistic side of our company and that

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,730
our goal is to make encryption available

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,080
to everyone we want anybody to have

00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,970
access but yes it's a double-edged sword

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,330
but we believe that it's fundamental

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,630
right of the web to have that if your

00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:43,190
company's aim is to just build for

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:45,350
profit and not build for the world and

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:50,030
that large that I do think you run into

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:52,550
a lot of those issues I will give the

00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,890
larger companies credit for some of the

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,540
steps of the starting to take so I

00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,170
believe that it's a little too little

00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,160
too late

00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,600
yes but I believe that there is some

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,600
change starting to occur

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,960
I love the belief that that change is

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,280
going to have to be forced upon them so

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,970
I'm personally starting to get involved

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,710
in in the policy around privacy at the

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,230
federal level and trying to get involved

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,290
there so that we can have a voice for

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:25,760
our views of the web not just the

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:28,220
commercial consumer and again I really

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,240
recommend you go back and watch the

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:34,580
taking 1 taking back what from a mu

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,470
because it talks about that of the open

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,450
web I was originally fostered by a

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,880
facebook at Google and then all of a

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:44,630
sudden that started cannibalizing to not

00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,630
right so I hope that answers your

00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,700
question but I do think that we're

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,440
starting down that path I think we've

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,710
kind of opened Pandora's box a bit and

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,080
we're trying to cram everything back in

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,940
but I think it's possible I think that

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,530
that nothing else that we don't like

00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,240
global warming if we don't do anything

00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,860
now it's just going to get worse if we

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,630
don't do anything now about what we deal

00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,490
with the privacy issues that were

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,380
running it's going to day basis then

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,380
it's just going to be to be tours I

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:18,310
don't add this and privacy are pretty

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,310
heavy topics so

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,899
[Music]

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:11,760
we have to be proactive about it

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,630
diversity inclusion accessibility

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,440
doesn't come naturally apparently

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,870
especially doesn't come naturally for

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,030
groups of people because it has we start

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,830
the group we start to group with people

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,770
that are like us whether we like it or

00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:28,800
not and so we need to push diversity we

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,840
need to push and it's not just cultural

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,030
diversity its diversity and pain points

00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,320
right and bringing that into our

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,840
companies and bringing that into our

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,330
communities embracing it when somebody

00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,320
has a different view don't shoot it down

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,700
elevate it and bring it to light a good

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,510
example of that one of the first times I

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:52,200
met Heather we were in Belfast or work

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:54,560
in we're sitting down at a pub and me

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,120
being the double American and I have

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,650
opened my mouth and I was like so what

00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,600
do you think it brings it and it was

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,720
like the two days afterwards right we

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,690
got more his brain didn't realize how

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,060
sensitive the topic was as I'm as I'm in

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,740
Belfast which has a long history of

00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,260
issues

00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,390
so again me not being culturally aware

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,830
and her reply was awesome she's

00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,830
listening she goes how strong

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,479
I gave you though and so yeah so I think

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:29,609
it's it's sometimes we try like I was

00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:31,019
trying to spark a conversation and I

00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,900
just don't know how all the times and so

00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:35,609
I and definitely my foot my mouthing

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,979
dreaming ups or subjects but it's

00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:39,209
through that I think that we learned so

00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:39,660
I guess we're gonna make mistakes and

00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:41,880
yes

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,229
there aren't any issues if you look at

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,259
the community now if you're WordPress

00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:47,759
and Drupal the web at large we're having

00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:50,009
issues we're having issues these

00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:51,829
specific issues of people from

00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:54,959
underserved communities from

00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:57,959
accessibility needs trying to have their

00:37:54,959 --> 00:38:00,420
voices heard and so it's not something

00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:02,009
that is theoretical it's something that

00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,930
we're living through right now

00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:05,369
and so it's it's how do we get voice of

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,939
the voiceless how do we actually live

00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:18,059
out what are the open webs credo in our

00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:20,360
code in our communities did I say

00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,810
something bad

00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,980
