Publication date: 2020-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	As developers, we are capable of many amazing feats. We can create experiences that touch the lives of millions, brings aid to the corners of the world, empowers new businesses and bring a voice to the voiceless. WordPress powers over 30% of the entire web! However with this capability, we must also take on the responsibility for the people, and data, we interact with.
During this session, we’ll discuss how a culture of security can benefit not only your organization but also protect your end users and yes even the world. We’ll look at the ethics of privacy, secure web design and architecture, and the impact our decisions have on the community and our users. Mixed in will be best practices for secure coding, how to manage sensitive data from clients and users, compliance with various regulations and laws around privacy, and how to foster a culture of security even while you manage distributed teams. I’ll share my experiences from almost a decade in Open Source and some of the mistakes and successes I’ve had along the way.
Most of all, as WordPress continues to empower more and more of our digital world, it is up to us to decide as a community how we will use this influence and together we can work to make the world a better and safer place for people no matter where they come from.
