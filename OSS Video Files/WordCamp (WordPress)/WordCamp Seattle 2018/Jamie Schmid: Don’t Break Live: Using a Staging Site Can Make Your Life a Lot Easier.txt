Title: Jamie Schmid: Don’t Break Live: Using a Staging Site Can Make Your Life a Lot Easier
Publication date: 2020-04-08
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Have you ever updated your WordPress site or plugins, and suddenly found yourself looking at The White Screen of Death? What you thought was going to be a routine update has just brought down your entire website, and the panic sets in fast. If this is your live website, that can quickly translate to loss of revenue, customer trust, and a lot of time and money down the drain. Not to mention the very bad day you are about to have.
It’s so important to keep your WordPress site, plugins and themes updated due to the many security threats that are constantly being found and fixed – but what happens when one of these updates breaks your site? In this talk I will cover tips and strategies for keeping your site updated safely, what to do if it breaks, and how to avoid breaking your live site in the first place through use of a staging site that runs alongside your live website. Fortunately, there are many options for creating and managing a staging site, ranging from the most simple click-to-push, to more complex solutions integrated into a developers’ workflow. I will show you how to set up your very own staging server in a few different ways, so you can push that Update button without putting your live site in jeopardy.

oh don't break lives using a staging

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,430
staging side to make it easier a lot

00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:14,350
into Jamie Smith we've been apart a

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,109
particular passion for creating

00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,289
excellent content experienced citizen

00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:22,119
originally from no Augie Wisconsin he

00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,890
has been working as a WordPress

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,510
freelancer and consultant since 2012

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,140
very rapidly take the sites from

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:35,520
conception to a well managed build

00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,340
process that encourages communication

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,680
planning and smart use of content she

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,430
has if I got an information architecture

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,690
and content strategy and a big old

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,860
enthusiasm from all things workers now I

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,440
will get Portland Oregon Jamie is a

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,850
community evangelist for sidewalk

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,610
traveling the country and helping build

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:26,530
awareness or website security best

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:29,200
practices as bushes let's go to James of

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:33,549
all sizes so

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,509
business to working in enterprise and in

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:40,960
the time I have seen sites get half I've

00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:45,549
seen sites go down I have cause dates to

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,270
go down and I've worked in a lot of

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:52,270
different development environment so I

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,340
pretty much learned as many of us

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,380
eventually do that have an intermediary

00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:02,440
site in between you and life is a good

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,080
idea so that you can and that's what

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,520
this talk is about

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,489
so first few people you know that you

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,970
need to get your site updated but making

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,350
updates and changes is dangerous anybody

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,569
has ever made there is enough data

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,989
online and prospects to take what

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:24,220
arguments it's a very bad moment for you

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:27,040
or your client so but you need to keep

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,530
them updated so updating on a staging

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,290
thing is really the ideal way to do it

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,540
and especially with 5.0 coming down the

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,010
pipe soon or relatively soon we're going

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,329
to be doing a lot of updates for clients

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,010
we're gonna be updating a lot of our new

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,050
sites so knowing how to do something

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,230
like this

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,700
come in really handy very soon so first

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,220
of all there's kind of two different

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,110
directions you can sort of take one

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,150
answer like the user implementer and one

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,330
is like a developers I just want to kind

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,550
of ask who in here considers themselves

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,190
either a user were somebody built your

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,590
spec for you or an implementer which

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:09,600
would be maybe you build sites brothers

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:12,780
we don't necessarily do very much okay

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,330
and who is more of a developer building

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:21,710
sexually okay actually that's pretty

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:23,910
much even so I'm gonna be doing both but

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,930
so for the development side of things

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,330
that's a very sort of personal opinion

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,030
and decision they have and development

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,500
so I can go into every single option but

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,390
I'm going to go through it and hopefully

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,840
get some things that you think you might

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,900
be non-static safe so first what is the

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,740
staging site and some kind of copy of

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,370
your site that you can test updates you

00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,410
can do development on you can do things

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,450
like install new plugins and themes and

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,030
all kind of things in your own private

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,860
environment where the public doesn't see

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,959
it so you have to worry about in case

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,709
you do break something it's not going to

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,290
affect your lifestyle so when I say

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,680
staging or when I say how maybe like

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,329
a development site or anything like that

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm talking about the site nobody sees

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,199
and when I say life or production that

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,810
means your site that's on the internet

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,579
that your clients are going to and using

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,650
every day don't know that usually don't

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:28,139
work right so how does that work there

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,350
is pretty much three things that it

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,660
really has to do make an exact duplicate

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,340
of your life site and that's because you

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,840
want to make sure that you can predict

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,030
any sort of issues those going to happen

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,979
with your life site you don't want to

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,090
have different WordPress versions you

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,280
don't necessarily want to different

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,110
content to proponents and the themes you

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,050
want to be as close to the website as

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,940
possible and then you make your changes

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,639
maybe make update its features whatever

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,479
and then when those changes are all good

00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,949
you push it up to the live site knowing

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:04,919
that is probably not going to break so

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:07,770
those are just three very basic simple

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,360
sounding steps but it's not necessarily

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,830
easy and I know that this talk is how

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,860
even if statements that can make your

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,180
life a lot easier and that's true but it

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,130
does take a little bit of a time

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,099
investment up front to get that whole

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,960
workflow set up so there's a couple

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,270
reasons that it's not that you need and

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,289
understanding these reasons is going to

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,599
help you

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,330
decisions and what your solution is

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:32,369
going to be that you know that you're

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,909
going to try out it and to pick the one

00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:38,099
that's right so when you do changes in

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,800
WordPress WordPress has physical files

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,680
like indexed out page and then they also

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,270
have database files and that would be

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,719
sitting in your my sequel database on

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,659
your server but when you make changes

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,550
the changes can include both physical

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,889
files and database changes at the same

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,020
time sometimes it can be just files

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:05,999
sometimes it can be just database

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:08,209
changes so damn pieces are hard to think

00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:12,659
that's a very important thing to know

00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:14,909
for lots of different reasons WordPress

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:18,180
has some specific reasons why it's

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:20,990
difficult and WordPress using static

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,939
URLs and it states that means when you

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,490
start the new site it literally will say

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,509
wo you don't got my site calm in your

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,599
database so if you take that exact

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:36,089
database and plop it into another

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,399
another location like maybe staging my

00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,529
site calm those URLs aren't going to

00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,029
work you need to go through and changing

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,909
those here L so that being actually in

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,039
your location and it's not even that

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:49,199
simple either because WordPress also

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,169
uses serialized data which means

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,490
basically encoding at some of the

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,030
database and

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,340
way that you will also need to update

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,430
those in the house anymore in both

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,639
classes and then also different

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,050
environments the development or the

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,849
speaking of drachma cruising and not

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,410
necessarily exactly the same as your

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:16,560
life site maybe you're using a local

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,139
development kind of solution that's not

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,270
necessarily going to be the exact

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,630
development and this server setup that

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:28,620
maybe you haven't here GoDaddy or WP

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,509
engine whatever anything so those are

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,810
some of the main things that make this a

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,130
little bit of difficult solution to put

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,560
into place that you have to figure out

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:43,220
your own answers to those issues as you

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,930
go so understanding what is required

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,970
getting down to the real basics of what

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,990
you need in order to accomplish this you

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,610
need to have a replica of your live site

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,099
you need to put it someplace that it can

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,039
run as a website request into the

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:01,909
database it uses

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:04,440
my sequel it uses lots of different

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,380
software that you need to basically a

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,310
server to run and then you need some how

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,039
to get those changes to your life site

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,570
so if those say things in mind I'm going

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,460
to talk about setting up a staging site

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,420
for users and implementers and so I

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,990
introduce this in a way

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,610
you are just the user and we said just

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,120
the user but you have limited

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,330
development knowledge or an implementer

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,590
I want to present these in a way that

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:40,200
someone doesn't necessarily need to know

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:42,660
point in order to okay so the first

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,540
thing is this isn't really necessarily a

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,440
step to creating a data Manor to video

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,880
staging site but it's very important so

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,830
you need to audit your site you probably

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,800
should audit your site regardless and if

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,050
you've recently done it or you're very

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,880
intimately familiar with everything

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,370
that's on your site if you're very

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,370
familiar with your hosting and what kind

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,710
of access your hosting gives you to the

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:12,390
to the various things that they're using

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:16,130
to run your site what what what service

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,130
levels you have to do you have a

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,270
subscription that is going to give you

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,590
access to creating a staging site is it

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,910
going to give you access to creating

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,440
arrows from doing or is your company may

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,900
be limiting your access to doing these

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,720
things thinking about how busy your site

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,730
is because we're gonna see we're doing

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,730
is really taking a copy of our life site

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,230
and putting it somewhere else so

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,330
depending on how long it's sitting this

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,520
somewhere else we might have life things

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,899
happening at their site people could be

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,179
any comments they could be making

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:53,699
commerce site they could be just adding

00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,649
you know user-contributed content so all

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:57,509
those things could be happening you know

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,509
well you're still on your staging site

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:03,269
with a copy that's not someone updated

00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:06,389
so you have to think about that when you

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,879
think my interest has changed up are

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,129
using version control you don't know

00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,699
what that is is your developer using

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:17,489
version control because if they are

00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:21,480
there they might have a process already

00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:23,309
in place and that'll also sort of give

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,059
you something that's not what you're

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:30,660
thinking about a development workflow or

00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,910
just to work for doing that the size of

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,689
your site if you're creating a stadium

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:39,389
site on your existing posting minimally

00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:41,819
you'll have to have enough space to host

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:44,730
two versions of that website to live in

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:46,410
staging some staging solutions actually

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,079
required that you have enough space to

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,540
host three because they sort of set up a

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,999
temporary website well they're moving

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,949
them across so make sure you know like

00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:59,549
hoping your site isn't and how big your

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:01,079
hosting space actually is another

00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,779
important one is are there any

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:08,429
automations on your site so for example

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,859
there are some plugins or services that

00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,720
do auto emailing where they will send

00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:15,089
out some automated messages to your

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,519
users and that will include video link

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,559
back to your site so if that comes out

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,509
on your staging site it will

00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,369
automatically come your staging URL you

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:27,239
don't want to send that upstairs fine so

00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:28,559
like what's all going on your site what

00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:30,809
do you have access to what your

00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,350
environment is is really important for

00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:37,139
setting to see anything so let's look at

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,519
what are your actions the first one is

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:43,829
one I really like for clients where I do

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,509
a lot of volunteer work and I don't

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,249
necessarily have time to do a lot of

00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,600
support for them and I want to put

00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,639
something in place where they will be

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,069
able to take it and and update it

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,499
themselves with minimal and work for me

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:59,009
so a lot of postings offer something

00:11:55,499 --> 00:12:00,629
called welcome staging and this is going

00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,569
to be in your cPanel or it's going to be

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:05,339
someplace in your hosting account or

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:08,429
your dashboard that's going to allow you

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,289
to click a button to create your staging

00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:12,989
site and it's going to duplicate life

00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:15,749
automatically build that some domain or

00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:19,829
whatever the new URL is and then give

00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:21,689
you a separate access it's easy and fast

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,989
but it's also more expensive because

00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:27,989
host that included sort an integrated

00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:29,939
solution that takes a lot of support and

00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:30,839
it takes a lot of constant work so

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,799
they're gonna be a little bit more

00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,799
expensive but you can see there this is

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,220
WP engine when you're literally logged

00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:44,279
into the WordPress and then you see a

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,289
section in there called staging and you

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,269
see that the button that says copying

00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:50,489
sites from life to statement like that's

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,289
super simple you push that one and then

00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,569
you see the right button which is a

00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:57,359
deploy site from staging to life and

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:59,850
it's read because they want you to think

00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,250
about the things that that I sort of

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,680
know or when you're doing

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,930
like making sure you know what you're

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,750
overriding making sure everything is

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:12,740
definitely working right before you go

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,390
ahead and push that weapon there's a

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,090
good amount of hosts that offer

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:21,170
one-click saving this is not a

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:23,900
comprehensive list but depending on what

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,890
host is look into it see if they are a

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,350
lot of them do if your client or you do

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,870
not have posting I mean consider one of

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:39,170
these because it's it's an easiest

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:42,800
solution into the fastest solution find

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,450
that maybe you only have maybe you don't

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,540
have the level of access to be able to

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:53,000
create there's also staging plug-in

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,800
continuity staging things of use don't

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,190
even see anyone saw it right into your

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,500
website and what it does is our ethnic

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,210
spins up a new WordPress install that's

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,140
sort of sitting inside your life site

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:09,589
but it's completely separate its freedom

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,230
plugins right well I believe it does

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,260
have a premium version that gives you a

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,210
lot more options and then it also

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,220
migrates the changes to your life site

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,930
so sort of like the doink engine works

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:26,589
pushing the red button this one will you

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,000
push your changes over and it can do and

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,950
content reaching home I think the free

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,830
version will just push content changes

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,600
for you the pro version can allow you to

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,640
do a full migrates to your site so that

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,970
would be if you're doing a wordpress

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,010
update and you're updating a lot of

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,960
things in WordPress core that you don't

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,600
necessarily have the ability to

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,230
cherry-pick and push them over maybe new

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,240
home ownership and then standalone sites

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,089
so this would be something that sits in

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,010
a subdomain or subfolder the difference

00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,540
between this and the of the plug-in is

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,080
that this is manual so you're going to

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:08,330
go ahead and create a subdomain on your

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:11,209
posting manually go search and you know

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,390
set up here in DNS and all that kind I

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,950
need to firewall that so you're going to

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,950
be creating that subdomain and then

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,870
you're going to duplicate your life set

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,790
yourself and you're going to put it up

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,610
onto that subdomain and then you're

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,930
going to use another solution to take

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:32,370
your changes and my

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,610
pushed onto your lap safe so this one is

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:39,600
a bit more hands-on but it's a good

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,760
solution for people that are we have a

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,820
more limited budget or they want to have

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,440
more direct control over exactly what

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,860
their will be exactly how they're moving

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,110
it so this involves we may have couple

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,790
plugins one plug-in that's going to

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,550
package up their live site into an

00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,780
archive so that it can take that archive

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,990
and and basically republish it onto your

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,430
staging site so that's one and the

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,560
reason that we need that plug-in is

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,800
among other things because of that URL

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,490
issue so make your changes that part is

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,790
pretty simple

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,470
and then so we have the issue of how do

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:20,490
you get those changes back into your

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,290
live site one of the more manual ways to

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,970
do it probably the most manual way to do

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,340
it is to literally just go to your live

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,800
site and make those changes again so

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,600
this would be maybe you are doing an

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,390
update of your theme and if you're like

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,130
sometimes when I update the theme

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,220
so I'm going to just push the update

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,900
button on CJ and then everything's good

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,370
nothing broke that's awesome I'm just

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,090
gonna log into my life side and push the

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,320
Update button there so that one is as

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,450
easy as pretty can be more

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
time-consuming but there are some

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:56,070
plugins that allow you to basically push

00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:03,630
your sites or parts of your site to the

00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:04,949
live server and then so I'm just going

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,300
to go through some of the plug-in

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:07,560
solutions and just some of the general

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,079
solutions for this

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,290
so for duplicating your site so this is

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,670
one of the many things that you have to

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,400
think about if you are going to be

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,839
moving it yourself so basically it will

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,680
involve trees you create an archive of

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,949
your site

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,810
this will include database 1 and then

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,880
all the files that are necessary to

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,590
completely rebuild that so you know

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,520
where press is using database you need

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,860
to package up that database and include

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,480
it with your site files and then have

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,320
another plug-in on the other site that's

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:45,260
going to open up that that zip file and

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,260
create your database run all your files

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,930
so

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:58,330
I think ask some examples at the NSS so

00:17:52,930 --> 00:18:00,310
the migrate your site that is reinstall

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,950
your site on to another server so when

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:05,820
we're talking about duplicating this is

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:09,010
actually sometimes called archiving so

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,840
if yours you know you're creating it

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,030
without a solution in place that's maybe

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,950
creating archive check and see if it

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,250
stays in the database and also check and

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,050
see if it's saving your full full site

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,450
I'm not going to talk about backups in

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,160
this talk but you should be backing up

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,230
your site very early and you should be

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,680
also testing those backups to make sure

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,380
that you can reinstate them if you do

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,000
have a full backup included database

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,480
including everything you need you can

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,990
use that backup to you know to rebuild

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,580
it on your staining state so the

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,410
migrating that's actually pushing it to

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,450
the new place reinstall an another

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:50,290
server making sure the database works

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,510
make sure the browser all did so

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:56,470
serialize data that you need to find

00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:00,250
anyplace there in the config dot PHP

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,130
file don't even think of HP and that

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,170
thing that has stuff like the database

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,050
location the database password the

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,760
database user those are going to change

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,680
with your new staging site because

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,750
you're going to have a different

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,640
database essentially so those thing

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,020
about the up the engine robots access

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,770
key

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,720
if you need a developer using

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,610
removing those developer tools change

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,760
into air reporting that you know you've

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,050
been made using the troubleshoot any

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,820
kind of notifications that you don't

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,290
want on your public facing site if

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:38,900
that's their version and then a caching

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,970
security email automation you don't

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,650
necessarily want to have cash enabled on

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,050
your staging site because sometimes

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:48,260
caching won't show you exactly what's

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,880
going on so this day when the caching

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,500
remember what I can say with the

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,860
thrashing and creative and able in the

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,910
cache and when you push back to five so

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,280
I've been saying

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,660
there's also another word coverage

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,330
there's a difference between those two

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,820
and that difference though is important

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,980
when you are thinking about how you'd

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,680
like to overwrite to your website so

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,290
same thing is basically when you're

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,850
overwriting your live site with your

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,160
staging you're creating statements that

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,570
you've made all the updates you're

00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,010
pretty sure nothing has changed on

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,810
linesman to do with it

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,510
so you're free to go ahead and overwrite

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:29,060
the entire install basically with your

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:32,860
staging install that's all okay so

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:37,400
that's all pretty everything merging is

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,200
a situation where it can be really

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,600
useful if some things have changed on

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,179
your live site like

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,130
like order and you've made changes that

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:49,419
don't affect those orders and you just

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:53,919
want to push those changes so this is

00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:56,590
difficult because of you can't really

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,289
emerge of database easily so there are

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,080
some solutions where you can merge parts

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,179
of it where you can where to sign up

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,690
with I don't even want to use that word

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:10,539
to those but it's very complex there are

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:19,809
some solutions that are sort of doing it

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:21,850
well pretty well it's sort of it's sort

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,529
of an ongoing banking facts even

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,470
developers are looking for a really good

00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,789
solution to when you have a development

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,500
environment where maybe you have three

00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,690
different people working on the site and

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,120
maybe they're all making their updates

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,639
to a database you would like to ideally

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,639
have all of their updates go into the

00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:41,500
new database and all not compete with

00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:48,029
each other and also into exact favorite

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:51,340
places it's not that easy to go so I

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:53,019
have some tools here that you can use a

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,330
lot of them are plugins so there's

00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,100
duplicator it allows you to just create

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,970
an archive of your site right from your

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,400
WordPress dashboard it has a phantom

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,640
paint version the free version

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,770
if you have a not so big sight it can

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,510
pretty much do everything it if you have

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,930
a very big sight you probably want to go

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:16,140
at the paid version and it basically are

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,020
Kaizen and a little bit different way

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,420
back up buddy it's a it doesn't backups

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,150
in Stata make backups with it's a good

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,800
backup solution but it's also a good way

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:32,970
to create your archives you want to go

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:36,730
with the staging only one WP migration

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,230
this is for more larger sites I don't

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,150
believe that there's a free version of

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,000
this I think that it's only at home

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,559
there's a free version news yes started

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,450
but the V version has obviously more

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,150
options in it it also has any key scale

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:57,370
integration so if you're a developer

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:59,230
you're able to access that same thing

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,059
and backups you're saying it's a problem

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,559
you can do don't you see like a lot of

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,690
these do is sort of the same things

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,550
there are different price point they

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,250
some of them do slightly different

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,050
things so really just looking there you

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,950
know I'm trying my looking at the one

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,950
that works best for you

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,260
and then we have my great TV which does

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,210
the database migrations and this is

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,070
something where it allows you to do more

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,950
complex

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,420
migration so only a few things changing

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,790
their data nation you only want to push

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,630
those few things this plugin can help

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:37,540
you do that and there's no uplay facing

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,000
so the only thing same thing is plugging

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,320
it doesn't a free version the free

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,510
version pretty much only syncs up

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,760
content but the paid version it's $30 a

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,270
year but it allows you to do a very

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,310
granular sort of picking and choosing

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,040
what kind of things you want to push to

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:11,800
your website and they've got support for

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:13,480
a lot of different plugins so this is

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,820
just don't even say it gets a quick demo

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:20,530
that they have on how it works so that

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,050
the staging sides on the right and they

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,420
are moving some changes from the website

00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,470
to the staging site so happening pretty

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,770
quickly but if we see there's two

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:34,240
buttons there that say pull in and then

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:36,160
there's another one that so that it was

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,880
really quick but basically what you kind

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,440
of saw was that it's all the changes and

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,180
then when you're refreshed you could see

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,300
those extra pieces of content on the

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,390
staining site so that's pretty cool and

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,580
another solution which is really it's

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,299
sort of a development solution what you

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,509
can also

00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:57,219
if your orbit implementer is having a

00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:58,690
local work test install there's a couple

00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:01,719
solutions that are out there right now

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,159
that will set up a custom local

00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:06,129
development environment that's

00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,839
specifically for WordPress desktop

00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,219
server every with a very first one to

00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,989
offer something like this and they've

00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:13,749
been around the longest

00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:15,099
these are through your installing

00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:18,580
software right here computer that allows

00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:21,070
it to run as a server so that you can

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,409
run your WordPress site right on your

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:27,070
computer as if it was a server like you

00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:29,289
know you're your host doesn't is not the

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:32,019
only one there is a local my client has

00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:35,619
one I really need to have a silo host

00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:38,049
excuse it you don't know okay

00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,599
so local my flywheel is also an option

00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:43,719
regardless of here goes when do you

00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:45,309
think some other solution that I've

00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:48,339
heard are in the works for various

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,829
hosting companies so this is a situation

00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,450
where you can make those changes on your

00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,999
you know your laptop or your computer

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,339
and we like okay Google if it actually

00:25:54,999 --> 00:26:00,099
works so I've imported my live site into

00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:02,499
this development a local moment and the

00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:05,529
thing works so now I can go ahead and do

00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:07,089
it on my last night one of the nice

00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,900
thing that desktop server does my

00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:12,590
believe

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:15,290
it also is a direct employ it basically

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,170
connects to your life sight beyond

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:20,360
plugin and it can overwrite your entire

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,340
life site with your staging sites if you

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,770
made those changes you could push it

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,810
straight out there or if you have the

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,050
subdomain solution where you come to our

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:32,270
staging site is in a subtly maybe you

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,680
can push this to the subdomain so now

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,310
they're coming on the same host a the

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,280
same environment and you can better you

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,870
know evaluate if this is going to cause

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,200
any issues now that your any of your

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:50,210
server environment and then you can also

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,040
push it to life it's not a solution that

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:56,060
I would have put in place for just any

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,400
of my clients because there's a little

00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,880
bit confusing but honestly like desktop

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,370
server is really super easy to use

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,200
and if you're looking into maybe local

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,600
WordPress development they have a free

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,280
version you can just install it and get

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,050
it up and running pretty easily you can

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,900
spare on with it so what is local side

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,520
2010 your uncle here I'm using software

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:25,820
that allows your computer to run as a

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:27,260
server okay so all those different

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,820
solutions there's a lot of different

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:33,080
parts to it and I gave different

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,940
solutions for each one every one of

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,480
those solutions kind of depends on where

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,059
Charles

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,380
sites for clients maybe they have

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,970
different posting maybe they have

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,190
different budgets maybe they haven't for

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,159
me that's the fun of hands-on that's a

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,559
fun thing an agency we can't always

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,490
necessarily pick what your clients heart

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,789
is so one week of scheduled for doing

00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:00,159
updates it's really going to be very

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:02,020
useful for you if you at least commit to

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,500
once a month going in look at your site

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:09,789
making the updates and then pushing them

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,549
to your website using a service you can

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,799
attract their updates there are service

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,990
out there that allow you to basically

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,090
monitor all the sites that you have and

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:22,090
it'll tell you what you haven't plug-in

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,429
that need updating when it there's a new

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,090
WordPress version out and only these two

00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:31,450
sites are updated to it and this juror

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:34,419
may call your patron staging first and

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,720
then never break life so that is

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:42,520
basically the solution that is good for

00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:48,090
users and different implementers so now

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:50,740
oh sorry so so evaluating your options I

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,299
kind of won over this when we were

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,890
talking about beginning but how much

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,289
kind of resources you have for

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,290
maintenance if you were need to see that

00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:02,290
it's going to be starting up a meeting

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,150
and having done it before thinking about

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,490
how much you actually have to do this

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,500
mean this is going to help you inform

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,740
you of what solution you're using for

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,320
this your budget how often you're going

00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,710
to be checking for our kids how often

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,030
you're going to perform yo case and

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,950
performing the updates knowing what

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,590
these things is gonna make a lot easier

00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,710
human a process in place having a

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:29,710
process in place is really the best way

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,660
to minimize the amount of time you spend

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:36,910
doing these things and to automate what

00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:41,110
you can send us more things how many

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:46,180
sites people that our government like

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:48,100
coming people are the changes okay so

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,010
we're gonna get just so quick basic

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:55,420
workflows here I don't know what I have

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:58,120
one time okay but we're good so I'm just

00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,320
gonna kind of go over some examples we

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,570
don't have to really go for all these

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,350
but I do have this the sides are gonna

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:08,730
be up and I believe that our camp has

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,690
these slides up available to die da

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,180
confirmed these your rules

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,490
tell your user number update live we

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,660
have a stadium site to that update

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,730
schedule you know move stated live to

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,820
staging make your changes or station to

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:28,930
life you're going to do the duplication

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,930
[Music]

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:37,800
changes some domain duplicated using you

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,780
know whatever you want make

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:45,540
changes and then pushing that with

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:48,600
anyone and then look at where you can

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:55,920
push it to stage me or live or you can

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:57,600
make the changes and on stage so the

00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,980
developer and developer workflows

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,380
this is I'm not to get very deeply into

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,590
this because developer workflows are

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,720
very personal thing and they're they're

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,770
the decisions you make are very much

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,960
relying time what your entire developer

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,730
workflow is so I can't tell you an exact

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,920
staging solution because it really

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,260
depends on how you're developing your

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,620
site there's a lot of factors involved

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,770
here and the things I will be talking

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,600
about is not anywhere near exhaustive I

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,340
don't even know about all the options

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,290
that are out there if you talk to the

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,820
developer any developer here

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,340
they're probably going to tell you a

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,500
very different development workflow

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,740
every single one unless being they work

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,290
for some company everybody does kind of

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,730
something different and that's because

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,800
everybody works a little bit differently

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,500
everybody has different requirements and

00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,470
different limitations and do preferences

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,680
on how I like to work so not expensive

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,990
but I am going to go over the things

00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:05,190
that you need to think about when you

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,850
are making a plan or how your workflow

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,910
is going to go

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,610
and because stage

00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,440
really part of your development workflow

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:15,250
this is not an above the work they've

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,890
taught I've only got a kind of glance

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:19,960
over those things okay

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,630
main things to consider so they're

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,300
they're pretty much the same as what the

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:28,270
users only out using some fancier dead

00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,550
words provisioning the staging site to

00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,370
match production basically this just

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,800
means you have a way to look at all of

00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,840
your server settings all of your maybe

00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,480
your WordPress settings every all your

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,840
configurations you have a way to package

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,060
that up and push it on to your maybe

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,010
your stay a new site so instead of

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,990
manually going through me like do I have

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,740
in the same thing HP version two out how

00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:55,480
all of these permissions the same you

00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,830
can actually push that up and a lot of

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,540
them do it so that's where we say

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:02,580
provisioning that's pretty much what we

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:06,150
need another thing to keep it in mind

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,150
sharing Tizen

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,770
things like keys its Nikes anything like

00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,750
that that's something that you don't

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,980
necessarily want everyone to have access

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,990
to but if you do have a lot of

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,730
developers they do need to have access

00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,750
to them so thinking about that and

00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:29,310
thinking about the configuration

00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:32,570
settings that you have it's also really

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:35,430
something that you need to or invalidate

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,320
the time and finds a gap between stadium

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,480
production again that's just what's all

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,460
happening on staging during the time

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,050
that I've been what's all have analyzed

00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:49,460
during the time that I've been singing

00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:52,460
and then deploying your changes okay

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,820
provisioning stagings master collection

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:59,610
there's lots of different ways and

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,920
solutions to do this a lot of the

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,270
solutions require that you have it

00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,550
integrated into your development

00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,930
workflow when I'm just going to order a

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:10,820
couple so blueprints are

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:13,530
one solution and this is where you can

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,300
create an ideal environment that you're

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,840
going to be using and reusing over and

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,570
over again

00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,760
and basically grabbing that thing and

00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,520
using it every time you start developing

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,590
a new site so that means there's a lot

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,480
of benefits to that and one of which is

00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,090
you have now you have predictable

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,940
workflow so you can work on making that

00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:40,920
more efficient you can have more people

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:42,660
contributing to it because you hosting

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,880
and companies like Pantheon

00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,500
when I say like Pantheon honestly

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,240
there's not too many that offered the

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,760
sort of integrated development that

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,330
Pantheon offers Pantheon has something

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,270
called a custom upstream which is their

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,160
sort of service that you have access to

00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,750
when you host with them that allows you

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,760
to basically create the start of

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,530
blueprint you can pull that blueprint

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,620
down so why when you're putting in the

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,660
site you can you can push it back up so

00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,550
that's really useful if there is your

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,660
campaign

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:20,690
WP SIOC is a command-line interface and

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:24,830
welcome that you can use for WordPress

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:27,810
it allows you from the command line to

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:30,750
you know create maybe download a

00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:33,690
blueprint of your site that has sewn so

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,820
plugins configured has also settings and

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,490
flags and all those kind of things so

00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,120
though yeah I don't realize on the

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:46,610
development tool also but it can be used

00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:50,720
for doing some sort of envisioning W

00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:53,940
that is a more advanced developer tool

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,110
I'm curious to know there's a bunch of

00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,130
developers in here does anyone

00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:03,980
share what they're totally fine if you

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:07,610
don't know there's a lot that goes into

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,500
it so knowing the word provision kuvira

00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,420
if you're everything developer is gonna

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,040
get you you know pretty far with google

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:17,450
talk to be able to figure out what you

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,580
want to use so the sharing even conveyed

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,220
across the environments and developers

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,780
like i was saying he's not necessarily

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,760
something you want to meet you

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:31,670
for example saving into your immersion

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:36,620
control the I might wear so many things

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:39,200
just forget it and convey WordPress has

00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,410
a lot of different configurations in it

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,170
and them the configurations that are in

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,640
wp-config.php are very minimal compared

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,310
to the amount of configurations that are

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,070
saved in the database and the way that

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:57,710
WordPress seems a lot of its

00:36:52,070 --> 00:37:01,790
configuration is in the table dokie

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:03,650
option and it's not super easy to be

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,049
able to just go through and pick and

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,489
know all the database

00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:12,139
that are only related to configuration

00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:14,019
rather than the demo caption scale so

00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:17,979
that's something to think about that is

00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:20,989
you know you want to the first solution

00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:23,359
things like ezf custom fields those are

00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,399
same from the database you can also

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,769
export it in a way so that it's saved as

00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:32,029
a file to things like sending emails

00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:36,799
caching like all those kinds of things

00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:37,369
you can turn that on or off FM is the

00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:40,339
solution

00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:44,449
Walker dot IO the guys lapataia Iowa's

00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:46,009
here gave a talk earlier and the

00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:48,950
solution that this company offer is

00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:50,739
actually pretty cool they do plow

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,939
[Music]

00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,549
basically your hosting and incursion

00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:57,859
tier teams so that anybody can access

00:37:55,549 --> 00:38:00,829
that without actually having to see what

00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:03,919
the key it is itself if you're using

00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,239
ansible or something like maybe trellis

00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:07,939
if you're using jaws for your

00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:11,719
development workflow and sablevulpe has

00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:15,889
a way of storing that and another way

00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:18,679
that various opinions on how how well

00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:20,269
this works storing the W config in the

00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,900
directory of of your site root it's

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:25,830
debatable whether this is

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,750
a great security solution or not but it

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:33,210
could be a way for you not to include

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:37,020
that maybe in your conversion control so

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,970
it's finding content gaps this is we're

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,160
talking about sinking and sinking

00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,930
databases and what you have developers

00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,470
they're all working on their own version

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:48,270
of the database all the databases have

00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:53,090
different things on them now including

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:55,560
maybe content maybe the optional scandal

00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,440
it's really hard to know what everybody

00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,860
is going to be contributing to that

00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,140
database

00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,870
like I said merging not super easy doing

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:11,520
something like continuous deployment

00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:13,440
whole nother talk minimizes what is all

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,320
going to be happening on your live sites

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,090
while you're doing staging so continuous

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,170
deployment is basically working on very

00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:24,960
small pieces of your project engineering

00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:27,570
small features and pushing them up on a

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,460
regular basis so now instead of having

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,560
this entire so we have products you're

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,410
mainly trying to get out maybe you've

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,880
pushed one at a time because it only you

00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,500
know it didn't take it only took a

00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,850
couple days to develop it or you know

00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,150
whatever synching your files is

00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:47,610
something you need to think about when

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,350
when someone uploads image to the word

00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,770
to WordPress

00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,390
it not only saves that actual image in

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,890
the dough

00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,170
and holder but it also creates a

00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,620
database entity for that image so you

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:03,290
can't just grab all of your images and

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,940
STP them up into your doughy content

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,800
because we're presently going to know

00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,510
that they're there because you didn't

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,150
upload it through WordPress WordPress

00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:16,220
didn't assign an ID to it it doesn't

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:19,070
know it's there and one of the emerging

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:22,490
issues with that is because it's

00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:24,320
assigning an ID to it if you have three

00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,180
different databases uploading three

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,770
different files they're going to have to

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,930
try these for their files they might

00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:32,960
have two files been I would say might be

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:37,630
you know what I was going to win out so

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:41,030
that's sort of an issue Lando is a new

00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,910
tool that is being used and a lot of

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:46,160
people really love it I know that pimp

00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:48,320
in integrates pretty well with it this

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,540
is not Pantheon I don't know nothing

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,970
paid to say this but if you're doing

00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:58,760
more advanced development worth looking

00:40:52,970 --> 00:41:01,610
into and then for deployment basically

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:06,200
how are you getting your changes took

00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:08,120
they're minimally you kind of deploy

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,180
straight from original usually you can

00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,160
give a bit account if you are

00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,400
just one developer you mean you don't

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,930
have a huge complex workflow the pocket

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,130
is next because it allows you do for

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:23,900
private repos for free you can deploy

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,600
your changes straight to life from that

00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,000
bucket so now we can sort of talk about

00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,100
a parish in digital talk but if you

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,140
wanted to create another branch for

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,240
staging right and you make

00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,039
change them staging then you merge them

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,829
once they're ready you merge them into

00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,539
maybe your productions and now if we can

00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,279
take those those new updates through

00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:48,650
production and push them up to your

00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:51,529
website so hopes to offer animates

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:54,049
integrated development environment a lot

00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:57,910
of hosts offer a git integration right

00:41:54,049 --> 00:42:02,829
into the hosting not all of course but

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:05,390
take a look it's good to have a hosting

00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:06,680
company that will allow you to have good

00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:11,329
integration so you can do those

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,069
questions really lots of lots of

00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:16,880
deployment tools out there again if

00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:23,240
anybody is anything wants to talk about

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:25,670
what they're using when you are a

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,589
developer for a long time and you find a

00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,869
workflow that works for you you get very

00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:32,869
enthusiastic about it and you want to

00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:34,819
share with the world so if you just

00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:36,920
google development workflow with

00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:39,200
WordPress there are a bunch of people

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,849
out there that I've published all their

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,820
different workflows and they're very

00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:46,140
excited about it and

00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,540
because we can come up with a workflow

00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:55,500
that really works it's really exciting

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:57,780
and it can save you tons of time and so

00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,600
people are a little enthusiastic to

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,250
share that and they're oftentimes are

00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,050
willing to you know the time with you

00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,030
and tell them like hey this is super

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,650
cool see how it works and even though

00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,690
they're not the people that created that

00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,510
tool you still get a sense of pride

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,580
apart finding an awesome solution

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:18,030
because you know it it takes a lot of

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:20,090
work to be able to I'm the one that

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,490
works for you

00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:39,870
so I have five minutes left that is

00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:41,520
actually the end of my talk so what I

00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,590
also do blogging for SiteLock and I've

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,350
done some blogging on the staging sites

00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,270
so it's the one we have up there is

00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,060
really only on the username with your

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:54,420
site I'm working a little more developer

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,980
kind of blogging well so please feel

00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,880
free to look take a look up there it

00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,200
gets it gives much more in-depth so I'm

00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,800
wondering does anybody have any

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,800
questions

00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:16,559
yeah if we set up a shtetl upstaging

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,950
site on sub-domain how do you recommend

00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:23,160
the best way to get out of the eyes and

00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:25,710
Richards web crawlers like music

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,470
maintenance mode or something so and

00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,210
then you can at least set up like an HD

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,210
access kind of level thing where you're

00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,670
having a login to that a lot of the ones

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:44,040
like I'm hosting they will automatically

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:45,540
do it for you so it can't be found what

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,849
I do but you don't want anyone to ever

00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,640
go to that site at all so maintenance

00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:53,130
mode is sort of a solution up getting

00:44:50,640 --> 00:45:03,450
your via robots you know so it's not

00:44:53,130 --> 00:45:04,740
your sex not being but that is important

00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,780
that is something that I didn't really

00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,220
talk about is you want to make sure that

00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,460
your staging site is not going to be

00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,440
crawled by Google so making sure that

00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,309
it's not findable is definitely

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:29,069
something that you need to clinically

00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:31,549
yeah have you ever used word oh no is it

00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:31,549
awesome

00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:49,030
okay Speleers rob22 there's a ruby day

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:51,130
I've never even heard of it no but I bet

00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,690
somebody that's using it successfully is

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,690
very happy to talk to you about it

00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,590
when you're using like local Wi-Fi

00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,190
because I'm looking at these

00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:14,470
I do all of our posting you know behind

00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,480
the scenes of domain but with something

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,100
like logo by flywheel is there a way

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,830
that other developers from other

00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,920
locations can work concurrently or diff

00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:26,170
to zip it up and share and move around

00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:31,240
do you know there was someone in the

00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:36,160
back that corrected me on local being

00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:38,110
available to is that person still here

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,020
in the end to that because I firstly

00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:42,970
don't know I haven't used local but I do

00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:47,640
know people that lose it and they love

00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:50,440
it it does it provides a lot more

00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,260
developer tools than desktop server

00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,910
desktop server provides some and I know

00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,090
that they're working on coming out with

00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:09,340
a major version upgrades I don't know

00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:12,430
what there are but they're here yeah so

00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:25,600
like that can be something that I don't

00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:27,580
know exactly yeah yeah so one thing

00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,190
that's one thing that local does do I

00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,450
think desktop superbaby is in the work

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,790
they're doing it or they just recently

00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,440
started is that usually when they're

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,090
coming your site well really no one else

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,220
can see it but you because it's not on

00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:42,650
the internet local has a solution that

00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:47,150
allows somebody from another remote

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:49,160
location to look at your local site not

00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,050
really answering the question but that's

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,030
what he was kind of mentioning that

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:54,920
maybe if you're doing development for

00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,750
client in you want to say hey here do

00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,400
you want to take a look at this you

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:18,400
don't have to push it up to like you

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:18,400
