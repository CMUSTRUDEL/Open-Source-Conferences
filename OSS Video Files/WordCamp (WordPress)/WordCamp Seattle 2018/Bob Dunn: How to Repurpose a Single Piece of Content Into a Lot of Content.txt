[Music]

00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:58,640
[Applause]

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,449
so I have been doing this 11 years

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,020
talking a lot of loggers and coaching

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,060
training interesting when I meet

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,450
somebody I mean get talking about

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,240
walking is always up to inspectors how's

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,570
it going I'm excited now they just get

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,540
all Japanese blogging and all content

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,070
going out then to the other end of the

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,070
spectrum how funny

00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:34,320
cute because they know that they have to

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:39,360
blog and now they feel guilty you're

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,620
gonna have to admit last time and then

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,960
there's everybody and the problem is

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:51,570
walking is tough and then for a long

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:54,750
time and I've discovered the dog in

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,990
different ways the great content and

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,740
purpose content but it's a never-ending

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:05,130
thing got only coming up with ideas

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,140
this time changes the medium changes the

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,490
opportunities out there change that's

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,470
where this comes in now I'm going to

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,470
talk about two things here and twofold

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,570
one is this how to take a simple piece

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,530
of content naturally make more confident

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:23,010
yeah the part that is central to that is

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,290
refreshing your current content and that

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,910
is just as critical and you can find a

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,730
lot of use for it and maybe it doesn't

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,520
great tons of content but you're already

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,840
using some people already done and

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,110
likely something

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:43,860
successful so far so why do we want to

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,290
do this three reasons I make ourselves

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,840
happy because the tire and avoid

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,090
generating new ideas thinking the new

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,019
content sweating and eyes whatever your

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,209
problem is with blogging it's ourselves

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,510
we want to make ourselves happy I make a

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,480
Reavers happy keep pushing content out

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:07,170
they find useful they find educational

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,870
but they keep coming back to me and if

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,599
Google ain't happy ain't nobody happy

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,840
that's really the bottom line I mean we

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:19,410
we are you know bow into the Google dog

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,730
and we might eat Google happy with our

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,489
content so what I do is really a mix of

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,430
all three of these things it's really

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,260
combining them all figuring out you know

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,340
I can make my life a little bit more

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,470
enjoyable document my readers happy and

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,700
how the search engines will continue to

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,930
find me talk about I've done myself

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,780
since I've been dead for few months

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,079
offense I've done it for years so it's

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,329
not i'm just projecting what might I

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:56,250
could tell you for a fact see the stuff

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:59,099
works I'm going to be talking about

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,069
internal links a lot now how many of you

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:05,459
have heard people talk okay got it

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,519
inbound links externally I mean you

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,989
probably heard that in various Oh

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,819
SEO sessions here they were it's such a

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,549
huge thing but what we don't think about

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,519
is our internal links those are the

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,490
links that are within our blog we keep

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,669
it other posts our own content and those

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,060
are just is

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,979
the reason being is that Google Doc I'm

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,569
a very low tech person's higher

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:35,370
described things I'm not going to get

00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:38,259
into why I've just peddle the concept

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,749
the term links basically get Google

00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:44,080
roadmap and helps them that understand

00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:45,550
the kind of content you have and what

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,169
you're talking about a lot and makes

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,180
more sense to them so when they go from

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,879
link to link to link when they're doing

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,069
their thing that Google does that saying

00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,069
hey this makes sense because this is

00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:58,360
showing me what this blog is about and

00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,490
that's what internal links are so

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,639
important that's what we've purposing is

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,770
a huge part of that is making sure that

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,289
not only we do open you write that first

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,250
post but that you're going in and

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:15,340
actually mentally remembering to go in

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,680
and make more internal links happened

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,479
and then that be common sense of

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,400
turbulence I can't be forced

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,680
you know you want flow in your content

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,139
you want to relate your content and

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:32,740
don't do it just in the statement

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:37,509
innovating so as I mentioned updating

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,789
content is huge this is probably one of

00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,819
the biggest factors that I grow my

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:46,089
audience I grow my search outreach I

00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,529
grow my organic search because of this

00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,089
and there's really three different

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:54,490
things that I'm going to be talking

00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:59,610
about the post your content waits turns

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:02,020
and twists so tweets not that we tweak a

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,460
little easy

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,280
this is that you're going to go back

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,380
into your post you've got to change out

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,880
early you're going to add a little bit

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,849
of content put it internally give it

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,880
whenever you are and if I look at this

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,130
they might be talking about how I get a

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,599
few tiny goals but this is the back of

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,669
your head when you're doing other stuff

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,069
when you're going in and doing other

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,900
work on a post or maybe there's another

00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,539
reason to drive you into edit that post

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,320
somebody tweeted hey you know your first

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,009
paragraph has three misspellings so you

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,990
go in there

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,780
maybe that's the time and say okay I've

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,660
got a review this post and see if I can

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,630
boost it up and those of us this is just

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,680
updating post so you do something quick

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:54,550
update another example this is I

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,710
monetize my sidewalk building stuff like

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,470
that so when I'm in there I'm thinking

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:04,000
hey you know there's some way I can

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:06,639
logically and make it readable to put in

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,990
the filling in there or have I written

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,150
for other posts since I did this post

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,120
that actually talked about the same copy

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,060
that I can easily have a paragraph and

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,490
leave to those give people another step

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,780
to go out and learn more about specific

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:29,530
area maybe I just touched on that points

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,870
so that is really important to go in and

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,599
keep those posts updates now one of the

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,150
things I really encourage you to do is

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,430
get up

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,070
and Google app analytics like Google

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,250
Analytics something that you can start

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,460
watching your posts find those high rank

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,560
equals those are your goal line

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,590
find those and go in there and do stuff

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,720
to it just because you'd be out doing

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,540
good you know this is number two of me

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,100
but this is a month whatever you know do

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,100
the conversions you have to look at that

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,639
but also look at it ask what can I do to

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:11,430
make it better better for me better for

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:16,220
my readers so those o revising that post

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:19,650
is very important now you go to the

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,320
cracking post the post that you look at

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,720
and then ped updated they don't really

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,720
relate anymore they don't

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,330
copy

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:34,650
like just garbage and you going through

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,200
and you thinking okay I'm gonna clean

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:41,120
these things out now you got to make the

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,660
decision you can take the easy way go in

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,010
delete it and but always make sure you

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,070
put a redirect

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:53,130
I will plugins yo system will allow you

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,080
to do a redirect so redirected sumner on

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,700
to your site designing your home page

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,020
like you don't want redirects

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,230
so what I can do is that go in and I

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,940
look at it I have to pull leave it

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,910
innovative to think of often I make this

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,830
post alive again I'll go in there now

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,529
work with the SEO I'll work with it

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,950
maybe the keywords I work with the title

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,430
change a pilot maybe it's so obsolete

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,589
that I think something's a similar topic

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:27,150
totally rewrite it and still leave it as

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,730
that publish post so then it's not

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,150
always a matter of getting it rid of all

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,800
those posts that are new

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,529
these that are driving traffic that are

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,690
making conversions it's you're gonna

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,339
you're gonna find out that I can give

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,240
you examples here but you're going to

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,670
find your own which I say you're gonna

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,800
find your own creative way to do this is

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,240
a really dependent contact make

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,000
audiences looking for but I think I want

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,910
to give you some guidance and that's

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,620
where this is you know so don't don't

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,020
always just delete delete delete

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,910
unless it's maybe a post about some

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,190
workshop you did three years ago maybe

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,490
it's time to get rid of that and just

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,490
put a redirect or put even a you know on

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,160
the ozone I can't remember what it's

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,570
called it's not a for for but it's

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,510
another one that just basically says

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:28,480
this contest God is buried its history

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:31,510
now the big one is a twist I do this the

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,740
most on my site and what I mean by this

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,440
this is work so you don't have little

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,350
revised tweets and I'm going to give an

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,690
example of my sight when I write out and

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,620
hopefully and relate that when you write

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,500
about and content I write about others

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:55,959
let's do I write a lot of tutorials on

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,709
onions and most plugins update and they

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,290
change so I look at my analytics and I

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:06,550
see well what posts are really ranking

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,500
high and I'm still pulling in equal to

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,150
these posters so reading them and I'm

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,930
looking at I think wow that Klingon

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:17,529
changed a lot the last two years so I

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:23,020
basically rewrite it but in do

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:26,680
screenshots and do the whole shebang and

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,870
what I knew is and this is the important

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,840
part is if it's a high rank inside a

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,760
hierarchy post you don't want

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,330
you're going to take it down to a draft

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,920
folded you're going to update it then

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,650
you're going to be scheduling send the

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,300
dominating content why is that great

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:48,130
evening readers is pissed off they start

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,470
to see things that I published a lot

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,600
more than likely depending on your

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,160
traffic people are lands nearby searched

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,870
and they're not paying attention to what

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,240
let's come out with so do that and

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:06,400
there's something really important to

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:12,160
remember when doing this if it's a high

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,130
rating post and people are finding it in

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:21,340
the search engines

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:24,550
don't touch the time like why why fix a

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,800
wheel the temporal really great they're

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,620
looking at you know this tile is working

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,150
for it's already trying to beat traffic

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,620
there people are searching and they're

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,030
looking for something and maybe they're

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,100
looking for an answer and they're

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,670
clicking through so don't don't miss

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,790
with the title unless it really doesn't

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,160
fit the topic it's such a rewrite that

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,080
you just think and if it's a bid you

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,250
know post it doesn't have much ranking

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,280
hey go for it

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,110
dang whatever you want because it's not

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,880
being ranked having that a lot of leads

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,800
out there as long as you still think you

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,080
know what are my feet what is Google

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,450
looking forward to that title but are my

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,910
readers or that her linking goes a

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,550
little bugger begin a lot of trouble

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,010
with people will say well I'm going to

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,690
change a permalink because and the slug

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,390
at the end of it because that's going to

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:20,250
be Google life to some people need a

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,090
Google that is this lot of no really

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,890
sir whatever that's not the worst part

00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,880
of changing that thing you just had to

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,970
change that then every out link that you

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,430
have out there on this you do a redirect

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:39,180
pull them out they'll get a 404 error

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,220
page so i really suggest when you redo

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,920
those a high-ranking post

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,680
don't touch the title don't touch it

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,020
firmly it's working for you so far

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,880
likely you're just still waiting on the

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,400
same copy and you want to keep that

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,640
google deuce going so don't mess with it

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,830
I've tested this a little bit off the

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,490
mountain and it can really screw things

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,830
up that post it can be ranking you know

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,870
your tenth I post suddenly goes off the

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,520
charts

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:14,450
the other piece is if any of you use how

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:20,100
to do how many views Yoast SEO plugin

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:22,650
five beauties of this is very again the

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,300
venue slug down there make sure you know

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,990
to go to change the Tyrol you can change

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,990
Michael you want me do

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:39,900
again it's it's it's driving traffic

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,030
there don't don't get this assembly

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,410
enlightening you know come back on the

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:49,650
work of having three cocktails this

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,750
would sound better you know don't don't

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,550
touch it

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,650
key words you can play it if you're into

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,190
the keyword party so play around with it

00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,620
you can do that now if you go to

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,920
actually redoing the post that sucks in

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:09,270
the first place and not gonna give you

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,250
crappy hey glad you wouldn't feel will

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,720
change it get the traffic you need

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,160
change the phone

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,300
change of whatever you know but every

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,920
directly but otherwise just

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:26,529
is it don't run you drive traffic to

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:30,319
your site you don't want to stop that

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:32,420
now this this point I'm going to take it

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,930
really well because I realized I left an

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,389
entire slide off my presentation so I'm

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,560
going to sneakily turn the next slide

00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,360
and the slide

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,709
without me knowing it even though I've

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,139
already told you well what we're at now

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:50,029
this is a perfect time for your purposes

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,550
we have so many mediums we have audio

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:55,069
video you know video has been the

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,560
biggest thing coming in to us for the

00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:59,120
last five years every year I've heard

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,910
videos give me the biggest this year

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,310
goes by pretty big video you can see

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,589
this next year next year next video is

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,690
going to be big it needs to be big and

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:12,529
we know it's one of the mediums out

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:17,930
there probably on podcast occasion I run

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:20,540
two 5s ran many for those are big but

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,839
think of all the different stuff you

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:26,389
have or the opportunities I should say

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,199
that you have in your content you create

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:33,199
a single piece of content now and you

00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:37,160
have all these other mediums when I was

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,259
doing a podcast and with audio only I

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,759
thought how weird is it to create a

00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:46,490
video by pocket you'd be like because

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,759
there's actually systems in places with

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,310
cycle repurposed IO that will take your

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,560
audio not I'm not the greatest video and

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,649
uploaded to YouTube and it has that you

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,150
know kind of little of sound wave on it

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,850
and dancing around that

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:05,770
get out of motion and I thought why will

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:08,630
somebody play on your only on a video I

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,589
asked a few people they said hey I do it

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,110
all the time how many times do you put

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,850
on a video where there's just some

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,890
pocket heads and you start doing other

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,980
work there and stare at those two people

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,870
talking forever now you don't likely

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,120
unless you're infatuated with their

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,270
faces or something or there's something

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,160
that drives you to watching it there's

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,640
the opportunity there so when you've got

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,760
video

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,880
you obviously have audio you can

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,510
describe the extract so you have all

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:44,120
these different mediums now that you can

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:47,270
take a single piece of content and turn

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,059
it into uh I mean just on your site

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,190
alone so get creative with the video it

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:58,460
created with the audio those are just

00:17:52,190 --> 00:18:02,030
you know to to mediate but people just

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,730
aren't people consume stuff in so many

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,630
different ways you might like video you

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,580
might like audio you might like text you

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,230
might occasionally like video if you

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,390
like audio sometimes we feel the

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,010
difference and you like that to be like

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,220
video of disses might put maybe like

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,110
text a little bit so everybody's looking

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,360
for that content this is really cool

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,380
plugin called Amazon Polly's that I use

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:31,309
I install it and what it does is I only

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,559
use it on my post I have just text only

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,400
and what it does is basically creates an

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:39,950
audio automatically if your post you

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,410
select from a beautiful voices and if

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,130
it's about p.m. and somebody can listen

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,240
to your post

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,309
hi I mean how easy is that why shouldn't

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,730
you do that if you say

00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:55,460
my voice you know life you know I mean

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,830
you've got odd cast yeah that's a new

00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,519
voice but somebody just wanted to hear

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:04,159
your post audience and what's cool about

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:07,129
Amazon poly is you can hide and show

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:10,190
things so what you can say this let's

00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:12,350
say I have an entire post and I say go

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,759
to go to my site somewhere in that well

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,330
that really helped somebody

00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,870
ah you are I go and I say go to the site

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,240
where I don't actually say the site I

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:29,809
want to see it differently in text but I

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:32,899
want to verbally say goto.com and check

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:36,249
so I can tell Amazon Poly's what to show

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:39,889
the post and what's only for the D audio

00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:41,720
so if you have one screenshot and you're

00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:44,629
thinking about to use them with some

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,039
poly but that's reshot simple but I

00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,409
don't really explain it

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,269
just do the screenshot write out an

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:54,080
explanation of what that screenshot is

00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:57,559
hiding from the actual post and a pop

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,590
see the doggy of your placement so it's

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,350
it's it's Pepin underused plug it and

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,389
it's work great online so so make sure

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:09,950
you do all of this of all these

00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:12,860
different mediums extractions this is

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,080
the other way to create now here's where

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,090
you've gotta decide on your content and

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,350
how to get creative with it and I'm

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,210
going to be talking about Google good

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,929
content a little bit here with all dress

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,669
as well what I mean by extractions

00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:29,720
attractions is one of the oldest things

00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:33,110
in repurposing your content and I'll

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,220
I'll give you an example of this you

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:40,519
create end Twitter tips Doug you just

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,230
have 10 poster you know I'm not I'm not

00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,200
talking

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:48,669
courtesy is easy it's a matter of taking

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:51,039
what you have and building accessible I

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,389
mean vollis are already doing that if

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,399
you just would not do it in to the

00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:57,309
extent getting a little creative so you

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,230
have ten different posts and with her

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,419
the poll about that is you can elaborate

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,049
on those posts get more into depth about

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:07,690
each one of those tips and inner leaflet

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,059
so neither John will you know Twitter

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:13,029
longer at all all this content leading

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:17,250
people to more educational content about

00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:20,289
activity post and that's worldwide I

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:23,620
knew the night for while I was doing

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:25,179
transcripts on my podcast and I did

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,149
these transcripts they were like you

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:32,440
know massive transcripts me balance the

00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:34,870
words and I started thinking okay I got

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,870
I gotta put my brain out here and think

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,340
what did what's a way to really do

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,639
something with these transfers and I

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,080
realized that every my transcript is

00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:51,460
interview so I'm asking that question

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,830
specifically for a specific part of that

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,200
interview so let's say let's go to ten

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,519
tips of Twitter and I mean I'm just

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,130
throwing something out the top of my

00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,649
head so I make up hockey do the Twitter

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,080
maybe I'm talking to Bridget who did the

00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:08,559
keynote and she's after you maybe one of

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:12,100
the questions is is what's the best way

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,159
to make product conversions using

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,120
Twitter well that's buried in that

00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,399
podcast transcript but I can take out

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,820
that particular chunk of it put it in a

00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:28,750
post and tile it how to make more

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,610
conversions for your body on Twitter now

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm going to show you how you know a new

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,000
duplicate content there so

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,860
you're gonna want to do make sure that

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Google doesn't say oh but the point is

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,350
now unable to drive people through

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,710
social by putting that title that one

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:52,340
question that those people that are is

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,370
driving them nuts what to do help

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,179
conversions the products from Twitter

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,890
they're going to be driven to that

00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,840
single post and then I'm going to in

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,880
that post I'm going to see a not you can

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,950
go here Brigitte talk all about Twitter

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,690
and hopefully I meet them over to the

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,760
podcast so I've asked you a specific

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,799
question created another piece of

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,029
content and I could realistically go

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,279
through and do that with everyone who

00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:15,559
questions are afterward and the the

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,389
whole thing is is I'm driving people to

00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:25,549
my site because it ask me something

00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:28,700
specific but if it's something that hits

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:31,250
a nerve with me ninety products I want

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,049
my hurt I want to use Twitter and I'm

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,649
more likely to go to that than just in

00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:39,769
general and juice and I'll read it and

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:42,169
even if you don't move to the pole odd

00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:47,299
cast you've already maybe got a new

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:49,190
reader and this is just one example so

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,070
look at your content I mean the

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,250
interview tips anything that you can

00:23:52,070 --> 00:24:00,590
elaborate on that's basically every

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,809
don't don't think you know is you can

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,029
generate it in and I'm doing it from a

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,950
transcript than I could actually then

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,490
pull out that particular piece of the

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,799
video or the audio audio on my page and

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,610
I can have that a separate little audio

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:19,490
and maybe I can add it there or I use

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,740
Amazon Pali to create an audio on that

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:26,680
post the thing is with repurposing your

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,320
content wishing take it

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,870
peace is really looking at it from all

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,150
angles and understanding what your

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,390
readers want how you want them to find

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:40,150
out what's going to drive them there but

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:45,640
you're sharing it on Twitter to an

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:47,470
organic search whatever so I I wish I

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,160
had an example for every one of these

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,740
but you can pretty much get where do you

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,770
pull out that I can't tell you how many

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,090
times I've pulled out content I was able

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,800
to repurpose it into something else and

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,510
that's the whole key to it it's you know

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,640
I'd love to stay here's a little red

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,500
pill want you all the take you're going

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,750
to go home you're going to sit there as

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,930
they kick in you could have this moment

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,790
of euphoria and all this sudden of the

00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,040
contents could regurgitate onto your

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,940
blog and you didn't have to do a thing

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,590
because the bottle of red pill well as

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,889
you can guess know

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:32,379
this one poster soul I know a guy and

00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:37,299
very successful what he does and what he

00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:41,409
does is on Monday he sends out an email

00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:43,960
to his email list with an article he

00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:48,429
takes that same article on Tuesday puts

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,830
it on his blog on Wednesday he creates a

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:54,879
video on it where he's talking about

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:58,570
that particular one on Thursday he

00:25:54,879 --> 00:26:02,919
doesn't podcast on he does what he's a

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:05,259
Content essentially one idea and every

00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,720
week create four pieces of content and

00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:10,169
he has thousands of subscribers is he

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,499
just you know twists turns it over

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:16,629
it'll be dimming him talking on video

00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:20,470
versus maybe on the podcast it's a

00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:22,899
little bit more subdued you know and but

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:28,169
he always meets his readers that first

00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:28,169
look out and that makes him feel special

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:40,210
and he does this time and his audience

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:42,220
has figured that out they can be engaged

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,919
okay this is coming through I want to

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,809
hear this one you know audio before I'm

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,419
one-quarter podcast I want to see him

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:53,499
talking about it on a video I can look

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:56,619
gorgeous that baby about me very unique

00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:59,710
I I couldn't believe how wealthy and he

00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:02,309
just hasn't yet streamlines he has his

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,309
workload

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:10,630
so that I used to do a some of my most

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:15,030
popular posts in the world were videoed

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:18,210
with a Genesis child theme tutorials

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,860
what I would do is I'd create two videos

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,630
one filled them I'll he could set it up

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,540
as a demo one showed them what they

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,870
can't do without moon code then I did

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,520
this long post with it that pretty much

00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,350
explained everything that explained in

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,380
the video and those are some of the

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,450
popular posts most popular tutorials I

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,850
had on my site there's still going back

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,490
a bit they're like four years old I

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,990
think there'd be some more how's David

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:47,320
but people are still going back to those

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:51,040
I used to do a podcast that I would do a

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,800
video and audio and I do a post time so

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,590
every week you go to that post every

00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:01,000
Friday there's video be talking it I

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,650
just pull out the the audio cool thing

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,030
about pull out the audio then you can

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,820
create a podcast out of it you can

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,830
stream it into iTunes a lactam stuff and

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,380
then I also wrote a post on it so people

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,810
got there and they had a choice well I

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,400
listen to I thought but probably people

00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,730
didn't watch bottles missions they want

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,680
to listen to it or read it but it was an

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,360
option and was easy for me to just pump

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,850
that stuff out here that basically

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,070
created both first this easy to make

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,130
video from that and then we just pulling

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,020
out the audio from the video and I did

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,020
that back again with a very popular

00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:38,520
podcast took a little bit more work but

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,520
people loved it because that options

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,170
[Music]

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,410
so social so social have a social place

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:59,760
into this and we get kind of a low

00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:12,850
produced we don't think of social really

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:14,410
our Sheriff so it's not necessary

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,660
purchasing and you really think about

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,670
the concept for social because they are

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,250
reporting commenting different people

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:25,080
you know group of people and kind of

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:30,640
drag them to it now if you look at

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,680
LinkedIn and Facebook and Google+ or

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,300
however much longer you actually do

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,270
exist which I don't think it's too much

00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:41,430
longer you know you have a work kind of

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:43,630
like Twitter so what I do sometimes

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,520
instead of using that you know a little

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:49,840
better description I'll pull it in the

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,540
first paragraph I kind of you know three

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,510
purpose of content and put it in for my

00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,270
share instead of trying to ink up

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:02,170
something new now that seems like a

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:05,320
no-brainer LinkedIn I mean even do

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:08,500
LinkedIn articles LinkedIn articles is

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,430
like repurposed bill right there for you

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,770
because the best way to do a leads in

00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:18,730
article is to write a post on those ten

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:13,299
social justifying unique ways I mean

00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:15,909
when you think of repurposing your

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:17,919
content if you look like a store video

00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:20,289
there's a lot of services out there will

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,299
do snippets of stuff for you create a

00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,039
short little video and then the way

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,929
that's repurposing it is you've already

00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,360
created this video you can sure this

00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:31,419
shorter video on Facebook drive people

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,269
to wherever your other video videos or

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,519
audio how many times you've seen

00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:39,870
podcasts that put in you'll put some

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:44,009
teaser and they'll go ahead I used to do

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:47,350
like the first I pull out nugget of

00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:49,570
something yes Ted and I'd create a short

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,730
video and I put it on Facebook even

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,320
though that's you know promotional

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,659
marketing however you want to say it

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,990
it is repurposing because I was able to

00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:07,149
find that specific piece that people who

00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:10,539
go up that's cool so again it's it's a

00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:12,100
matter of getting great it's a minute

00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:19,000
ending and you probably sitting there

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:22,750
going yeah you know I I wanted that pill

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,269
but when you're gonna find this that as

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,250
you go you know hopefully this stuff

00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:30,220
will stick in your head you're gonna

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:33,590
find your own ways to do this that's the

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,440
beauty of a lot of the stuff I did

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:41,330
that I've done I had nobody ever told me

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,330
to do it I just thought we might content

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:49,340
up can i repurpose this I've got a lot

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:51,080
of content and like I said before those

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,760
analytics are going to be critical

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,429
because you want to know the content

00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:00,169
let's do want to be confident great and

00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:02,720
you want to build more content around

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,929
those ranking posts and you it's it's

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,110
kind of like I'm trying to think of an

00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:11,870
analogy but you've got this gold mine

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:14,059
already on it why not take advantage of

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,880
it and especially with that in early

00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,919
need I go to some sites and it's like my

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,039
god you're missing out you're not

00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:25,179
connecting the dots you're not sending

00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,929
me you know that really gonna say Oh

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:32,450
mistresses second time obviously but

00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:34,309
given that options where people yeah you

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,039
know this is this is a part I really

00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:39,679
wanted to know more about and I've

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,620
actually started writing posts always

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,809
with repurposing in mind and that's

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,669
another thing is from here on out you

00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:50,360
write the post me do I need to give it

00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:53,570
all the way here or can I teach them and

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,840
I'll be teasing them by you know doing

00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,470
some headline that's going to not live

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,090
up to this you know but said basically

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,309
I'm talking about giving them enough

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,990
stuff that they can walk away at that

00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,450
point feeling good about it

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,139
feeling good about your puppet but at

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,820
the same time you know I wanted to click

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,220
through I want to see that mean that

00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,720
bookmark if they don't have time so they

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:22,659
put through they book market they come

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,659
back or they just are they watching

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:32,450
duplicate content so I've talked a lot

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,349
about this and everybody always freaks

00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:38,770
out my pocket

00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:42,790
their content Google is like you know

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:44,950
they've got like this Calabar is waiting

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,450
for you when you do duplicate content

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,240
we're going to penalize you you're gonna

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:51,280
be sink into the hole the destined to

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,510
hell and you know everything's gonna

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:59,650
explode well both of you are using Yoast

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,869
SEO and again I'm not a real technical

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:05,079
person so I go to these people I trust

00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:08,530
them to tell me what to do give a so far

00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,520
let me is great I listen to them good

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,260
they know what they're talking about

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,559
they spent a lot more time doing this

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:20,680
stuff and there's a filthy pulp in a

00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:23,619
couple weeks and I'm economical URL now

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,109
I can get into the technical definition

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,599
of it and I've written a post on my blog

00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:30,730
by the time you're out of this room room

00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,010
that goes over all this stuff and has

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:37,690
some links to this so the only to my

00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:40,299
babies close but it but this URL does so

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,140
let's go back to my transcript my

00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:43,299
transcript

00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,670
this is long being that pull out

00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:47,609
actually you can duplicate content cuz i

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,680
pasted in one part of that transcript

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:55,390
when i go in there i've put in the URL

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,910
of my main podcast and what if i tell me

00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:01,059
Google and telling Google that don't pay

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:05,280
attention to this so much as that other

00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,280
stuff is that's really where this game

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,230
if you want to go videos they got a

00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:16,319
whole thing but that's kind of be in the

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:19,059
nutshell and wherever you hit the boost

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,160
so you're saying okay now Bob not really

00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:24,130
to do this because then maybe the search

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,140
engines don't I'll start ranking that

00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,450
making me talk but that doesn't mean you

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,780
can

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:31,490
sure out still drive people to it and

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,980
that's kind of the purpose of that other

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,079
little piece and it's the purpose of

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,900
also being a little bit lazy and

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,369
dropping it in there but as long as you

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,890
do that you're not going to get popped

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:45,500
for duplicate content because you are

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,300
telling Google that you tell the search

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,050
engines however you're telling them I

00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:54,619
have no idea how this works but it is

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:56,750
saying that hey you know this is a post

00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:01,280
that really you should be seriously

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:03,650
looking at this post right folders so

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,060
you're still sending that over Google to

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:13,730
get that little bit of juice whatever

00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:16,099
that is but that's important and Yost

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:19,210
has a bright built-in you can just go

00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:22,940
down there often that URL anything to go

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:27,410
like I said I've gotta leave notes and

00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,630
just canonical go ahead and search it

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:32,030
there and get though you have way more

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:36,349
information than you probably ever wanna

00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:41,619
know about this but it's important

00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:41,619
because duplicate content in the master

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,970
so as I get kind of wrapping up there a

00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:54,680
couple things I touched the tip of the

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:57,040
iceberg if you think of repurposing your

00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,890
content I mean you're in Seattle

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,260
satellites to recycle you know that's

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,890
that's it you're recycling your content

00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,170
you're not

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,749
you're not being a bad person putting it

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:12,619
in the content pile with all the other

00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:15,470
crappy content baby content so there's

00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,450
all these options that you have to

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,140
repurpose more content we just look

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,710
through them

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,450
I ran a online course worldwide I'm have

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,349
about everything you could possibly I've

00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:30,140
done all that stuff

00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:32,539
and I'm not doing any more but I did

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,789
this on my first IV straight courses on

00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:36,710
there well at one point I decided I

00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:43,460
don't want to do this anymore for

00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:45,470
various reasons but a very negative

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,960
thing but I looked at this and I thought

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,680
my god I have a lot of content here so

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,549
what did I do

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,890
I created a bunch of posters or left so

00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:58,819
of course I just basically most of them

00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:00,499
is hopes now and I probably got more bad

00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:03,289
than out of them than I ever did with

00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:05,660
the freaking online course I got more

00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:18,349
traffic like people coming in like oh my

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:20,119
god this is amazing so I you know I did

00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:24,349
that I did that I have a membership site

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:27,680
the same thing protects content then I

00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:30,890
stopped that hey there young people it's

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,130
a world ebooks we've written for e-books

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:36,140
those are not long clothes yeah that's

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,570
how I gave me a way to you know whatever

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:42,300
if I'm getting in here

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:44,339
some of our most popular posts maybe I'm

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,920
not collecting names or subscribers from

00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:49,349
it you cannot solve it anymore but the

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,810
benefit is different it reads a lot so

00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:56,670
so all these different things

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:59,190
there's tons of content so though I

00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,070
think oh you know there were many times

00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,800
that I feel the Common Core sucks

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:07,369
wait bye this is up nobody's doing this

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,589
I didn't think that about all right I

00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:13,530
got some comment I did last January I

00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:16,200
need a 48-hour marathon content nerve I

00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,940
decided to get this in my head but I was

00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:23,250
going to push out these content on my

00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:26,460
blog once every out for now I don't wish

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:29,190
that on anybody I spent a lot of time

00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,560
working on that beside what I was

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,820
putting out at the time and it was an

00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,880
interesting experience

00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,190
oh that's kind of me with that but the

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,440
thing is what I realized when I will

00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:44,160
bring it out all those top did break

00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,109
pieces I got that stuff out fast people

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,770
are like wow you know I missed that miss

00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:52,010
that so what I did is I went back and

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:55,050
one by one I took them off the grid

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,300
republish it oh that's a great post

00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,480
because they missed it for you yeah lot

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,339
of great content that I was able to

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,589
repurpose I mean that's not the idea

00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:05,910
that's really coming same part I'm

00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,770
thinking I'm going to repurpose content

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,990
so I'm going to you know where do

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,690
you see content 48 hours you know that

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,590
really is

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:16,540
that's lunacy you know it's but it was

00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:19,900
something I kind of challenge myself to

00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,350
do and in the end I thought wow you know

00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,230
I really got a lot out of this so I I've

00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:29,260
done a lot of really stupid things in my

00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:32,140
business and I did it but I've always

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:36,610
found a way to recoup from that and

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:39,670
repurpose even huge now as I said the

00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,550
beginning I said I never did I could see

00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:50,950
this one gonna be I am not like the word

00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:55,810
easy it does take I mean you know like I

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:57,760
said it's not going to happen but there

00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:01,090
are ways you can do it that are less

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,990
taxing on you a lot of them I mentioned

00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:07,780
you know the simple updating taking

00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,540
content repurposing and pulling out

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:14,070
audio training video maybe an eye on the

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,750
video and do audio maybe you don't like

00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:19,270
whatever the case really go through your

00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:23,080
content and everything I've talked about

00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:25,120
think about how can I do this you know

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,290
it's not a magic bullet but it will

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,460
really get you

00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:32,850
I can guarantee you would be amazingly

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:35,170
surprised that's why I still do that

00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:37,690
been doing it for probably four or five

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,850
years and I'll continue to do it I keep

00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:44,070
going back to my post and I look at him

00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:47,250
and like I said take that moment when

00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:49,930
you go in to reply to the comment

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,390
anytime you're going into an old post

00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,380
Joy's

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:56,329
[Music]

00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:58,190
somebody shared it or like me I learned

00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:01,670
the whole pulse to teach myself

00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,809
something that I forgot so I go in you

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,819
know how did I do that

00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:07,279
oh I wrote I did a video on it so I

00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:10,009
watched myself tell me how to do it

00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:12,589
which is maybe why than tutorials is

00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:15,529
basically to help myself

00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:16,999
anybody else but I'll go in and I'll you

00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:18,559
know sometimes I'll say oh I won't

00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:21,079
disclose on this how to do and then I go

00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,420
and see oh that doesn't work but that's

00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:25,249
getting traffic but I have a better

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,589
solution so why don't I switch it out

00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:30,349
and put a better solution in here maybe

00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:32,299
it's a different plug-in or something

00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:35,390
that just works better than when I wrote

00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:38,089
that four years ago and in that case

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,700
then I would be published I get outside

00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:42,440
and pull I do a little quick change out

00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,469
write about a little bit but you're just

00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,140
articles panel to publish a new content

00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:52,279
and it's something I know people were

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:56,479
already interested i number one post is

00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:59,150
how to create new boss on WordPress site

00:43:56,479 --> 00:44:01,299
this has been my number one post to the

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,769
last 10 years

00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:06,319
ivory published it three times I've

00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:10,190
repurposed it as a result three times

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,930
I've changed links I've added videos can

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:16,719
anybody guess what this post is about

00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:19,009
it's really a simple idea categories

00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,009
it's telling people how to use

00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:25,999
categories on their site I've had over

00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:31,069
700 comments on the three different

00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:34,039
readers and that is one sucker that I've

00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:37,910
tried to repurpose and monetize that I

00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:40,969
just there's going to be those ones that

00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:42,940
you think oh this is a gold mine and no

00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:45,369
matter what you do

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,450
you think okay I hurt them and do this

00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:52,660
to me click on this link I just I don't

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:55,930
know it's like the demon of my blog

00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:59,609
because it's so freakin popular but I

00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:02,829
can't do anything but make people happy

00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:07,450
which is not a badly-needed so I leave

00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:10,390
it up and I do update so that is

00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:14,319
repurposing comment I mean it's it takes

00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,760
work just getting creative it's looking

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,140
at your own context everybody's gonna

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,150
write different kinds of projects you

00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:24,190
gotta start thinking how can I do this

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:28,150
to my content not easy but I'll updated

00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:36,480
them them over if there's any questions

00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:36,480
I might even be perfect here yeah

00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:45,589
oh no and long if you do all the things

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:47,780
I have said to do you know if duplicate

00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:51,470
content and trees or that genetically in

00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:54,109
there if you republish it you know I

00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,550
actually a thought I thought about that

00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:57,079
when I first started especially when I

00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,030
was pick it off the grid for a little

00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:02,180
while and then I would post it again I

00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:09,020
think Chucky telling somebody puppets

00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:12,530
the first that's like a good toe and I'm

00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:15,710
sorry I I did it at the risk of watching

00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:19,150
it to see if the traffic will go down or

00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:22,640
up depending on it I would say almost

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:25,520
95% of the time it never went down with

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,170
either state level or an increase so

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,800
that little bit of time off the grid

00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:34,520
never caused any problems so I I figured

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,930
Google must appease my awareness or

00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,360
whatever so I was able to do it I can

00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:48,150
yeah long as I just didn't screw up on

00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:50,490
my hand to confuse them oh I'm sure this

00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,950
yeah she said right through the console

00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:55,950
and have a reinvestment you know I I'm

00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:58,680
very lazy you know I kind of like okay

00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:02,900
this we're cool now move on what other

00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,900
one we're pretty things I can do

00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,749
[Music]

00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,910
yeah

00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:27,670
yeah and one thing I will mention is

00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,710
your comments you're going to have to

00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,450
make a judgment on this but post has

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,670
comments and you repurpose it and

00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:36,220
republish it Jim Bottomley those

00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,230
comments on there because suddenly your

00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,660
post has a date if you post you have a

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,300
date night and your comments have a

00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,860
prior date which most people won't pay

00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,290
attention but it bugged me

00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:54,130
so sometimes I'll actually remove all

00:47:47,290 --> 00:48:07,150
the comments because for me on my side

00:47:54,130 --> 00:48:10,690
or anything I do it because I feel like

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,030
my blog has new audience all the time

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,850
and I want that to suddenly be new

00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,590
content to a lot of new people I can

00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,410
push it out with new content on the

00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:23,740
Socialists so it's not really a a trick

00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:28,120
of the trade or makes it SEO better but

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:31,180
it does I view it as part of my recent

00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:35,620
repurpose is I don't wanna freakin write

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:37,960
another post so I didn't take it off the

00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,090
grid I can republish it new people

00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,200
people that started all in these since I

00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,080
wrote it two years ago

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,480
some people go back to it like wow you

00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,380
know they may be missed it so nobody has

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,690
ever told me

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,490
well you published that like - two years

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,359
ago Bob why are you doing I just did my

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:56,390
I just repurpose

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,999
purpose post when I published today for

00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:01,099
this I rewrote it a little bit more fit

00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:03,319
the stream with this took it out the

00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,920
grid and now a brand new post so it's

00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:10,579
really giving people of new readers or

00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,410
given those people exposure that they

00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:19,430
never got that two years ago so I'm

00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:21,859
counting on pulling it I if it's a

00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:24,410
high-ranking post on me and it's time

00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:26,209
for an hour I saw copy the post over

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,459
fitting into another thing you all mind

00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:32,229
whatever ball off take it off the big

00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:35,380
draft mode move it back over beast it in

00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:38,739
schedule don't publish it's different

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:41,869
something goes really just publish it

00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:43,749
you can change that's what I always

00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:46,749
found it was better to schedule

00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:46,749
appointment

00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,770
[Music]

00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,479
[Music]

00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:21,080
okay so maybe we have time for one more

00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,520
oh I change it once every published

00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:34,710
every change days yeah but the ones I

00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,460
just do a little tiny update to I leave

00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:41,250
them bats and cake so it's having the

00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,500
ones that really do major republishing

00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,990
this and often I was right about her

00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,210
prosthetic and it needs to reflect

00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:52,400
what's happening right now with that

00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,400
need that book so thank you all

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,669
[Applause]
