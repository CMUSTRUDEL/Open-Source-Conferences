Title: Kyle Maurer: What I Learned From Interviewing 200+ People in WordPress
Publication date: 2020-04-12
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Over the past five years, I’ve been running a weekly, one hour, live interview show featuring a new guest from the WordPress community every episode. During each interview I’ve attempted to get to know the guest, their interests, and their story. Along the way, I’ve learned a lot about the people who make up this community. In this session, I’d like to share hard data as well as some personal reflections I’ve gleaned from just listening to all the people who use and make WordPress.

good morning everybody today already

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,170
hearing from Bauer

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,209
his job is what I learned from

00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,000
interviewing to enough less people and

00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:19,010
WordPress cat works for San Phil's

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,680
development which is a WordPress funded

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,980
company with a variety of after products

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,710
easy digital downloads which Kyle spends

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,539
most of his time with you Kyle strongly

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,460
believes that humans are not mentally

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,590
unbalanced he's grateful that he has

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,270
found a profession and an employer which

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,159
permit him to lifestyle filled with

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,530
freedoms including the ability to travel

00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,719
frequently and explore new pursuits

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,460
a subject challenging can provide the

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,269
program and armament Isles favorite

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,300
pastimes

00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:49,829
the only conspiracy theory Kyle really

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,440
that printers are actually artificially

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,200
intelligent level initiators to attach

00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:02,150
our spirits please get warm welcome

00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:07,680
[Applause]

00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:11,330
alright good really excited to do with

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,280
you about four and a half years ago I

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,250
was getting involved in the WordPress

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,570
community just a little bit more I

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,710
expended attending work hands we

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,320
couldn't meet us and speaking it

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,180
somewhere kids and their publishing some

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,070
plans that I have made and really

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,960
starting to invest in this community I

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,820
have discovered and I wanted to go a

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,210
little deeper do a little more the one

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:38,640
day I saw someone post on Google+ of all

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:41,190
places remember it was a big for awhile

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,990
and so something posted there that they

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,170
repeat about starting a wordpress show

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,100
and what anybody wants of doing them and

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,229
I thought this would be perfect so I

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,740
responded and I joined and for the next

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,700
couple years I co-hosted the DVD ROM

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,729
table show along the way revolving door

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,850
of Provost's I was the only person who

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,040
really stuck around and that in that

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,649
period and after a couple years the last

00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,110
co-host stop showing up and so for the

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,360
two or three years since then I've just

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,819
been hosting the show on my own and it's

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,890
basically they get to know that

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,200
type show that's what I've made it into

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,599
I have never repeated a guest I've

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,249
interviewed a whole lot of people who

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,219
some people were in this room right the

00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:33,530
most matter-of-fact and it's been a very

00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:35,569
special experience somehow in that time

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,480
I've had an opportunity to talk

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:40,310
one-on-one with a whole lot of

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,849
fascinating people in this WordPress

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,370
space and and get to learn things from

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:47,689
them and about them and I was hoping

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,810
that I could just take this opportunity

00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:54,290
to share some of my reflections on this

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,389
experience with all of you and I want to

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,639
great those are questions into these

00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:01,760
three categories I learned a couple of

00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,560
things about just being generally the

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,069
people who are successful in upon

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,719
success in this industry a lot of things

00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,090
that they have explicitly totally

00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,189
one-of-a-kind interpreted from their

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,280
experiences and stories I've learned a

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,780
lot of things about the makeup of this

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,419
community and the people that it

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,430
consists of and along the way I learned

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,430
a few things about myself and managing

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,739
to maintain it

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,150
this final project of sorts which is

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,040
where I want to start briefly in this

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,989
part about a couple of things that I

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,989
learned about managing a science project

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,739
and learning to engage this community a

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:45,470
little bit better so first off the other

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:50,180
day I went into my favorite coffee shop

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:54,829
and the barista greeted me and said good

00:03:50,180 --> 00:04:00,739
morning Kyle and usable and this was no

00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:01,890
this was me because I thought this was a

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,310
big moment like

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:08,300
I've done it achievement unlocked I

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,680
successfully went one place enough times

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,440
and one of the same thing that someone

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,290
asked me if I wanted been usual and that

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,450
was really special because it's a good

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,489
feeling right you know you know what I'm

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,580
talking about that that familiarity

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,560
which we all love don't want to go

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,270
places a feel like we're in Cheers

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,730
all the time and unfortunately much more

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,640
often instead of Cheers where we go we

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,180
feel more like the first day of a new

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,350
school freshmen here you guys should

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,790
know what I'm talking about I think

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,470
probably some of you feel like that

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,240
right now if your period your first word

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,220
camp

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,790
conferences are a great example of that

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,520
feeling where at the same time you're

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,630
here you're thinking to yourself please

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,480
someone notice me but also sees I don't

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,940
know what no this is me and that that

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,460
feeling of being a stranger so I'm very

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,850
familiar with that and but somehow well

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,669
if we're going to be in a lot of the

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,790
Council of Elrond you know where Frodo

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,240
is is there like a habit of all

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,830
creatures

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,660
it's a beautiful scene that just paints

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,650
the picture to me like how we all feel

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,570
and events like this where a hobbit a

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,610
hobbit of all creatures is sitting next

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,169
to like Wars and

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,620
it's talking about things they doesn't

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:37,009
understand at all way above his head

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,860
super cool seen that that's how we feel

00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:43,710
somehow I threw a lot of persistence I

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,990
was able to finally overcome this

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,060
feeling the sense of impostor syndrome

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,509
like everything's over my head and

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,699
everybody else knows more than I do and

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:57,060
that was pretty hard but a lot of it had

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,969
to do with me learning to find my own

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,800
place and appreciating the fact that my

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:06,110
place isn't the same as anybody else's

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,939
place I have learned over the time that

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,529
I'm not the charismatic length of the

00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,719
party and a person who can walk in and

00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,969
just make friends with everyone like

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,469
other people that I know but I am

00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:21,419
capable of running this this one on one

00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:24,509
conversation show and getting to talk to

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:27,990
people and have conversations in this

00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:31,319
format I can do that and so that's my

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,969
experience finding where I am able to

00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,710
fit in and do something that works for

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,409
me another thing that I found to be

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:41,099
really is

00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:45,249
active was scheduling with guests

00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:47,110
canceling this show really forced me to

00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,969
honor the commitment more than any other

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,309
side project and the tree didn't have a

00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:53,319
lot of side projects I'd like like

00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:56,050
stupid number of side projects at that

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,239
pride over the years but this is one is

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,330
somehow against the odds I was able to

00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:03,069
stick to for multiple years and I'm

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,289
still doing it and I think the reason is

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,989
when I schedule months of advance an

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,999
appointment to record the show line with

00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:11,800
the guests it's really awkward for me to

00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:14,529
bail on that and wake up one day and

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,679
just say not in the mood or too busy and

00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:19,050
so somehow I keep doing it I think this

00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:21,819
is talking a little bit about

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,059
strategically tricking myself into being

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,919
forced and honor a commitment and not

00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,769
just trying to fit things in when

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:33,329
they're convenient I also have learned a

00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:35,379
lot about the importance of quality

00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:39,699
balancing that would be importance of

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:42,639
shipping and I think at the end in the

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:45,519
end of the day perfectionism is a real

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,909
danger and that a lot of us are

00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,599
susceptible to and I'm no exception but

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:54,099
I have learned looking back there were a

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,689
lot of times we rented it I didn't put

00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,449
in that much effort when I'm goanna

00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:01,089
release stuff anyways and glad I put it

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,740
out there I I will get a lot of the

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,569
things that I've created as a movement I

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,209
could have done that so much better but

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,419
I have now learned to be at peace with

00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:13,310
the fact that except at least I released

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:16,340
it at least I published this

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,830
or at least I did it as opposed to not

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,139
because it wasn't good enough that would

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,889
have been much greater regret for us

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,180
sitting in that situation right now

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,909
those are just a few of the things that

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,400
I took away but one of the one of the

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,620
big big picture things is just compare

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,479
the difference between what I expected

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,930
to get hopes to get and what I actually

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,729
did from this experience I think I think

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,399
this is important to reflect on this one

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,820
day it was a show that we were when to

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,589
release to the world and maybe a lot of

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,779
people would watch this it would become

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,519
popular there were other shows we

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:56,000
probably we're going to be the next such

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,620
and such and it's gonna be neat you know

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,260
this is going to catapult us to

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,380
prominence in this community well not

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,140
really it did but I'm not bummed about

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,720
that even at all because I got in the

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,190
end some things that are better that are

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,010
better than that that are better than

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,990
just a lot of views on our videos down

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:19,180
below Center our field I got really

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,290
valuable relationships with people

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,670
simple approach so many people in

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,110
community and say you might just like

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,730
talking to me for a little while and

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,529
I've made a lot of friends in this

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,079
process I've got a lot of really great

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:33,980
advice from the best minds in the

00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:36,980
industry to very valuable contacts and

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,770
and it's just been really fun to hear

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,850
the stories only fascinating people in

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,279
this community is gonna be such a

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,839
greater appreciation and the diversity

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,660
of this group and the varied backgrounds

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,260
and everyone has has been really fun to

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,430
experience now I'm going to talk a

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,730
little bit about some of my reflections

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,170
on the makeup of this community which I

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,420
should preface by saying

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:07,579
first and foremost that the makeup of

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,790
this group the people that I have made

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:16,250
ru reflects my network and my network

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:19,519
reflects me and I have fit a profile I'm

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:22,040
uh I'm uh I'm white 30-something male

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,410
for middle America in the Midwest for

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,930
Michigan and I never kind of reflects

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,269
that profile a lot of context in my

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,850
geographical region and a lot of people

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,680
who fits and more profile to me like

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,480
attending the same types of events and

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,690
going to the same types of parties and

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,459
interested in the same topics and so my

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,440
network is generally lacking in the

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:47,089
diversity that maybe it could have

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:51,820
though something at work on but even so

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:54,170
I do think there are some useful

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,230
observations to make from this network

00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,339
and it is a large network when compared

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,320
to the global community is quite small

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,829
so we're going to we're going to just

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,480
look take it for what it's worth

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:12,220
first of all I want to talk a little bit

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,660
about the age of the WordPress industry

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,730
so this this market is building young

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,980
the WordPress space has not been around

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,250
for a really long time they're all have

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,100
a lot of ways a lot of symptoms along

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,670
ways that we can breed into this like

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,760
you know for example a large percentage

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,350
of the people in this industry are

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,620
southern point there are a huge number

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,720
of very small micro businesses making up

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,080
this industry still and this is

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,810
gradually changing

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,160
time almost every industry follow the

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:53,220
same trajectory as it is a very yummy

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,250
industry every single one is highly

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,520
fragmented and that means like all all

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,620
the players are small and many of them

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,050
are doing essentially the same thing as

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,150
each other a lot of different small

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,540
players gradually as the market begins

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,690
to grow and mature you see some bigger

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,460
players begin to grow and then it

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,980
continues to go in that trajectory where

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,650
the market itself becomes more

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,870
consolidated so here think I'm like very

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,150
old extremely well established

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,050
industries you will see them as being

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,810
very different than this where like the

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,970
old established industries like the auto

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,180
industry or the banking industry would

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,170
see virtually no self-employment and all

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,910
employment is a very established

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,920
industry with only a handful of players

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,470
makes it extremely difficult for new

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,870
beliefs to enter the market because the

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,660
established players are so entrenched

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,270
and have so many more resources where

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,670
press is still young but he is maturing

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,280
so we are starting to see a lot of the

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,080
companies in this space begin to grow

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,970
and we're seeing companies that have

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,910
hundreds and very single seed companies

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,140
that have thousands of employees and

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,870
gradually as easier goes by it's a

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,030
little more difficult for new brand new

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,280
small players to come in and like really

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,230
disrupt things and offer something that

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,260
hasn't been done that becomes a little

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,570
more difficult as time

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,960
but we see companies begin to acquire

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,670
smaller businesses and merge and small

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,140
players who may compete go out of

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,840
business and before you know it there

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,660
are a few fewer businesses in the market

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,820
and this is something that I want Sarah

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,500
doctor you know getting to know a lot of

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,000
the people in this industry and watching

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,160
them change jobs and so forth they've

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,540
definitely still a significant gender

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,620
gap there is in all sectors of techne

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,960
WordPress is no exception

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,020
I had they were repeatedly told by

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,510
people by women that I've talked to you

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,490
on the show it's for them to tell me and

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,640
not not for me really to relay but I've

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,890
just been told that anecdotally that

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,830
like wear dresses is pretty good

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,020
compared to a lot of other tech sectors

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,090
and that's really all I have to say

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,280
about that this is the makeup of the

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,730
guests that I have my show on my show

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:20,410
I've done I've worked pretty hard to

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:24,820
diversify this as much like you yeah

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:27,760
that's that's really makeup the Bureau

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,780
of Labor Statistics said that last year

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,090
the national turnover rate was about 18

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,270
percent 18 percent of people like in any

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:40,240
sector ended up changing jobs in the

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:43,840
year and so it wasn't too surprising to

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,890
me that in our space is a much higher

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:53,140
number almost twice as many but I think

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:56,580
that that reflects the makeup of the

00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:02,200
type of industry it is is technology and

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,250
a little bit dominated by younger people

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,160
and

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,590
early stages or middle stages of their

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,060
career let's get a profile of people who

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,830
would do change jobs a little more

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,960
frequently and also the Marquis is a

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,310
little bit volatile still a lot of

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,530
changes are occurring so we're seeing

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,350
more and more like business acquisitions

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:26,550
every year so a lot of people are like

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:31,500
essentially changing their employers for

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:34,660
reasons like that and there's definitely

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,010
a spurious age gap on this this is a

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,410
little bit interesting but there's some

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,880
stuff to stuff to cover here

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:48,160
overwhelming majority of the people that

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:53,140
I have interacted with interviewing are

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,000
in their thirties for sure and pretty

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,490
small numbers and some of the other age

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,960
groups I think this is for a couple

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:08,740
reasons one is it is a reflection of my

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,900
network and the types of places I go and

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,530
things that I do and the people that I

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,839
have been meet so a lot of that types of

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,120
events that I attend and a lot of the

00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,430
types of after parties that I frequent

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,920
and a lot of the introductions that get

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,630
means to me are people finding of

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,550
fitting a similar profile to my stuff

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,440
like someone in their thirties and doing

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,490
similar things going to similar

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,209
activities so it's not surprising that I

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:40,389
is predominantly people in my age group

00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:42,790
but also like people who attend

00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,970
conferences is another factor as well

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:50,110
because I have found that people kind of

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:53,980
in this age group are the the group most

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,529
able to attend events frequently like

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,509
stewed they are not in their 20s or

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,639
teens they're old enough to have the

00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:03,040
means to travel a little bit and

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,350
actually go do things they're a little

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,380
bit establishing their careers maybe but

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,240
not quite so anchored down as people a

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,390
little bit older who find it more

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,279
difficult to get away and travel to

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,589
event so this is an age group that is

00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,649
most welcome representative conferences

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,339
just because they're most able to go and

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:27,730
enthusiastic about their way so this I

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,309
sing that to convey that this is not

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,880
really a reflection of the global

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,549
WordPress industry just a a make up of

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,520
people that I encounter mostly an event

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:40,340
because I almost never in my time guest

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,549
on my field

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,400
and person that's quite a common usually

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:49,429
for relationships and for conducting an

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,640
interview with somebody but at the same

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:59,059
time I do think that this pie is would

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,980
be similarly and reflected in the makeup

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:07,580
of a lot of the like established players

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:11,659
in this industry and that's for a couple

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:16,630
reasons one the WordPress thing itself

00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:21,049
is a little bit too new to be really

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:26,419
infiltrating more established markets

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:28,250
and industries because this is decently

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,880
well established but it is still a

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,309
fairly new and evolving technology

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,130
hasn't been around for decades and so

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:39,289
like enterprise level businesses and the

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,090
corporate world is not even paying

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:44,419
attention to WordPress currently at all

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,029
but it's also bold in the sense that

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,610
it's not the hot new thing that the kids

00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:52,809
are doing WordPress is has been around

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,399
for a while American newer more

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:57,370
attractive and exciting technologies

00:18:54,399 --> 00:19:02,110
popping up more recently and so it

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:05,470
doesn't surprise me that the age groups

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:08,110
are not well versed represented like the

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,419
younger generation younger than myself

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,049
and the older generation is kind of like

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,090
our generation who was young all of

00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,620
these people in their thirties were in

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,779
their twenties when they discovered

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,029
WordPress and it was like this new

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:24,759
exploding thing and then it was like a

00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,889
fertile market where the demand was so

00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,749
much higher than the supply for services

00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:30,369
and products and if you made something

00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:31,960
that was even a piece of junk people

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,389
wouldn't buy it

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,129
that was an exciting time to be getting

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,960
into WordPress and riding that wave and

00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:39,399
a lot of the people right now reading

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,879
the successful brands and WordPress that

00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:45,399
you recognize came in at the right time

00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:47,019
we're like in their 20s experimenting

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:49,059
the new stuff reading the blog you're

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,899
not going to make a plug-in and boom the

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,159
next thing you know they've got a

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,110
business on their hands they didn't

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:58,379
expect it's a common story that I

00:19:53,110 --> 00:20:02,350
encountered also not too surprising the

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:05,289
the global community is huge the u.s.

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,440
does not make up a majority of the

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:10,809
WordPress community at all but the other

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,210
non press communities are not very well

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,980
represented both in my own personal

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,909
network

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,190
but also I would argue in the WordPress

00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:21,899
community overall the u.s. is happily

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,529
emphasized and gets really kind of

00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:27,570
quality on the attention you know a lot

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,850
of those other communities are big are

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,190
thriving but really do not get a whole

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,570
lot of recognition something that I

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,279
wouldn't work out personally in my own

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,600
small way and is something that I think

00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,409
that we need the whole WordPress

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:43,470
community to do better I'm trying to do

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:46,789
my best to this is fun to map all people

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,559
I just I just love the fact that I'm

00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:54,240
developing a network of people all over

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,100
the place and anywhere I go every one of

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,929
these blue pins represents like somebody

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,330
that I would probably hit up and say hey

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,380
let's hang out I mean your town

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,230
virtually everywhere in the country

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,549
that's that's really fun for me my way

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,010
around this would be surprising that

00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,380
most of the people are like that Center

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,080
in Michigan that I was able to

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:18,179
communicate with now just a few things

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,519
that I I took away pretty frequently as

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,860
I look back cuz I spend a lot of time

00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,909
just thinking about when I forward a lot

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,019
from the people that I've interviewed

00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:30,450
and one of the things that I grew up

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,610
were in all over was how they got into

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,390
this by accident does anybody feel this

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,730
way like I use WordPress and they like

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,700
this is by accident yep if you hadn't

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,190
been you probably do feel that way

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,040
because it's not like established and

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,950
old enough that anybody was getting into

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,490
it deliberately you're planning to dive

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,870
into this that can be happening now it's

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,500
conceivable that there are people right

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,270
now like figuring things out and saying

00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,290
you know that WordPress market looks

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,450
really exciting

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,400
I want to deliberately pursue that and

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,530
the skills necessary that's possible but

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,550
it wasn't that were poorly especially

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:11,650
for the people who have been trained

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,820
professionally for what I the majority

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,880
of the people that I talk to have some

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,700
college experience a lot of it was

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,430
completely unrelated and many people

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,070
that I can do had very unrelated career

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,540
so it was a very recurring theme that I

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,430
would talk to somebody ask them their

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,080
story and they're succeeding of

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,090
WordPress right now running an agency or

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,880
at the business or something like that

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,640
and then like I used to be a an airplane

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,040
pilot for our firefighter or I was in

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,420
the military or all these different

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,890
things and then somehow I don't know

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,320
everybody this has a different story

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,590
like accidentally the stumbled upon this

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,270
technology found it easy and fun and and

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,810
before you know that they were making

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,980
websites for their their nieces business

00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,980
and the bakery down the street

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:05,260
I heard kind of commonly that a lot

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,960
especially especially the people who

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,610
have been doing this a long time a lot

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,650
of people when I asked like oh so what

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,030
events are you going - oh well I'm kind

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,570
of like he's a magnet of travels a

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,720
little while and this I interpret often

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:22,750
for a couple of reasons one a lot of

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,190
people that I talked to have been doing

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,230
this

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,570
and when the wordpress has been an

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:33,570
exploding and like the 2009 10 11 12

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,460
years is really blowing up then like

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,970
were kids were kind of mutant popping up

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,990
all over the place and a lot of these

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,960
bringing businesses were finding

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,070
unprecedented except success and growing

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,020
and a lot of people were just like

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,970
diving in and going to every work in

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,160
they could and just like contributing to

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,900
the WordPress project and just on fire

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,350
with it and kind of went a little hop

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,120
too much too fast and got burned out for

00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,220
a while so a lot of people who imagined

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,790
that their experience now like they're

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,900
over gives every single weekend and it's

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,940
just overload but also I think it

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,820
reflects kind of an age group as well

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,790
where a lot of the people who like in

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,450
2010 we're going to ever work in now

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,850
we're like in their late 30s and have

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,000
kids and a home and find it much more

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:27,600
difficult to get out and attend every

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,460
event that they like to and virtually

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,100
everyone was self-taught there's almost

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,860
no one that I parked it was very rare to

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,630
hear that I studied you know web design

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,970
and development in college nobody said

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,070
that everybody learned this kind of on

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,650
they're all learning tutorials of

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,830
whatnot online building to go see these

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:50,580
sites and learning HTML with in my space

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,350
days and so on and this should be

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,500
something for you know reflect on it

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,850
you're not someone who has frequented a

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,940
lot of work days maybe if this is your

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,680
first time I heard over and over again a

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,680
lot of people said something to the

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,650
effect of

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,140
their first work in being a big turning

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,270
point that was a very special moment

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,330
that changed the trajectory of their

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,460
careers that's something to reflect on a

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,640
little bit like what happened for them

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,550
the people that they met their eyes were

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,490
open to how welcoming and supportive and

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,200
huge this community actually is and the

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,430
fact that whatever problems you're going

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,050
through there are other people here

00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,390
going through the same problems and

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:37,810
that's really important for a lot of

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:40,750
people now less time into just a little

00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:45,820
bit about the valuable lessons I've

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,500
taken away from the stories of the

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,690
people who are really successful that

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,850
that I interpret as having been

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,520
successful I started something that is a

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,620
sustainable business went from nothing

00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,360
to growing something that's big that's

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,660
well recognized in the industry like

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,170
those success stories what did they have

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,450
in common let's start with what they

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,150
said what I heard over and over from

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,550
them when I said you know like how did

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,080
you get here and you pulled this off

00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,420
finish to build something from nothing

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,770
that it really works that people pay you

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,960
for people said over and over and over

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,670
specialization is a broken record and by

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,710
side for installment it'll be a

00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,870
jack-of-all-trades generalists are

00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,640
really hard to market you want to be

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:34,240
able to charge a lot of money if you

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,070
want to really be less vulnerable to

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,220
disruptions in the market and have job

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,830
security the way to do it is to be super

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,690
good at something just provide an

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:48,620
exceptional thing that's narrow a lot of

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,020
people said that

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,900
or over and over than raising prices is

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,840
super important and that all of us

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,240
charge too little with almost no

00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,840
exception and that's kind of a problem

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,240
that the WordPress economy has faced for

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,180
years that almost everything is like

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,330
underpriced and a lot of professionals

00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,680
compared to like not WordPress space and

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,770
we're like it's we're to go and pay for

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,740
this plugin in like the sharepoint of

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:22,480
Magento space it would be so much more

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:26,030
money so much more when WordPress is $19

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,100
and that's ridiculous and a whole lot of

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,590
the professional developers are sailing

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,230
I think it paints so much more if I'm

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,270
working in like non WordPress so why

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,860
would I work at WordPress where people

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:40,370
are just not willing to pay very much

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,650
money it's this plate the WordPress base

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:47,830
for years and we're still kind of

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:50,390
struggling with that like I said before

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:54,920
perfectionism is dangerous and a lot of

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:57,920
the people that I heard who have been

00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,830
successful said repeatedly that is just

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,160
important to release a stuff and not

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,440
just iterate indefinitely until some day

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,720
is perfect and ready to go find that

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:14,270
time way too late way to it knowing when

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,630
to give up is an important lesson that I

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,850
learned from just so many people have

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,740
moved on from things when it was time

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,470
and that's one of the characteristics I

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,050
have observed from the people that I

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:31,370
think are the most wise and and

00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:35,510
experienced and we've got some of the

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:39,050
biggest things they did not wanting

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,870
leave persist a like forever and

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,840
something that

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,520
working they you have to understand

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,620
what's happening in the market and when

00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,990
to sell something off and just be done

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,240
with it or when to just quit something

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,340
and move on to another project but when

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,279
said like totally reinvent their product

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,380
and do things differently these are some

00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,900
of the people who have had the most

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:05,700
success they knew when it was time to

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,960
move on instead of just like always the

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,450
thing is like I used to run a business

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,789
too and I know what it feels like to

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:16,710
always feel like in you're so close

00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:18,000
you're just you can see the line to the

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,190
end of the tunnel and it's right there

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,779
and you can if you just try a little

00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,529
harder just keep on a little more than

00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:28,169
get there except you may not you bet

00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,230
that the vision never goes away no

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:33,690
matter what happens in the business and

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,159
a lot of us are you know kind of put on

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,840
blinders and just follow that light

00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:42,149
until it's a little bit too late I heard

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,130
over and over when I asked questions

00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:46,590
about you know what are some of the

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,630
problems you had to overcome the

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,120
challenges you've had with hiring and

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,830
employees and bad clients and projects

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,549
that didn't go well

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,870
I heard essentially like my

00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:59,549
interpretation of the advice that I

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,350
could offer at Oakridge like it all

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,760
comes down to communicating like

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,370
communicating to the clients upfront

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,539
more about their expectations that will

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,460
solve a lot of problems down the road

00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,950
communicating expectations with

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,230
employees and then assume now that the

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,379
indicating what wasn't working like

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,330
basically all those problems that are

00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:20,549
painful and awkward that we encountered

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,690
in our businesses are essentially saw

00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:25,440
the via that they might be better

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:28,320
communication this community will really

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,649
help you if you let it and I heard this

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:37,759
very much so many people said something

00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:37,759
that if you really want to go too far

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:45,480
yeah if you want to go fast go alone

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:47,820
when I go far go together like a African

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,230
proverb a lot of people say it's this is

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,470
super duper and I think that's totally

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,489
true so lean on this community and it

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,220
will help you

00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:57,779
almost everybody says I got as much or

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,299
more back from the community as I put

00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,440
into it

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:03,659
these are some of the things which are

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,879
more beyond our control these are things

00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:08,809
that people didn't say so much as what I

00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:11,700
interpreted and looking in their story

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:14,999
and I think this is the stuff that is

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,730
good to keep in mind when we fall into

00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:21,989
that trap of like comparing ourselves to

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:24,269
other people's stories some of them just

00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:26,279
got it at the right time unless you can

00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,419
do about that they were just doing the

00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,359
right thing at the right time for the

00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,519
right people and fortunately for them

00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,840
WordPress took off there are all these

00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,519
other people out there who make things

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,109
for other platforms that didn't take off

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,590
and they've forgotten about it and

00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:41,609
dropped it by WordPress did explode and

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,809
some of those people were there at the

00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:49,200
right time they capitalized on it all of

00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:51,330
them who were really successful had a

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,859
lot of stories of failure so this is

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,749
something really important to keep in

00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,280
mind if you look at somebody else who's

00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,860
similar

00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,720
you and you think that they're more

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,090
successful than you are and you're

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,130
scratching your head wondering why well

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,700
this is important to keep in mind all of

00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:09,590
those people that I look at they're

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,540
doing such great stuff right now they're

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,680
just rolling and their business is

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,390
soaring and they have made it if you

00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,370
listen to them tell their story they

00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,330
will go back to the times where they had

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,120
nothing

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:27,230
it was terrible they were at the bottom

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,750
and and they just everything was failing

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,960
and somehow they persisted then the

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:35,800
lesson eventually something worked I

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,080
worked again I called hip and Williamson

00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:43,790
he has he's made a few plugins over the

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,920
years a great total of like four of them

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:50,000
have never had any commercial success

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,910
and he's published probably more than 80

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,700
they're out in the wild being used by

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:59,540
people and those aren't necessarily

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:01,700
failure but it's a similar it's just a

00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,860
way to remind us that like not

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,600
everything you make is going to explode

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,920
and it's important so just keep trying

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,740
things there were a lot of people that I

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,750
talked to who are doing well a lot of

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,000
success and a lot of credit can be given

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,760
to the situation that they fortunately

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,950
found themselves in some had great

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,810
partners some kind of funding if they

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,450
write a little work with some has some

00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,610
kind of a financial cushion which meant

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,320
they could invest in this project that's

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,530
Bernie no money for an extended period

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,550
of time and still be okay a lot of us

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,520
never

00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,290
cells in that situation and so we don't

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,190
have the opportunity to maybe build an

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:46,580
equivalent project that's too bad some

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,930
people have had that privilege and and

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,030
made the most of it

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,220
so that's just another thing to keep in

00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:56,300
mind great partnerships are really

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:59,330
important very consistently and almost

00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,030
all of them can be traced back to days

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,510
like today where good relationships were

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,880
formed and in-person events and and of

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,880
course all of these people just really

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,980
work their butts off you know staying up

00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,710
late working on the weekend sacrificing

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,910
a lot of their social experience that

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:22,190
was a very recurring theme now just to

00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,679
wrap up I want to go over a few of my

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:30,650
favorite points that I just think our

00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:33,560
worth an encore the strategies that I've

00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:36,770
used to trick myself into being

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,929
consistent or really good like sniffing

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,030
a like a lifetime with a guest that is

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,070
too uncomfortable for me to just cancel

00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,220
because I'm not in the mood that works

00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,720
really well for me so I think we need to

00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,000
learn a little more about ourselves and

00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,409
applying creative strategies of trigger

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,349
into consistency what hasn't worked in

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:01,410
the past in WordPress is it always going

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:03,240
to continue working equally well so it's

00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,349
not going to be an effective strategy

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,839
for us to just model our plan after what

00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:11,040
other people have done like I work on a

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,750
product called easy digital downloads

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,510
which is a pretty well-established in

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,790
popular plugin and our business model

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,040
has evolved over the years and there are

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,320
a lot of younger smaller plugin

00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,750
companies who say things like you know

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,890
we're trying out this because you know

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:33,390
BBB used to do it or does do it and I'll

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:34,589
say no like we that worked at the time

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:37,440
it doesn't work anymore

00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:41,520
I recommend a different strategy that's

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,960
we're changing as well so just be aware

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,089
of the market changes I think all of us

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,660
need to chip in and help the diversity

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:53,579
efforts as I said before this community

00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,430
is really special this moment a period

00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,980
right now here this event is really

00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:02,099
really take advantage of I strongly

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:05,010
encourage you to get lunch wait other

00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,430
people here and and take the time to

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,740
talk with whoever you're next to these

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,420
home servers like really impactful I

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,270
can't race like so many of the great

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,089
experiences that I had and the positive

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,280
directions that my car is taken just to

00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,020
like days like today where I thought

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,820
talking to the right people and things

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:28,170
and never predicted ended up happening

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,660
they've had to be for itself if you're

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,490
not successful as you would like to be

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm sure the reason that is you just

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:39,960
haven't failed enough times keep at it

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:44,820
and get there and with this I think it's

00:36:39,960 --> 00:37:02,220
time for questions if anyone has any yes

00:36:44,820 --> 00:37:06,570
sir yeah okay good question so your

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:09,870
question was along the lines of wanting

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:12,090
tips for interviewing people especially

00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:15,030
in cases where maybe someone's difficult

00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:20,150
interview or just generally conducting

00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:23,580
an interview like for recorded programs

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:26,100
yeah yeah we're not talking about job

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,210
interviews sorry about gears in this

00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,770
chat

00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,180
okay I love this topic I didn't care

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,770
anything about it when I started the

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,300
show and now it's become a passion of

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,510
mine interviewing people is something

00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,040
that I just I love doing it and so much

00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:43,370
fun it's a skill that I want to continue

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,620
to develop and I have so much respect

00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,330
for like the people who conduct great

00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,340
interviews that I listen to like Terry

00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,180
Gross and Ira Glass and Joe Rogan and

00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,190
Marc Maron

00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,050
all those people would just like great

00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,640
shows and pull out the best stuff than

00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,250
their people it doesn't hurt that

00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,930
they'll get great people on their shows

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:05,090
and some privilege we might not always

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,800
have but still they have skills and are

00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,590
really going to just like extracting the

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,400
good stories and making making any

00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:21,740
interview worth watching listening to

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:23,660
you want some tips I think I've always

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,740
had more success when it was more

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:29,240
prepared there's no question about that

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,250
so the more homework I did about my

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,040
guests the better I was able to take a

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,680
conversation a good friend and maybe the

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,800
work conversation that had ended mates

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,440
in the show that was really good to it

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,590
like just chatting to them and then

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,890
before or just like signing lines would

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:52,210
be a technical system check before we go

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:56,190
live for the show and just small talk

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:58,790
the more I can learn about them

00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,710
and more likely I was able I would need

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,510
to go and successfully get a

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,940
conversation in a good direction and

00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,510
like co-op really interesting stories

00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,300
and find the kind of really compelling

00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,190
points in their story as otherwise that

00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,460
can be really difficult to consistently

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,930
do on the fly sometimes I'll have a

00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,060
guest you know if I ask it a question

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,339
it's a little bit too open-ended and

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,910
they go on a long spiel and I'm like

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:29,310
I've got six questions here but where do

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,869
I even take this from now that can be a

00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:35,339
difficult moment if you don't have a

00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:37,680
plan and you haven't already learned

00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,839
some of this information because it's

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,490
not that important for you to learn it

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,310
during the recording it should probably

00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:47,130
know a lot of it already

00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,930
not all guests are equal in terms of

00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,540
what they're going to give you and

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,310
definitely I've had guests who I asked

00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,099
maybe three questions in an hour

00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:58,710
commandos got lots of stick and I have

00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,589
other guests who give extremely short

00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:04,319
answers and I'm reaching and I'm giving

00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:07,140
me anything I know what that's like I'm

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,089
whole snacks but that's that's that's

00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,250
flying in my case because this is just a

00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:18,930
show about like who these people are but

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:20,819
no other objective my case as I said the

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,230
purpose is really than just get to get

00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:24,900
to know these people what they care

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:29,849
about what they're trying to do without

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,220
a real goal then I looked like a point

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:35,160
that we're trying to make in the end

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:38,260
that's different than live shows a lot

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,160
of shows there might be and

00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:44,410
here like this is a business strategy

00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,760
show and we're going to talk about how

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,680
to increase our monthly recurring

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,200
revenue and here we've got some of those

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,120
next round the top baking soda so it's

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,900
like you have an objective I can really

00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:58,300
guide you and all of your questions and

00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,150
run on that a lot of my guests I have

00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,010
found were much better if they have some

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,080
questions and they knew what was coming

00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,970
and I always appreciate that too because

00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,900
I've been interviewed a number of times

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:13,510
as well and the times where I knew a

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,660
little bit about what was coming I was

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,170
there I was a better guest and a better

00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,480
story

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,950
I think his stories are like some of the

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,480
best content but they're also like the

00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,760
hardest to come up with on the fly and

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,310
tell them well they used to teach job

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,530
interview skills with people and there

00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,990
are most like situational type questions

00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:34,480
tell me about a time when and those are

00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:37,030
some of the most valuable questions

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,270
something like the fastball down the

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:42,190
middle opportunity for us to score and

00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,070
illustrate like how people who we are

00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:48,610
and there's some of the hardest an

00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:52,720
answer on the fly because we have to not

00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:54,280
only process like and the computing

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,830
power like all our collective

00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:03,250
experiences to find one that fits that

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:05,800
is the question we also have to tell an

00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,480
immanent than a clear way so that

00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,500
there's a lot of whole progression to

00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,880
the story so I think sharing questions

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,320
in advance of your guesses are really

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,310
good strategy those are just a few tips

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,310
I think other questions

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:28,580
so what you said about power press sort

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,580
of is something best situation where

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,370
we're unable to sell and and sort of

00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:42,600
like accessories and even services for

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:45,180
as high as we are like various like

00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,650
SharePoint which was we're looking at

00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,280
hundreds or thousands of dollars or

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:52,050
something and then like if you take a

00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,070
look at other communities like the

00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,320
Drupal community

00:42:53,070 --> 00:43:00,090
you don't sell things like clothes like

00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:04,140
that but then we have WordPress which is

00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:06,420
sort of you know I mean those two and we

00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,480
have such a low barrier to entry for so

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,640
many people and so we're getting all

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:17,060
levels of people creating fun innocent

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:19,260
services so my wishes I agreed that

00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,920
we've kind of got into this mindset

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,050
where you're you know a lot of people

00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,640
that are even thinking pain technology

00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,190
or plumbing is too much and they're like

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,470
no idea of free one so where are our

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,110
services and products our values are

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:36,930
there's dirty and people find their

00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:41,160
value so low but what people are getting

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:45,090
is actually worth a lot of money so how

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,030
do how do you think that maybe we can

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:50,880
work towards solving that or or maybe

00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,869
trying to value our services and our our

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,910
offerings

00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:57,240
what they should be at we kind of

00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:01,920
changed that expectation of you know

00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:21,509
users and and customers thank you a

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:23,160
great question - good question it's this

00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:24,749
is definitely a challenge and one could

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,789
argue that it's not as big a problem as

00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:30,180
those of us property from the successful

00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:34,380
WordPress make it to be because it's

00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:36,299
really users to have like small business

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,849
owners attention weekend warriors and

00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:41,279
people trying to do something special to

00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:45,539
have an opportunity to make something

00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:47,069
like use investment that's that's the

00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:51,599
case with WordPress right now that is

00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:53,759
kind of cool that that opportunity but

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,999
at the same time that makes it really

00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:59,849
hard for legitimate businesses to be

00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:02,220
sustainable in this space and so what we

00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:04,950
have is this this problem that

00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,289
eventually breaks down we're in the

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,119
early days it's kind of fine because

00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:12,269
there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,839
that a lot of people are making and and

00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:19,680
much of this cheap and it's pretty

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,480
affordable to get started but a lot of

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,119
that stuff can't be well sustained

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,589
because and doesn't earn enough and so

00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,539
these these products are being sold like

00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:33,839
what once of not recurring or for low

00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:35,819
prices and whoever's behind the products

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,849
can't importunately wanna business on

00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,849
that

00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,519
doesn't matter like they eventually

00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,809
evade the product or maybe they look for

00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,640
resources to put in the product accent

00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:47,829
make it really good and so what we can

00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,079
see eventually it kind of breaks down

00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:52,059
because a lot of people are like on

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,529
either abandon technologies or

00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:57,220
technologies that were not developed

00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:59,019
very well we have quality issues and we

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,390
have like security issues and

00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:04,779
performance issues only slight problem

00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:07,390
because the those working in the

00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:10,990
industry making the freakin stuff could

00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:14,710
it really invest heavily it's making it

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,880
very much and there's nothing and it's

00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,099
not there not enough money falling

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,279
outside companies a little top talent

00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,799
and top resources to even have a dream

00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,690
of diving into the WordPress space I

00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:28,880
think that would make no sense to them

00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,259
why will be dumped into this space

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,329
you can honestly make amazing stuff

00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:34,430
we've got the best people on resources

00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:36,049
in the world but there's no return

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:39,079
America where we're at and also where

00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:56,420
eventually because here's the line we're

00:46:39,079 --> 00:47:09,950
kind of like indicating a lot of it's a

00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:14,809
better picture like why are you talking

00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:17,930
so really yeah thanks question is also

00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:20,440
like talk questions or like very second

00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,440
question

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,269
yeah well iteration of the data that was

00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:37,299
the question like where came up with all

00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:39,400
this stuff mostly I did it all myself

00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:41,049
and like a big spreadsheet and try to by

00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,809
calling us I've ever had and then like

00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:46,480
too late location and to be for college

00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:49,079
and what they recommend and they say for

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,180
this madness that is just super tedious

00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:55,650
so I just have this spreadsheet which I

00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,650
don't think is private I guess I could

00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:08,810
wait yeah okay this is gonna be the

00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:13,699
other great talking minute so what

00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,699
