Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Over the past five years, I’ve been running a weekly, one hour, live interview show featuring a new guest from the WordPress community every episode. During each interview I’ve attempted to get to know the guest, their interests, and their story. Along the way, I’ve learned a lot about the people who make up this community. In this session, I’d like to share hard data as well as some personal reflections I’ve gleaned from just listening to all the people who use and make WordPress.
