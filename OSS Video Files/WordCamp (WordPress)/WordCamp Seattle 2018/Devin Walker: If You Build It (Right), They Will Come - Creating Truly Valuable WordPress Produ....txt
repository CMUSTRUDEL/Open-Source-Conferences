Thus, it serves as an excellent springboard to launch new, exciting, and profitable solutions. Whether it be in themes, plugins, or services, there’s plenty of room for innovation and disruption.

given back extensively to the WordPress

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,590
[Applause]

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,549
I wrote that myself was kind of awkward

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,770
internet acquaintances people but yeah

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,479
that sums me up pretty well today I'll

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,689
be talking about if you build it right

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,159
there will come as you heard in the

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,039
drive have quite a bit of experience

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,429
building products from WordPress mainly

00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:44,090
plugins I first started with WordPress

00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:48,950
in 2009 and it's been a great journey

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,899
since then the platform grow and meeting

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,700
a lot of great folks along the way so

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:55,819
I'm going to share a little bit of that

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,630
insight here's a bit of what I'll be

00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:00,979
discussing why WordPress why it's a good

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,009
you know market for you to build your

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,799
product or service in my startup doing

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,380
quite a bit of services I worked at an

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,329
agency for two three years and then

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,340
stepped out on turbines freelance work

00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:15,380
on my own and I think that's really

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,010
common and then started out doing some

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:22,430
more you know client services before we

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,139
moved more into products so examples of

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,139
successful business if you take a look

00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,810
at and highlight a couple of plugins I

00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:32,600
don't know a couple of agencies from

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,750
more boutique agencies to a larger scale

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,079
ones and then building your business you

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,230
know how do you do that you go to

00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,220
bootstrap proud to party up our universe

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,590
full of manure

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,940
things like that and then finally than a

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,960
VP approach whether you're loving

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,630
or service or relatively small group so

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,060
you know be willing to you know if you

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,570
have a question home accessible you know

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,480
you can interrupt me so WordPress this

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,920
is kind of the graph that I've pulled do

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,960
they did but you can see they're all the

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,450
way at the right WordPress is the most

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,340
widely used content management system

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,100
out of all I'm not sure if you can see

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,760
this but Drupal is very small up there

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,010
on this Skype used by fewer sites you

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,960
can see WordPress is way up there on the

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,450
right-hand side on its own this is from

00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,040
the 10th of November so it's pretty

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,660
relevant statistic here you can also see

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,860
here this is our content management

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,110
usage worldwide on all the internet it's

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,760
work us on the right side of this peace

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,850
symbol looking things here that's

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,180
WordPress right there and then Drupal is

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,070
the green spot below that so there's

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,140
lots and lots of opportunity to build on

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,489
WordPress the other greatest other that

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,739
might be you know customized CMS that

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,440
may be an agency's putting clients on or

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,670
like in their whole application built

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,739
into a CMS something like that

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,320
so some more interesting statistics

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,310
about why WordPress is great and why you

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,930
know if you create a good plugin

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,720
and if you support it properly and

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,549
documented properly people will find it

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,470
on work best not work but plugin repo

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,710
has lots of great opportunities for you

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,650
on that 30 plus percent of the internet

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,950
runs on work best this I think might

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,300
have ticked up what percentage or two

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,870
within the last couple of weeks but I

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,840
saw that recently and I think when I

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,860
started it was around 20 to 22 percent

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,480
of the internet so there's tons of

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,760
websites that are running our workouts

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,430
that they estimated 80 to 100 million

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,200
sites run on WordPress lots and lots of

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,850
opportunity there 48 percent of

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,050
technologies top 100 blogs are

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:58,110
management work with WordPress wire.com

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,720
recently went back to WordPress after

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,560
moving away for a little bit and they

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,720
also wrote a blog piece about that and

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
they've got some good publicity a bleep

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,820
time Commons another really popular one

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,260
that Caesar and a lot of them are doing

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,450
really interesting things now with

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,260
WordPress REST API we are kind of using

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,540
WordPress and sort of like a headless

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,460
mode and you can really type the data

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,510
where you need to do where you need it

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,860
to go are you really flexible with that

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,100
56 language translation to WordPress

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,250
highly internationalized our plugin give

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,490
WP has been translated into 15 other

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,520
languages by volunteers

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,830
Prescott work the polyglots team and we

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,270
didn't have to do anything except to

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,449
make sure that all our streets were

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,139
properly internationalized for them and

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,490
it's it's helped us grow from just the

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,699
United States or english-speaking

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,490
countries to other countries like Israel

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,380
for example we've made sure that we have

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,259
right-to-left compatibility so when you

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,300
you know if you work press in the right

00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:07,430
to left mode that our plugin is

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,110
conformant that's so those types of

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,210
little tweaks really can make you go

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,400
into other markets and help you grow

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,979
your product or service whatever it

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,590
might be and then we're putting the most

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:22,280
popular with businesses and nonprofits

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:24,710
so we took a look at the space we did a

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,530
lot of research first to decide what we

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,680
wanted to do and we saw that 48% of

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,270
nonprofits are running on WordPress and

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,880
then we took a look at what solutions

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,849
were out there for accepting donations

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,220
managing donors getting reports on it

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,979
accepting recurring donations doing that

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,409
in a free of open-source way and there

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:49,520
wasn't much there was you know a couple

00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:51,169
plugins that did some ok forms and they

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,960
were updated every six month by one

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,350
individual so we kind of identified that

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,210
market and really

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,810
after it and there's lots more

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,700
opportunity to do that

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:06,480
59% of small businesses don't have a

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,090
website so if that means that you the

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,610
the weld is not dry yet there's

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,990
definitely really follow you can there's

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,260
going to be a whole lot of more

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,840
opportunity whatever your opinion on

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,150
Guttenberg is react is coming into work

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,640
best for you know there's not a lot of

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,830
developers or agencies that are really

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,920
doing WordPress in it that could be a

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,810
niche that somebody goes after and

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,300
there's a lot of other opportunities you

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,450
know WordPress is perfect for a small

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,280
business you know doesn't have a large

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:42,480
budget and they want they don't want to

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,410
pay a yearly license for let's say like

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,030
a proprietary CMS or a monthly fee

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,610
square pick space is really going after

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,160
this art but you know that's still kind

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,050
of do-it-yourself mode for like the solo

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,580
business person I mean I don't want to

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,440
take anything away from Squarespace it

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,630
serves its purpose but you know we're

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,000
here at work press conference so it's

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:08,520
definitely something that I got to get

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,020
WordPress and not on that one many

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,490
haven't when you will succeed in the

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,000
worth best market essentially that's

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,700
what the gist of that is you whether

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,010
you'd want to start out on your own or

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,620
you want to work with a big company you

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,050
can you can do that what you need to do

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,110
is really take a look at

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,180
this case right now easy digital

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,180
downloads is a product that I want to

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,029
highlight because Pittman Williamson is

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,849
the developer who started this he has a

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,250
number of different plugins that who is

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,729
selling before but this one really I

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:48,080
think was his big break he released it

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,750
around like 2010-2011 I had a chance to

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
really talk with him and kind of pick

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,060
his brand and they were in a mastermind

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,180
together for about a year and and I

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,570
learned so much from him and the way he

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,670
goes out in the community he writes a

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,100
really great blog post he runs his

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,170
company very transparently and he

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,260
doesn't you know put himself up in some

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:15,649
ivory tower where a lot of other you

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,990
know CEOs I guess you could call do

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:23,570
another types of industries especially

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:26,270
software so his product essentially took

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,680
the e-commerce space and install you

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,480
know some opportunity there and said

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,800
okay

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,630
do digital downloads very well and we

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,480
sell our art plugins through it

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,730
they have a software licensing extension

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,920
a bunch of other extensions and I really

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,120
like to have a free Corps that was

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,970
really well done on wordpress.org highly

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,790
rated and then sold extensions on top of

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:56,920
them it was a good ghost everybody know

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,639
who's running Yost on their sites I

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,500
think nearly everyone right I mean all

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,769
in one SEO is pretty good too but I got

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,959
to give just a nod for that because he's

00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,199
an example of also another person who's

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,199
highly accessible highly influential in

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:16,240
the WordPress space and the majority of

00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:18,399
his revenue I would say this is not

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,060
official to my speculation comes from

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:26,079
that premium version that it sells but

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,790
he also sells some services too so if

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,769
you're looking at the comparison

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,680
directly I would say that the services

00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:36,040
are a much smaller piece of the pie of

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,199
that you can do SEO audits on your site

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,980
and they do some training courses and

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:42,220
things like that

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,600
and and they also have partnerships with

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,550
other SEO type of companies they're

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,959
based in the Netherlands and they have a

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:55,990
thick around 50 plus employs enough

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,910
digits avi is a small agency in Los

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,160
Angeles and it was started by this

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,380
individual named Alex Vasquez and he

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,680
does very good work as a freelancer and

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,610
throughout the years he's grown into a

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,190
team of that

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,279
four or five people now and it's this is

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,740
a good example of how you do good and

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,019
you make really good name for yourself

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,089
you've passed bigger business about

00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:22,510
three months ago we move past them into

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:26,050
some client work I think he definitely

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,649
won RFP it was around twenty five kid

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:33,430
for that one RFP so he's pretty happy

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,950
with me at this at this time I didn't

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,200
pass it to him if I didn't know he did

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:44,649
good work and he was you know well-known

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:46,899
in the WordPress space skip private

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,480
oasis this is one individual in the

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,000
large County area named Dan Cameron and

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,230
he does the best invoicing plugin for

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,350
WordPress and he and I also talked for a

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,320
long time and and were part of just a

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,029
little networking group and in the

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,610
bosses opposite you know why don't you

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,050
grow past just yourself and it says you

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,180
know I'm really comfortable I'm doing it

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,360
on my head and he doesn't really want to

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,250
get you know to the next level on the

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,290
about page here he has a great

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,000
explanation about like hey it's just me

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,070
doing this but guess what like this is

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,829
all I do it's something I'm dedicated to

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,779
and he really likes that you can focus

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:29,440
on this on a day-to-day basis help the

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,149
customers and then also have a great

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,579
time with his family I did that you know

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,709
off times as well so it's really about

00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:39,940
you know how do you define your success

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:41,760
in business just yourself like Dan or

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,550
you could be a small number of folks

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,709
like Alex or you can do a really large

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,180
company and again this is not going to

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,300
happen overnight and you have to work

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,900
really hard of it but look at what's you

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,620
know happen to

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,930
WP engine for example when I started in

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,470
WordPress they I remember their first

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,200
website our old logo and and the hosting

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,550
was kind of really fast but it was like

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,070
breaking but and now it's like a very

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:17,360
300 plus people maybe 2 more than that

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:21,440
large funding huge office and in Austin

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,350
and and you know a really well

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,380
recognized host and so that is something

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,270
that you can definitely do I mean it's

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,330
to take hard work but how do you define

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,990
that success and I would say no no your

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:39,500
why nobody you're trying to do this

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,870
what are your end goals but start with

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,730
you know maybe a bite size like a year

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,380
from now and then three years from now

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,230
and these are gonna change and things

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,279
change door opens door closes as time

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,140
goes along but things will work out if

00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:58,029
you start with the wife who is familiar

00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:01,790
with Simon Singh X book start with what

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:04,040
yeah perfect that's a great book and now

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,800
said it does several others there's no

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,930
one call them leaders eat last which is

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,610
a really informative book but most

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,170
people don't start with this wine that's

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,150
kind of small for you simile be in the

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,150
back of it a lot of people start with

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,810
what first with Gibby really wanted to

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,150
make it easy for anyone to set up

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:26,720
funding for their cause without having

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,210
to make payments to a staff platform to

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,100
take it to centers there

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,920
so we came up with a model more than

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,930
democratized generosity kind of a nod to

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,940
WordPress their mottos democratizing

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,060
publishing we want to do the same thing

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,040
with online donations so how we did that

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,779
you know various development efforts

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,630
design efforts I'll show you a little

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:49,180
bit of that bigger and then to what

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,070
of course the product in the heavens and

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:57,700
this we'd support in the documentation

00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:01,750
after that we set a lot of goals early

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:06,730
on we set financial goals we set product

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:11,800
development goals we set high goals but

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:14,260
what we did is we set SMART goals that's

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,260
how people heard SMART goals okay

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,020
perfect there's a lot of great Google's

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,880
spread our Google if you google SMART

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:28,690
goals there's some nice tools and that

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,920
will help ease both but essentially

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,470
they're specific measurable achievable

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,510
relevant and time-bound enough with a

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,000
pie-in-the-sky type of things like I

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,420
want to make the next WP engine and have

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,910
300 million in revenue and by three

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,880
years from now that's like not a SMART

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,260
goal at all but if you choke it down and

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,959
make it fit into this timeline that is

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,300
actually more relevant than you can

00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,209
definitely start seeing that success on

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:02,980
a daily basis weekly basis and so on

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,260
so first you decide what you want to

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,640
sell whether you're selling services

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,930
there's lots of opportunity there

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,630
development design maintenance security

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,570
security was a great example

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,110
a successful business that really

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,730
started with focusing on WordPress kind

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,810
of like they're an hour and move all

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,240
options and now they that web that his

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:33,070
firewall and their recently acquired by

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,340
GoDaddy and and they made a great mark

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:39,310
in the space they're consulting

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,830
optimization and support when I first

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,980
started the WordPress there was no there

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,050
were many sites like WPS I care or WP

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,090
buff offering like monthly maintenance

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,150
and support plans will keep your site's

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,690
updated you know will make sure they're

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,880
backed up on a daily basis Union little

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,310
extra hand will do that nothing like

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,960
that and you know there is an

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,870
opportunity there people saw and no

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,530
success center a successful venture for

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:11,520
a lot of folks another example of that

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,540
on the services side whether the

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,480
consulting like they're kind of micro

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,490
consulting if you need a custom widget

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,310
in your sidebar you can go and you can

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,680
pay somebody like codable for example

00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,740
for that I think it used to be called

00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,470
like TWiki or something like that but

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,160
they've recently changed things but and

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,770
then also themes plugins of course

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,990
themes everybody's you know heard of

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,120
Envato theme for us but there's so many

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,640
great other theme companies outside that

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,910
Divi is one of the most popular themes

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,860
and massively trafficked website I see

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,450
their ads on YouTube all the time

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,990
they're really well done

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,570
and great people over there plugins

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,640
that's the space we're in SAS software

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,440
as a service they're seeing this more

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,230
and more as well people building

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,510
services around maybe reporting or

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:09,670
metrics for WooCommerce or some other

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:12,040
form of integration into WordPress Co

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,710
schedule is another example of assassins

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,570
well delve into work best for managing

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,340
your content and scheduling it and all

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,950
sorts of social media integrations on

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,810
top of that that's a really interesting

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,060
marketplace because you can kind of

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,250
control your code more but a lot of it

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,120
depends on your server side skills as

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,920
well keeping things up to date you can

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,440
sort of tribe more of a monthly fee for

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,130
the sass space to where to plug in this

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,100
work of an annual payment tools and

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,700
hosting those are pretty

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,350
self-explanatory but flanking each I've

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,690
been saying that quite a bit you know I

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,460
think that's given several examples of

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,310
ones that have been highly successful

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,320
but there's plenty out there I really

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,600
like the you know the kind of the react

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,130
to play coming in and you know and I

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,320
think we're going to see a lot more of

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,040
that taking over the WordPress admin

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,390
interface

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,030
the front ended here in the next future

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:15,280
next year next couple years after 5.0

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,900
rolls out so what's your idea you got to

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,970
figure out try to be at first and really

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,260
you know kind of sell yourself on it

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:26,080
first this come from a standpoint that

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:30,220
you already already know about so for

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,100
instance the way that give was thought

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,880
of was we were building lots and lots of

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,530
nonprofit websites and we were using all

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,590
sorts of tools to accept donations

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,200
nearly in the clients more than one

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,050
client only came back to us I said well

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,450
we don't need a cart system for the

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,730
donations it's just awkward for them to

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,620
go into a cart and then go to and set

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,020
their checkout pitch like they're buying

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,900
a product and oh by the way why does it

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,540
say product here and then why do I have

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,190
a quantity for my determination so like

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,840
we've got the name your price at all we

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,010
put it in with farmers we've got that to

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,810
work but they still weren't happy

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,150
they're like then they move to the admin

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,340
interface and they said okay now this

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,020
products here in all reports based on

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,750
e-commerce they want something really

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,980
custom in the admin interface that was

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,390
built just for donations and donors so

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,120
we're like hey you know this could

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,650
really be an opportunity here for

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,200
something big you know we know there's a

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,950
market out there for this we've seen it

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,830
just from our own client experience and

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,580
and then by the way 48% of nonprofits

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,659
use work

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:44,350
so we didn't let it just you know sit in

00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:48,070
our own private conversations we went

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,659
and we validated many work camps so the

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,390
first discussion was out the last word

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,890
cancer at Cisco in 2014 and we spent

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,200
about three or four months after that

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,510
just kind of tossing that ear around to

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,600
a couple folks that we know and trust

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,820
and value their feedback all too many

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,799
times I see a lot of people like oh I

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,779
have granted you like can you sign this

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:13,000
name da first or something like that and

00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,830
sure but you know how good is that in da

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,110
ville' rhythm what I mean this idea

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,419
better be really awesome for me to do

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,340
that in words but the best is just to go

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,139
pitch I mean there's like a great little

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,809
speaker area you're not trying to sell

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:29,440
anybody and it's like oh you're gonna

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:32,159
like it or not I have a great body in

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,080
India his name's Minogue I'm David he's

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,389
he's done a lot of great projects and

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,149
he's like God he's known for about of

00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:41,380
engine WP found mostly but he just

00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,649
recently came out with a new product

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,389
called WP merge I know and he's really

00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:48,850
trying to solve the murder problem with

00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,130
with databases on various sites within

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,080
the WordPress but he pitched that to me

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,389
like several times and iterating on it

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,340
before was like a bed of knob works

00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:59,230
really well and Wow it surprised me

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,429
actually did kind of solve that Parmalee

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,519
well but you know you'll have like

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:09,549
buddies that you can really always trust

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:12,940
them and get these ideas and and

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:14,169
validate that so it's important to

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,039
express that functionality

00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:19,960
well no before before you build it I'm a

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,230
big fan of functional specs coupled with

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,430
wireframes and

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,770
it's a little small over here I want to

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,410
just show you briefly a couple of

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,380
functional specs I put together for a

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,210
couple hours to be released so this

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,400
starts with like a Google Doc here's an

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,950
example of an add-on forgive that we've

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,810
created and it's called feeder cow great

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,400
smell like what speed recovery well we

00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,900
have a line there look ask your owners

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,080
to come routine we're processing fees

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,280
that's like the pitch right then we go

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,060
into like okay what's the official

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,070
plug-in name was the texted a wireframes

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,630
brief documentation here about it and

00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,400
this really lets you kind of hotshot

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,410
your idea and then when you go to write

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,150
the marketing for the marketing content

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,840
for it you can kind of pick it from here

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:09,750
as well kind of goes into more of the

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,490
pitch here about why those donors would

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,120
like it and then a bit about how some

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,250
milestone setups

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,870
like getting the global settings and

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,990
perform settings working front-end work

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:25,140
plugin activation checks object oriented

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,120
class gesture and then the different

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,700
options for it and then we get into some

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,520
more visuals here okay here's like an

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,350
animal shelter example and then I put

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,269
this together really quickly

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,610
I'll cover the transaction fees so this

00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:41,130
is a checkbox version but if I'm going

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,830
happen maybe I want to force my donors

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,960
to do that so we have an option to do it

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,519
so this one doesn't have a checkbox and

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,159
this is a gift fridge and you can see

00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,559
that we wanted the the feed to update

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,549
right right there instantly when you're

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,019
changing the mouse another one I want to

00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:59,789
briefly go over is called currency

00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,070
switcheroo okay what's now it's pretty

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,740
evident in the name but provide your

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,120
donors the ability to pass their are

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,940
given the currency of their choice

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,179
excuse me I'm get a couple examples how

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,509
it works and and then we comment a lot

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,100
on it so a lot of these go to the

00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,289
development team go to somebody else we

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,389
share the Google Doc around and then

00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,029
there's always like wireframe attached

00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:26,639
so I created this wireframe and balsamic

00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,470
and there's a couple other tools out

00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:31,019
there someone's pretty good for basic

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,299
wireframes but it shows you sort of

00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,429
about how the admin interface works here

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,710
you know the sticky notes and things

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,330
like that and then here's goes to the

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,960
front-end and describe that

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,340
functionality further another one for a

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,919
different project that's called WP

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,570
business reviews and you can see this is

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,970
much more to more than a wireframe it's

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,649
more like a concept but this one's more

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,899
interactive I pre-positioned know

00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:57,419
envision app and you can see it has

00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:59,279
these hotspots here and this kind of

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,019
simulates okay if I were to like average

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,899
view what's that screen gonna look like

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,539
not going to have a review screen okay

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,059
let me go to collection and see what

00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,609
that looks like I know

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:13,070
my platforms here go back to our Lea's

00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:15,049
here and then let's click on this one no

00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,019
this is an actual review that's been

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:20,570
written and you know it gives you a much

00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:22,820
more visual representation of what the

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,529
actual product looks like when you're

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,059
pitching it it's not just words coming

00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,099
out in their mouth it's like people

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,749
looking at pretty screens in there like

00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:35,419
that a lot better

00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:38,090
I mean how these supposed people to go

00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:40,419
back to my presentation area see you

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,440
express that idea before you build it

00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:46,070
efficient have I just mentioned that

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,599
it's well integrated with my preferred

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,399
design toolkit which it is sketch I was

00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,249
using Photoshop for a long long long

00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:58,129
time but I've recently switched to

00:25:55,249 --> 00:26:00,169
sketch rich envision that also

00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:01,039
integrates with Photoshop but I'm just a

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,469
big fan of sketchy

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,519
it's matter only but they have this

00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:08,149
great tool show you in a second here let

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,789
me just do it

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,929
it's called sketch press inspire friends

00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:15,919
stand up there out there

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:18,409
it's a whole screen of on the admin

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,690
interfaces symbols and icons and it also

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,619
has Gutenberg screens and makes it

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,049
really really easy to design magnet

00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,859
interfaces using the component libraries

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,940
and things like that

00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:35,450
within sketch it's on github you can

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,919
easily check it out and contribute to it

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,830
if you want as well and they're keeping

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,119
it up today the wireframe image was my

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,239
choice

00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,299
I like balsamic through quicken and easy

00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:49,639
things things like 89 bucks ten bucks

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,679
something like that and arcs your

00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:52,400
believe that's how you pronounce it this

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,460
is a sandy

00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,040
company and it's much more complex and

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,270
interactive they also have a wordpress

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,790
toolkit that you plug in and make this

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:09,410
interactive wireframes whether there is

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:11,150
a much deeper learning curve so once

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,520
you've done all that it's time to get

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:16,760
started building the actual product

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,450
phpstorm it is my preferred how do you

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:24,800
need I use this on a primary basis but I

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:27,920
also use vs code Visual Studio code it's

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,309
a great lightweight editor it's a little

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,030
more setup and customized according to

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:36,890
your liking but whereas phpstorm kind of

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,520
has WordPress tools built in out of the

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,470
box if you're not a developer and you

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,380
need help you can get the help you need

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,050
to succeed I mean it might cost some

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,510
money to get it done but if Irina's

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:54,290
harder and hiring quality developers is

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,860
difficult if you're an agency this is a

00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:00,530
great site for coaching online training

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:05,240
that's from here indirect and it has a

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:08,809
lot of great online resources from going

00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,080
from that one person to you know growing

00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,910

wireframes in your functional specs all

00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:49,610
the way through development so they're

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,440
full-service like that if you don't have

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,120
maybe the development skills at a design

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,100
skills on your own there's other

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,809

developers quality designers Facebook

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:09,320
work best groups diminutive members of

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,090

going on in there and don't be afraid to

00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,260
post a question as long as it's you know

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,940
not something you can easily Google

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:44,899
local WordPress engage be meetups have

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,899
been really great in ten year ago we run

00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,730
remember be nuts and also I have worked

00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,310
as a work

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,170
that's connected me with a lot of folks

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,250
I've been wanting to make it up here to

00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,980
where camps you know for quite a bit

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,530
this is my first one the super stoked

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,480
it's really great up here but work games

00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,850
like this one that sponsor hang out over

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,970
there is awesome just got around and

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,310
doing the sponsor to track also going to

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,790
the speaker you know area and just

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:16,540
making my kind of you know networking

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:18,040
rounds dribble comm is awesome if you

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,590
can get an invite on there or you can

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,990
just brews like freelancers I think it's

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,590
really affordable like 20 bucks a year

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:29,200
or a month and you can stop that see to

00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:33,400
those quality designers Envato studio i

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,650
think that recently changed names but be

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,970
careful on there some you know just

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,170
depends you have to do your homework and

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,760
then if you need to learn to code you

00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,120
want to do it yourself there's so many

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,550
resources now this is 71 of the best

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,460
places to learn to code for free i think

00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:54,880
google have some courses out there this

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,860
learn to code without me and it has lots

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,160
of great resources on there for you as

00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,160
well

00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,850
once you decide all you know what you're

00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,970
going to put your need to brandon with

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,070
it too I'm really proud of our give logo

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,290
and how we iterate it through that

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,779
process and I'll show you a little bit

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,269
about that I'm not really

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:19,629
designer but this is my first attempt at

00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:23,289
the give logo here you can see we have a

00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:24,940
leaf past the eye and that was like I

00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:27,009
was like I do want to leave in there at

00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,719
some point because like giving in the

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:31,960
trees all sorts of things like that

00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:33,849
feels good vibes and then so we kind of

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,320
went around with some hearts and some

00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:40,450
more playing tax it was the hand and my

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,340
pulling the heart something strange like

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:47,769
that lowercase letters gonna fit my vibe

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,349
but we did like the green on that so it

00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:52,539
kind of took the green from this and

00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:56,289
leaves from the other one and then we

00:31:52,539 --> 00:32:00,849
came up with version 3 and so this is

00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:03,309
similar to their logo now but I'll show

00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:08,559
you the next screen this guy looks like

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:10,739
a bike helmet more than us leave me but

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,039
it's getting there you know like the

00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:18,729
eyes kind of working its way in the vena

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,200
loopiness not much shading but we knew

00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:22,089
we have something on this but he just

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,849
needed to kind of like patch it up quite

00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:27,999
a bit so after a couple more iterations

00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:30,759
we went through tossed it around us

00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:32,679
people with their life gotta we came up

00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,030
with this logo I'm really happy with the

00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,980
way this turned out

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,680
somebody actually came up in their life

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,050
this is the eye a person holding their

00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,910
hand into the jiyoung's like no but I

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,120
can see that now it's pretty honest and

00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:49,490
Ashley my main objective was getting the

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:54,380
delete in the G correct and then the

00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,910
shading and the nice soft green color so

00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,620
that's kind of the process we went

00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:03,290
through I we hired this out to an

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,000
individual I found out dribble and I've

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,340
looked for quite some time

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,160
on are able to come up with this guy and

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,630
he was very well you know he was up in

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,120
Orange County weren't saying he arrived

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,310
intervention and very communicative and

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,230
willing to work through us with that

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,060
iterative process and we're gonna

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,400
popular the way it turned out

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,950
and that's the only work he's ever done

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,290
for us that's it and there's just like

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,680
three or four years ago and since then

00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,990
we've build a great company around it so

00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,970
it right on that design for a successful

00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,640
granny get feedback like I was saying

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,710
friends mentors advisors and then pay

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,600
close attention to that detail you know

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:48,220
any type of pixelation I thought it

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,220
really matters especially like

00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,179
minimal about running so we got some

00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,039
branding along once you're building it

00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:58,919
what you're gonna do is you don't want

00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,110
to build the whole thing right away like

00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,269
you definitely don't want to start with

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,210
a wheel with your ideas like a Maserati

00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:09,210
or something like that like a little

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,760
steep work you know and then and then

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,169
move forward and iterate on each of the

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,940
steps along the way

00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:19,290
first version of get we did release with

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,970
recurring donations and we from them

00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,520
what we learned from the market they

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:27,599
wanted it extremely bad so we spent like

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,000
months making the best first version of

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,490
MVP for kind of missions that we could

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,349
and since then we have iterated upon it

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:37,349
I wouldn't say we're at that carnival

00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:40,589
yet I'm no photography there but we're

00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:42,629
getting closer to that Folkestone simple

00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:45,690
implementation your project start with

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:49,230
that minimal set of features and then

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:51,990
release the survey and always get that

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,389
feedback from your users validated

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,700
products all problems does your son that

00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:00,740
pong the initial problem doesn't have to

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:03,660
solve all them question everything

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,990
taking the account the Ottawa now versus

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,220
later and then

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:10,809
of course iterate on everything just

00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,420
remember you can always do it it's

00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:15,400
nothing to always be easy after you

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,020
launch the product you know you might

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,180
get some bad feedback don't let that

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:22,480
discourage you there might be some one

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:25,420
star reviews on work best on work that

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,069
makes you kind of cringe but the most

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,470
part if you support your products while

00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:31,720
you have a good documentation you'll

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,309
succeed it and wordpress.org is a great

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,619
market where if you build it really

00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:38,770
writing it and well they will come they

00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:41,079
will find it do you have to market it I

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,650
mean going to work very much here this

00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,640
is after you build it and you

00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,309
successfully launch it

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,630
they will start coming look at it my

00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:53,050
name is Devon Walker you find me on

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:55,839
Twitter I haven't heard webs and also

00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,450
our Facebook advance work Pat's give WP
