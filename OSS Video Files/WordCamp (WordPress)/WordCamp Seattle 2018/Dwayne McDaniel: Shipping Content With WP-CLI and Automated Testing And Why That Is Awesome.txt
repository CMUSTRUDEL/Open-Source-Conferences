Title: Dwayne McDaniel: Shipping Content With WP-CLI and Automated Testing And Why That Is Awesome
Publication date: 2020-04-11
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	We live in a world of continuous integration, continuous delivery, version controlled code and configuration. Yet when it comes to delivering content we are relying on doing all publishing straight to the production environment and hoping it works, editing the live document to fix issues we only find once they are in production. I propose there is a better way.
Let’s build our content on our development instances the same way we develop code and configuration. Then using the power of Github, WP-CLI and Automated Testing tools like Behat, let’s professionally deploy our content to production will full confidence it works as intended. Let’s give editors better tools to build better content in a word of Gutenberg while saving anyone the need to overwrite the production database ever again.
Topics include:
WP-CLI for generating content
Connecting Github and your WordPress site
Leveraging multiple environments
Behaviorally testing content

get right to marked out with acne test

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,630
as published wordpress blog and lessons

get back to that a second

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,810
I enjoy a lot of things I definitely

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,530
don't have comic books or karaoke

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,380
Twitter is my preferred medium just like

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,270
Bridgette over here I really appreciate

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,360
people following or tweet at me

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,270
it makes your previous project all the

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,740
toxic to compare with me for a second

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,979
should we take a picture reading a

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,840
portrait mode standard fortunate me in

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,759
front of this picture and tweeted at me

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,130
I would greatly appreciate this is my

00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:50,130
inception project 20 so far is the point

00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,439
all right the program now

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,560
all right so

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,750
Pantheon we have a booth out there to

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,300
talk about automated scale and doing

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,740
things a professional way to making the

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,060
very expandable and a library of large

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,040
numbers with equal peanuts what we're

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,700
about we're gonna talk to you about all

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:53,860
of those things

00:02:18,700 --> 00:03:06,690
Automation who do writes content on a

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:08,890
regular basis all right

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:14,950
anything business owner or anything else

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:18,130
that is in that list so I had sold this

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,430
as talked about should be content with

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,310
the WPC lot and that's true it's very

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,890
much the heart of what I'm doing but let

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,660
me show you exactly what we're going

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,280
through and it's light over the courtesy

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,780
with Brad lights in here this is a

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,340
YouTube video again you can find all my

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,930
slides online and watch this later in

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,660
time in the future I don't know

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,680
all Rumble are consuming a calm adult

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,210
America for it

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,240
and ever school

00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,530
post it now and I computed files or I

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,870
can just have to grab it straight from a

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,620
github account for a sinkhole on the

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,560
docks to be the permalink give it a

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,970
picture name the picture of a vault text

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,790
from the picture actually fails moving

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,650
alt tags are all tensed I tagged it and

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,210
then I'm a fishing boat from there it's

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,780
sped up a little bit especially at one

00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,950
point early in but there I have just

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,750
successfully built that content to my

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,820
defects were seen there was a backstop

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,310
up next I'm sorry we have there's some

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,810
pre capable testing to see if it broke

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,230
when I remove that now I'm sure you have

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,700
content over to my test environment

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,990
shouldn't live that now I'm worried

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,090
something called backstop which I'm

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,980
working pixel-by-pixel the testifiers

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,530
have the governor inside the same site

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,760
it's the same site as backstop so he

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,620
isn't here I do have an angle stuff

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,860
there as I do a lot of testing with it

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,370
and I want to push all of my tests

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:55,750
- so there's building to the lack of

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:58,030
Merit watch them anytime soon especially

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,950
go to the actual site and there it is

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,310
that's this thing they just created from

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,080
text file on my desktop and if you're a

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,880
normal person or never seen this before

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,980
you're probably thinking what the heck

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,890
just happened I came in here to talk

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:16,250
about movie content around you got

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,980
anything this week this song you just

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,550
saw we take content that it really

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,040
didn't matter the text editor pumping a

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,750
little bit of data around it and push to

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,960
develop environment then test that

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,850
behavior of the content when it got

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,590
loaded into the dollar bar see if it

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,640
broke

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,260
how many people have ever published

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,900
something didn't realize twitter did in

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,660
the world because you did a slight girl

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:46,490
yeah are that your YouTube video did not

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,560
work yeah things happen all the time so

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,840
then if that works then I push it to my

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,000
staging mark or my test environment in

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,770
this case and I test it again to see

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,050
pixel pixels at the same site on depth

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,220
didn't creep up on transport it might be

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,210
think the same between these

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,500
environments and if it is what that

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,050
means it's probably gonna we're gonna

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,940
push it to another environment and then

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,940
I'll show you pride and pride is nerve

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:14,710
well actually Louis for you can go to

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,710
see that National Post when I see one

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,050
comic-con wall person actually named

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,050
this pop by the way

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,889
she was but he said on my point zero two

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,260
percent of users and I don't think it's

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,100
wrong

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,250
why would I build something like this

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,220
ultimately because I'm kind of lazy and

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,680
then that sounds very counterintuitive

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,570
but I read blog and she laid out now

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,190
all right Papa travels you wanna see

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,860
where I do it all the word camps like

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,610
those who can do 30 events this year

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,900
some blood and maintain the blog

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,919
requires you will launch a little things

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,550
a lot none of them are favorable none of

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:01,520
them were uncool and heard

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,430
unsurmountable looks like an edible

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,970
paper cuts like who really likes going

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:12,350
in and selecting each one's issues yeah

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,630
and then like maintaining this stuff in

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,990
your time well for me taking I won't say

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:22,100
I didn't bunch of already I said I just

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:27,350
apply that good thing to my website this

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:29,690
is a good birthday now there's a lot of

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,789
us that's and then we'll talk about some

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,350
of those pluses but there's a little one

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,950
- that I wanted to sidestep and I'll

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,200
come back to that a little later so I

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,450
had set of goals we funnel only a lazy

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,690
person who doesn't spend all my time

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,419
building posts and like mainly testing

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,860
things and I do anything so I said okay

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,200
what I actually care about anyway

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,900
actually honestly care about fresh time

00:07:51,200 --> 00:08:04,160
get great wherever I wonder if I want

00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:06,410
airplanes a lot this is Google Docs does

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:11,990
not work on airplanes off of offline

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:17,330
loot kind of does but ever do sublime

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:19,160
text text which was actually use a lot

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,770
that this is the blog post already right

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,750
now about the event

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:28,780
at MoMA just works I personally think

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:33,089
the end that is really slow and if I can

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,560
avoid longer than the wp-admin I knew

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,849
for most things this is beautiful for

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,849
most things you can do things like

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,630
Leila's hair oh that does a couple

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:49,180
commands against a series of websites

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,760
that I maintain it shows me oh here I'm

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,350
up to date on this website and there's

00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:00,550
means that's up today that I'm gonna

00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:03,100
jump in there just a lot faster but

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,350
moving data around moving content which

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:11,649
is an exceptionally cruel thing WPC I

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,350
can actually do gets pretty complex and

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,610
if you just manually are doing this

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,089
you're actually going to be more work

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,480
than just logging into the admin and

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:23,350
just doing if there are so I found out

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,180
when I first found out that denry

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,700
pc-like could shift content around I

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,959
started playing and the essence actually

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,850
Harvey has a real post you can go

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,050
copy-paste this it won't work for you

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,030
because you don't have to

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,440
but actually probably would work if you

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:40,120
want to access to the safety so that let

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,450
me believe that I'm going to do all this

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,040
stuff

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,270
I should prototypes actually make

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,750
something out of I should build a tool

00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:52,330
but I can't further extend asking for a

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,800
little babies case and I can reuse it

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,660
over and over and over again so instead

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,240
of handwriting some people is this crazy

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,130
I can just tell it currently do this and

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,260
if you small tax all piece of tax hard

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,140
to make less mistakes bane of my

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,380
existence is posting something and then

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,320
realizing the day later that it's been

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,710
wrong since I possibly and there are

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,400
some things that break when do them like

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,960
Twitter and YouTube biggest ones and I

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,220
don't know you got some room I machine

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,570
just looking for every possible error

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,220
now I would see what blog site I'm

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,190
looking at one post at a time I can't

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,330
imagine any an every single post if I

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:40,660
was like working with a lot of people so

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,790
that's in the back of my mind as well so

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,340
these are my basic goals all right the

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,830
text editor might even Google burgers

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:52,360
fine content editor Ali it's a great

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,340
tech center I'll get to that number all

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,230
I'm gonna do again than ever again I

00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,970
things like automate things I think it

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,940
starting came through command line makes

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,500
tools I can use extend and share I mean

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,920
listen Stace so when I ended up building

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,070
this no worry this looks like a giant

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,560
pile of Legos I'll remove it and make

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:16,180
this a lot more sense what I discovered

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,580
in the process is that yes it did check

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:24,310
pollinators but labels you build

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:28,600
anything and WordPress it's amazingly

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:31,390
powerful tool that helps in this giant

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,510
pile of Legos do amazing things but it's

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,270
one technology among hundreds

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,840
technologies

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,420
your daily life making life better it's

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,640
a second piece for what is WordPress it

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,170
is very core see us content analysis in

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,670
the title it tells you what it literally

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,790
is it's not designed initially

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:59,400
conceptually to be decided to seeing us

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:03,950
we've extended it to do those things but

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,950
as we seem to come friends take hold and

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:12,990
experience that WordPress is role this

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,690
becomes all super critical to what we're

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,070
building next and I firmly believe this

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,660
this is why we're going to being such a

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,220
large part of the lens not because we're

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,140
he had more websites because we're a

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,550
more rich interactive web experiences

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,980
through things that we can't imagine

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,600
right now and that's two years it's how

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,980
fast technology changes is going to

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,260
probably come up with new experiences

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,010
there's BR out there right now it's fun

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,690
games with most bets nest and we're

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,360
precedents are very Pro overall that if

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,800
we embrace it as part of the gears as

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,780
part of the system's

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,230
that's not one thing you spend all your

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,310
time learning about just WordPress

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,170
you're missing the bigger picture and

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,170
that's what this experience for the top

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,950
and I don't think for you to kind of

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,540
show me both graphically and go from

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,820
that is the way to do everything

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,390
hopefully you'll see well I didn't know

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:11,010
that existed

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:12,720
Wow and my thing to my opinions one of

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,400
the things I firmly believe in rejection

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,610
we mentioned earlier in your talk is I

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,480
work on super hyper transportable it

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,610
works everywhere

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,580
reddit uses now give up music Martin

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,470
down that's for up like a laundry list

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,680
of other websites basically wants you to

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,110
write down super hair is horrible and

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,560
it's waiting faster so I can break

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,740
things in the left that turned out like

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,760
Baron or 800 on that each one is one

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,900
hashtag on to h2 is two hashtags

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,670
Omega link it's it's open close square

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,700
bracket followed by parentheses and

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,070
that's the texts that only need is that

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,080
something that's that quick so this blog

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,320
post that I'm writing right now as I'm

00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,020
at the event

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,260
like that's going to wear that top lives

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,910
on on the site in there is not a person

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:15,870
who you talking here for making this

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:18,510
stuff a lot of Turkey on and then that

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,700
they go Goomer Goomer can do things you

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,590
see somewhere on you are else and it

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,930
knows what that wrong URL is it will

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:28,830
just turn into a block that's very

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,260
manageable like I just fed up a line

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,970
into most text editors it's going to sit

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,530
there's a line of text but I repeat that

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,420
scene URL the Gutenberg's I wanted to do

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,920
this you want to clutter blocks is

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,560
Twitter brick

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,770
good and these two things work together

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,530
very beautifully because as not always

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:50,070
upstaging pretty came here this favorite

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,570
part about all of home bird is the back

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,060
you can copy paste into it and

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,490
we'll take whatever you're a seeing as

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,779
how it's supposed to be paste meaning

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,110
you can post in work now

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,250
even mention mark not my date or posting

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,550
right now because transformers

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,100
moderate-plus that other cool ability of

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,750
links just transform and I'm not worried

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,060
about how to code block I'm worried

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:16,110
about giving the baby to RL to treat

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:19,529
that I will expose calm piece of manual

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,529
and again I'm trying to avoid logging in

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:24,329
and using an editor that cop basement

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,449
not what we should do

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,860
so getting fun Little Italy's here

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:31,579
doesn't sound like bad but I swear

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,579
that's why I do this

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,790
that exactly three good content anywhere

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,959
in the world move it to any other place

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:43,709
in the world I am person the levels WPC

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:46,589
life it isn't amazing every time you

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:48,010
soul in it so powerful new script with

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,080
it

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,720
but uh one of the things we do that I

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,330
don't know whether seeing us seal

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,630
communal I've ever seen us ain't no EPC

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,570
I can do this let you actually create an

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,450
intuitive content director that's

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,000
extremely powerful feature which means I

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,510
can create content put somewhere and

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
then have the CMS itself correctly build

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,380
it into another environment which means

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,900
they never accidentally blow up a

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,550
database ever again because a tool that

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,990
was meant to do the job did the job on

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,510
the way that it was meant to be done by

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,130
the WordPress way it didn't accidentally

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,540
touch the database I was supposed to I

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,880
didn't accidentally wipe out a table and

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,260
drop all my users that they put on the

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,260
sequel's I'm really bad right now

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,850
I was in peace Eli on my server choice

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,840
my choice

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,910
Stephanie banned young because my life

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,320
turns out that it actually solves a

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,490
whole set of problems when everyone's

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,460
doing all this we're going to try and

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,140
clean up around the rest API and it

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,060
turns out the properties and risk API

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,720
the new content regulation around the

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,890
world is authentication makes sense you

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,560
thought that if you can't do a thing

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,560
it's not quite in the REST API how to

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,810
month indicate properly yet you build

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,550
your house but that's not what I'm to do

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,200
turn this little side stuff that since I

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,020
was authenticating to my serve to my

00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,210
host I could just piggyback on that

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,420
authentication to do all the stuff from

00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:20,980
the database in from the install that I

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,540
wanted to using this manner and we're

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,210
not quite there would even work as far

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,640
as the safety of transformer laundry so

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,680
if I copy paste and goes to the editing

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,050
experience copy paste it knows what to

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,120
do it was like alright let's do this cap

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,850
basement me I'm good if you just tell me

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,310
burg here's data shove it in through the

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,310
API it's like well I guess you wanted to

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:44,200
display the trend is it was sure what

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,590
will happen soon something in a jet pack

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,040
in WT markdown where I solved you can go

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,560
in your editing function

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,580
but if you got jet pack work it does

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,570
install this and you want the

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,060
lightweight version of all this it will

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,710
do something called transform rate which

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,720
means you show them data and it's like

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,740
oh I know what to do with this you show

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,780
you the data that you want me to

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:11,450
transform it's a special and hooking

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:13,280
there that it runs that means this which

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,850
is pretty much a text file that I

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:24,860
shouldn't be you because this when I

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:28,160
push so that's just plain text this I

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,240
store it came up that I get everything

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,250
worked out you give me which is

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,560
everything HTML can give me this

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:37,670
markdown is just ultimately a shortcut

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:41,570
taystee know who like training attacks I

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:45,650
can't read attacked yeah I kind of do

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,690
too would slow its wasteful like ready

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,970
and then forgetting to close the tank

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,890
okay I need yelling at me anymore than

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:56,990
it means to you that seems really error

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,700
okay like there's a lot of little pieces

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,920
now like I'm ready over here and I'm

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,020
pushing over here I hope it works right

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,850
and I'm not learning the visual

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,070
experience so I can't see the WYSIWYG

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:12,860
side of it I'm losing that Wow

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:17,330
we had a speaking of sizing thing I hear

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,340
you there's our behalf oh yes actually

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,060
the simple ones written for business

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:28,490
user it says let me write a test and

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:30,140
playing over and I mean great one that

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,600
doesn't say English and give me the

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,640
result back in plain English there's an

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,650
extension for called word have that less

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,920
it word press like that that you don't

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,390
have to write almost a drop a PHP

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,850
actually an immersion area but my test I

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,320
don't write page me I'm just filling in

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,270
blanks

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,370
pilobolus offer recipes combining

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,550
ingredients in the world of them that's

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,870
how I write test this one

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,740
this is actually what we can test

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,140
something like this is the actual

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,320
feature to put a test inside we have a

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,690
tall tall future and then in the

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,810
scenario block so I is a special word

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,310
that saying these easier scenario I'm

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,500
searching for out to Twitter let's give

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:12,840
it an eye on the homepage and I file a

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,790
bookmark which is an ID or one specific

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,660
section that will say follow that which

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,030
in the latest post

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,890
I should not ever see slash twitter.com

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:26,280
because that means I didn't unfurled

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:30,320
tweet this all the complicated ready to

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,670
be accessed action is like I am a person

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,550
given this information when I do this

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,460
this you have and this world this

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:41,730
happens I should see this pretty fast

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,660
break this stuff so I'm slowly over time

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:49,710
adding word or more features to my

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:53,010
awkward as I go as I see things because

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,210
it means that I can not just test what I

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,460
originally thought it was in the test

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,460
but over time improve based on the

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,080
errors of seeing and eventually test for

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,310
everything that could go wrong with my

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,290
sake totally at the time then they

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,780
backstop the other half of my satsanghs

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,430
rated society so being able testing is

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,640
awesome for testing to see that on the

00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,710
world would not backstop says pixel

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,770
pixel are these two things the same

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:24,660
thing doing this by hand really sucks

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:27,120
because we're error-prone in beans eyes

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,790
the attachment and this works really

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,160
well on large sites to like you know 30

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:35,250
pages you've update something are you

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,610
really gonna check all 30 pages oh my

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,530
god

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,630
but what the CSS gets a little screwy

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,460
and now we got this blocker

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,779
funky it used

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,159
this will be tell you a really fast pace

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:51,500
isn't the same thing and show you purple

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,029
where it's happening and it solves this

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,559
problem that worked here and it'll work

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,529
over there how many people ever push

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,960
will be from a little to a server and

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,289
who's ever they go yeah that's how local

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,149
development markets work okay there are

00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:08,299
ways to improve that but that's that's

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:11,090
the nature of East so that's why are you

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,799
lying to Devon sir because my dad sure

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,539
is the exact same environment as the

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,450
season series exact same environment as

00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,909
my live admire because these things

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,070
happen and this last one is the one that

00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:25,039
concerns me the most where everyone

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:30,590
walks out thinking about Newberg with

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:33,200
this in mind the whole point of where we

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,720
got to up till now in the CMS world is

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,049
separating the concern of configuration

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,149
or content itself we shouldn't have to

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,740
worry that my configuration is going to

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:43,690
blow up because I changed a bit of

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,270
content

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,070
Gobert for all pluses or minuses of it

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,899
as we introduce the concept of married

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,510
you go to configuration specific content

00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:54,950
and let me put configuration specific

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,049
content inside the configuration

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,929
specific content helping this block

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,960
didn't use the check it's extremely

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:05,419
possible you can build columns like BEC

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,190
that do various cool things literally

00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:13,220
dragging and dropping you've better the

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,039
configuration don't mess up that's where

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,080
the testing comes in why doesn't work if

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,149
it works here it works here and notice

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,289
we're going here but it worked here some

00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,610
reason we shouldn't over configuration

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:29,330
screwed up what about things I'm doing

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:32,659
this on 40 small I said and then

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,720
ultimately what I discovered what this

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:37,419
talk really is Mexican and that caramel

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,720
action set

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:43,690
the generals on the batch who here uses

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,789
it uses the command line another issue

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:50,570
yes you're gonna pop the other people

00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:53,029
open up your travels go go get get bash

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:57,159
or install get on your team I'm gonna

00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:59,899
get batch the bash bourne-again shell

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,159
super super super powerful unless you

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:07,309
things like this wait that's my work

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:10,460
lets me do things like this all a list

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,379
but uh I'm gonna go self Oh what's

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,710
mother like background I see someone

00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:20,059
agrees hot smoke or on fire right now

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:22,220
what city isn't that doesn't scene is it

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:27,529
must be do things ranking make scripts

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:30,679
and rank really complex ideas that work

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,059
about a lot of once I process and

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,240
oppressive the pot you can write new

00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:38,149
scripts to do fun things and matter to

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,090
this how many people have found

00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:43,009
themselves clicking the same buttons in

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,619
the same order multiple times to fix a

00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:47,269
problem and we're going to everything

00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,789
should go up that's not a problem

00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:52,909
you like I do this no this no this

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:55,690
this and it takes five minutes and you

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:59,330
do it one times a month

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:02,210
turns out WPC Li you can write a script

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,330
another scripts have another machine one

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,609
that scripted certain intervals crying

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,769
out and night number one interact

00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:12,940
Bushman's once again you will work

00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:15,919
upfront and it just doesn't operate

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,289
makes the robot seem to work robots

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:23,499
really really good it means super

00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:28,099
complex things I can't make this

00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:30,979
dinosaur I can five mater by having a

00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:44,809
formula printer by me for me and insane

00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:46,279
dinosaur billion times the draft but I'm

00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:49,309
going to have to manually look at nature

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,090
or only published I don't wanna make

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:57,289
sure I'm gonna have to make sure that so

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,749
much of the stuff happens by manually

00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:02,869
looking at I think times more body doing

00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:06,289
that I just wanted to write the content

00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:09,259
writer write it shove it somewhere let

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,919
somebody else test it for me show it

00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,809
somewhere else

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,989
let somebody else test it for me and

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:17,830
then leave to me human being to make

00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,369
decision if I push that back in there

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:24,129
looking rebels

00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:27,679
that's exactly what I set out to do it

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:29,509
all those verses all good projects

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,009
should share your knowledge and this is

00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:33,529
a minute again you can use this for beta

00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:35,509
I'm going to stop you up and go get

00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:39,999
posting now right now it's in the slides

00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,999
up in the slide section of my pro se

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,749
absolute locals were calling a component

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,470
central because why Falcon doing this

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:49,999
was not just that I wrote one utility

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,759
but it the certain point like we they

00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:54,049
I'm going to be the same

00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,269
senator a function that doesn't as far

00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:58,340
as extract Li that puts on a tool that I

00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:00,080
can use the credits of the project so if

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,590
you're using Pantheon there's a tourist

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,179
wpm content and arriviste

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,610
term it's dark mail interfaces and yeah

00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:10,129
where I can simply move content from

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,210
point A to point B from the site to that

00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:15,409
site for this environment to that

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,360
environment very simply by typing a

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,159
family it's all for me including the

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,259
metadata including the pictures

00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,090
including the photo by every everything

00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:26,870
it's like verbatim

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:29,000
no that's us babies interactive us both

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,070
information it means I could be on

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,139
e-commerce sake be taking a hundred

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:39,850
workers a minute and still build new

00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:43,299
post in a sane way ultimately again

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,649
Christus logged in and i wrote to live

00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:48,289
things more come on production say all

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:49,789
the time and unless somebody told me to

00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,889
just like the state of it gonna pop a

00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:54,830
mint it's gotta be a better way that's

00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:57,919
why i you see alive cause all my blog

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,779
comes into my site now it's a long way

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,059
as I'm sure I'm gonna make mistakes

00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,880
I'll ever see you lives I see a lie yeah

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,260
yeah

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:16,660
[Music]

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:17,200
okay pull the shorter talk and this is

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,090
what I mean

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,850
and I'll have a conversation to you and

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:28,000
it's a short talk or it's not that I'm

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:29,950
sure sure you know one happy and

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,429
pleasant silence absolutely

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:37,480
Cheryl and she but why you do the things

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:39,040
you do with wait because this might be

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,360
completely wrong for you you're gonna go

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,710
to s crazy amount of work again I'm

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,240
gonna point two percent of users once

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,420
your two percent users it's promised

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:50,490
right so that's what I'm getting out of

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,490
the conversation with you here thanks

00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,559
and bye

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,710
[Music]

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:27,830
so we had is behavioral testing which

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:29,990
means that's a it's written to the snake

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:35,990
called Kirkuk the Girton language which

00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:42,070
is their little Gertrud hurting it looks

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:46,270
like it's made specifically to be

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:50,600
English principal business logic English

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:52,610
as appreciate for and I'm doing

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,130
something that is very trivial like I'm

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,280
looking for us to be he's text on a lot

00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:03,770
and seeing did it happen

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:07,160
I also behave in men so when I look at

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,110
this page and fill in this form this you

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,830
know this should be displayed

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:15,080
I should taken to this page you could

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,590
write this for any scenario in three

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,900
months which means you can break super

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:26,060
big Suites of tests that will happen

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:27,260
literally every time you push code in

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,150
particular people talk this morning

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,880
about this particular subject of

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,400
automating testing says it really really

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,200
succinctly as developer I will spend my

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,510
time solving important problems

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,240
intertwining to alert from my automation

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,590
systems of what a fix to make sure I

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,230
don't have to go be able to fix those

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,300
things that's paraphrase that's

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,390
basically it I already solved with one

00:30:50,300 --> 00:31:00,419
problems fund a place like the tool I

00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:05,530
vote for uh how are you

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:08,590
yes this is my little buggy most evilest

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:12,100
against the most excites I hope it's

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,540
really just a matter of days ago but I

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,080
was a people did stuff like this make my

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:21,250
life even easier even better more

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:33,970
scalable didn't like testing to see if I

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:36,610
click the button did a thing or both

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:39,130
with your puller let's say a set point

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,900
we will replace all work three manatee

00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,520
through automation when happens we'll

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,200
get back to doing whatever we're doing

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,200
before they post work

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:14,010
okay Ross all problems oh hi so as a

00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:16,620
developer why do you feel that crochets

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,500
your kind of outlet do you feel like

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:22,260
that's a more tangible product of your

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,140
time can you talk a little bit about how

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:33,570
you have other habits that are

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:35,460
marketable or downtime is receive your

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,230
craft little time so now you have time

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,030
to be doing something else that makes

00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,340
you feel satisfied so I thought maybe

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:48,720
you could address that yes as a semi

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:50,580
mental health issue because go back to

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,169
the area this goes away for and still be

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:57,990
aware but that's the point so again I

00:32:55,169 --> 00:33:00,480
can say a lot because this is all I

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:05,760
don't have to worry about how my

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:10,140
websites and why I appreciate

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,200
specifically smaller penguins were

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,360
really good for the brain it really as

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,230
far as in therapy

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,440
I'm like meditating I can't get past the

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:27,179
point that I'm just sitting there but I

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,580
have some personal thing but yeah that

00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,899
free time to do

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,450
spending two to three hours a week

00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:33,380
chasing bugs on stuff that I'm like

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,690
breaking my hand

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,690
robots pretty good and we'll fix a big

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:50,710
robot behind you all right uh-huh

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:50,710
okay back to your programs

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,470
[Applause]
