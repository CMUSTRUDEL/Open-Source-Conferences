pleasure to be here with you this is an

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,090
introduction to Gutenberg future of

00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,450
editing there's some good for talks

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,350
coming at you guys later today

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,990
storytelling and blogging the boutique

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,310
uber let's go and then I think the

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,140
couple after my talks are going to dig

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,000
into more the development organizers a

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:38,730
good idea the first image is dig into an

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,110
introduction for those of you yet and

00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,220
you have a little bit that you want to

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,870
understand a little bit more about

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,640
picture what's going on

00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,710
so for a Catholic presentations gonna

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,120
just be an introduction talk a little

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,460
bit about what loop or data is how it's

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,100
different from what there is now what it

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,890
really means and the impact of it and

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,720
then I'm gonna talk about how do you all

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,480
think about the memories to talk about

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,760
it with your customers your freelancer

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,520
or agency or just have to think about it

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,920
yourself as you manage your own site

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,390
let's not write in wool first you can

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,850
get the slides if you want to all along

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,480
there's lots of screenshots and things

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,780
so I've got a bitly there gutten press

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,300
if you want to follow along there so I'm

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,010
ready so good and bird it's important to

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,530
think about when you start thinking

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,660
about Gutenberg you don't forget that

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,730
yes that this isn't an iteration this

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,670
isn't a small update this is a

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,530
transformation this is a brand new way

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,540
of building and editing content in

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,100
WordPress both under there technically

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,140
speaking how the editor is built and how

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,970
function is account delivers content and

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,830
mirrors back in the front end as well as

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,580
the UI this is going to be a big impact

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,959
on users it works like revolution right

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,820
they've been thrown around as far as

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,810
what this update means for WordPress one

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,700
of these we're headed into writing

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,830
content and both building pages and

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,050
building sites let's take a really quick

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,640
look at visually what we're talking

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,810
about here so this is the classic editor

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,660
international be really familiar with

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,370
this you've got one big blob of content

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,390
and the terminology I really like this

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,980
is blobs to blocks a lot of strategy

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,580
term that's been thrown around her right

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,900
now

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,310
but that's really dull topically the one

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:25,459
of the big changes is we're moving from

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,350
a so plastic better you guys are all

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,209
familiar with you got one big blob of

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,620
content the classic editor and that's

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,450
right Lister was right and it outputs

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,100
everything into the content of a post or

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,660
a page everybody should be really

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,510
familiar with this super simple circuit

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,980
board in a good bird world moving the

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,080
blocks of content we've got a title

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,340
block we've got a paragraph block

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
der graaf block and you can have all

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,600
sorts of different blocks but we're

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,400
moving to a more modular or visual or

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,170
block based editor and on the surface

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,120
this feels nice straightforward which is

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,600
good that's how it should feel on the

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,980
front end

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,950
same type of thing your blocks get

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,340
outputting

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,930
in the top 10 on your poster page there

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,400
are tons and tons and tons of blocks

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,750
there in the ship with the first version

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,920
of this for those of you who have

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,300
already installed a good different

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,819
plugin you've seen a lot of these blocks

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,620
as recently as two days ago blocks are

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,570
still being removed the new blocks being

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,640
added as far as what's coming in to 5.0

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,709
release these are just a few of the

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,510
default blocks basically anything you

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,610
expect paragraphs headings quotes

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,770
galleries but also some new blocks a lot

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,660
of layout blocks of the column block

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,730
button block there's a lot of new things

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,290
coming as we think about how to use a

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,460
more visual or blogger a new festival so

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,560
really quickly for those of you don't

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,840
know me I'm grant handler kind of brave

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,460
introduction but I just want to note

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,810
that I'm currently on Twitter if you

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,460
want to connect with me I love to

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,750
connect with you all send me questions

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,430
if you have any questions during the

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:53,520
presentation I can read them off Twitter

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:54,840
at the end or we can go ahead and so we

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,230
will be from blocks the blocks right

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,540
it's a fundamental almost revolutionary

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,700
change to WordPress one thing that I

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,570
think is worth doing is stopping and

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,979
asking why why make such a big change

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,479
right we all know changes are

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:14,370
particularly by software we do excuse me

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,479
WordPress is doing great right over 30%

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,430
of the internet all we hear about is

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,750
WordPress is growing in popularity that

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,490
it's easy to use that's straightforward

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,950
and one of the reasons why people choose

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,350
WordPress is because it's intuitive and

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,910
everybody knows it so why fundamental

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,220
change well I think a revolutionary

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,340
change to the way that one of the core

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,360
things about WordPress works well few

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,910
reasons one is creating the more visual

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,250
editing experience so with the

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,340
proliferation of online site building

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,490
tools things like Squarespace makes even

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,919
page builder tool

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,319
WordPress a more moderate web user is

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,270
getting more used to and actually as

00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,710
expecting a more visual adding

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,080
experience thing about media right

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,300
editing where you're editing actually

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,520
what you're thinking looks like

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,319
Gutenberg promises to give us a bit more

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,880
of an visualizing experience and this is

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
this is a promise in which I think it

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,020
really really delivers and is one where

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,880
WordPress needs to catch back up and get

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,979
a little bit ahead of what the broad or

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,160
CMS market is delivering if we were to

00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:16,660
stick with the classic editor you know I

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,949
think the frustrations that come along

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,400
with that classic editor who knows the

00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,720
terms save and surprise but yeah it's

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,030
one of the ex-cops Alana may even see a

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
whole lot where did you know a client or

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,909
somebody is ending in WordPress and they

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,110
lay out their paragraphs and they put a

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,130
few majors and they write a lot in the

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,659
image and they think it's everything

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,919
looks great save me go look at their

00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,360
page it'll look surprised

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,009
nothing will like wouldn't look like in

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,330
a classic editor maybe it's cuz their

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,069
theme styles are doing something a

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,750
little bit different with it maybe it's

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,880
because they thought they put that image

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,099
floating in between paragraph two and

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,780
three but really in the HTML exploded

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,979
midway through the third paragraph and

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,440
it shows up walking on the front end

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,969
Guttenberg promises to get rid of a lot

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,979
of that states a surprise by making the

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:57,639
backend for digital editing experience

00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:03,580
and and translating that in and really

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:05,110
showing you what what it's like so the

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,120
next reason is more granular control

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,710
this is almost feel super

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,090
straightforward and and we almost take

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,729
it for granted when we talk about block

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,430
based editors but some things are

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:18,069
individual blocks this is a this is such

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,690
a fundamental change in the granular

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,440
control that we have over blocks so in

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,960
this block you'll see I've got a title

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,000
normal paragraph and then I started to

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,009
customize this middle paragraph we've

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,349
got the block settings bar over here and

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,930
I've selected a color background color

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,669
text I've been able to highlight

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,530
a specific paragraph and customize the

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,110
right from the GUI of my header now this

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,400
this could be possible in the previous

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,259
class together but you probably have to

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,210
edit some HTML at a class and that

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,410
affects us with CSS to your normal

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,580
average end-user and that's just not

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,160
accessible thing to do

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,110
certainly not intuitive with a Gutenberg

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,820
editor this is you specifically iceberg

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,949
a the type of a modular controller

00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,960
you're going to be able to have over

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,490
things like paragraphs let's take our

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,169
image example that I that I threw up

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,389
previously about the right left aligned

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,820
now images there are their own blocks

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,020
it's an image block we've got this great

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,669
settings bar right on the right-hand

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,039
side where I can control everything

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,570
about the image the width the height

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,610
alignment and it'll live update here

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,930
amongst the other blocks have show me

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,120
amongst the other blocks how is this

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,430
going to look much more visual much more

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,520
granular much more accessible music for

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,349
the end-user to use so the third reason

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,759
and probably one of the most exciting

00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,250
one of the things that I was most

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,690
excited that's an agency person when I

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,089
first started using Guttenberg

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,979
it's more powerful editing and page

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,050
builder so things that you previously

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,479
just could not do in the classic editor

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,260
without shortcuts and everybody knows

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,740
short codes

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,390
mixbag right most of the time not great

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,640
things like closed right are now going

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,589
to be extremely easy to do right within

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,180
the UI for you as well as for your end

00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,950
user big thing you might have had to

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,180
build a page template work for do other

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,870
PHP CSS or again short codes will be

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,130
able to do

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:08,459
buttonless these is straightforward as

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,459
spacers

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,760
spacer so you know we can add bottom

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,770
margin to our paragraphs what if you

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
have a couple of inches in the row and

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,320
you don't like the margins being added

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,180
you don't want a lot of margin between

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,410
the first and second image but you want

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,540
a little bit of margin after the third

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,040
image things like spacer a spacer block

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,670
will allow you to create space within

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,980
your post

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,840
wherever you want another use case I

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,400
like here is giving a lot fo a little

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,810
bit of rain agree right let's say you

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,910
have a hope you really want to stand out

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,350
I'm going to bump up the text size but

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,610
then I bump up the text size and there's

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,200
a whole lot of space in between the two

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,970
paragraphs on either side throw a couple

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,830
of spacer blocks on either side you've

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,760
got a little bit of in the brief people

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,070
are going to be able to learn how we

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,170
build and layout pages and posts with

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,520
these more visual editors and actually

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:58,510
see what it's going to look like in the

00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:02,980
background before so blockage just got

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:06,640
added on Friday's beta is the media and

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,260
text block yeah some people and these

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,780
babies that we all build where it's a

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,160
media item and some text on it and then

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,990
we've got some standard text below it

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,400
and then media island on the riot a text

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,050
on the left and some set of text below

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,250
it right laying those pictures out and

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,570
that we would have either had an

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,240
engagement page builder type of

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:30,220
situation or go ahead and build anything

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:31,690
from scratch now those are reusable

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,890
content blocks this is one of my

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,700
favorite so any block that you create

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,350
you can go ahead and press the button

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,750
say I want to make it a reusable block

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,660
you save it so I'm saving it let's say I

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,220
have a profile like a profile of me that

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,410
I want to put at the top or the bottom

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,120
of every article that I write but I

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,650
don't want to build it into a single dot

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,650
PHP template because there's other

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,180
authors on my site and I don't want to

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,460
show up at the bottom of every single

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,310
post I can create a reusable profile

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,950
lock just okay I save it as grants

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,510
profile block and then anytime I want to

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,220
use that any other posts or any other

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,440
picture on the side I just search for it

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,640
up and there just saved right away it's

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,290
sorted into it and the cool thing is

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,060
those blocks are all linked so if I

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,890
profile updates I go on updated with one

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,230
place it updates across every single

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,890
post every single page is using site 19

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,730
is do

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:25,490
really really cool block and last but

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,890
not least widgets in dynamic content so

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,090
you can insert widgets into any post or

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,550
page so if you're on

00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,550
got an inserting latest posts widget to

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,900
search for widgets this could be

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,000
anything that's gonna be a MailChimp

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,500
signup widget this could be any ol digit

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,270
that you have it activated on your site

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,220
and I've dropped three of my latest

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,970
posts in the middle of a post or a page

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,100
I can choose layout options like list or

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,990
grid this can be customized with yes

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,520
that's I can access the classes to it

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,400
that can be targeting the CSS just

00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:03,380
really powerful post and page building

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:05,600
tools again so all of this stuff is

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,210
probably doable before either via

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,190
shortcuts or mayonnaise builder plugins

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,100
but the cool thing is that many of those

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,710
solutions are definitely not easy to

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,300
write as easy as a class right they took

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,250
the learning curve and many of our

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,420
clients just wouldn't end up learning

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,270
how to use it right there wasn't the

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,160
time with the investment there and it's

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,070
certainly weren't intuitive right like

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,870
if easy-to-use is a water here like

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,920
intuitive is a little bit higher all

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,450
right where it just kind of makes sense

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,240
if people understand you understand how

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,730
to use it and it's certainly the higher

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,910
law is keeping up with the modern trend

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,230
of visual page building and visual CMS

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,480
is that around there at the market and

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,940
Gutenberg does a really good job with

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,150
caching WordPress up to to that market

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,740
so if you're poor like from that if the

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,850
users will kinda be able to build the

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,619
site's they've seen their imagine a

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,119
I think for those of us who build sites

00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:00,189
we gotta take shortcuts for granted in

00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:02,529
those those tricky ways that we've found

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,329
I found a way to build more robust

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,739
functionality or editors into our page

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,269
builders but they're really really

00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:08,799
frustrating for end users and users

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,989
don't have to get those things and

00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,100
access lucky every shortcut is set up a

00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:15,970
little bit differently different

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:20,709
variables variables so it's really nice

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,540
to be thinking beyond thinking about you

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:27,850
know the more powerful page building

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:30,369
editing experience so one of the

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,220
features that I'm most excited about and

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:35,919
it's one of the most forward-looking

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,600
features of the new forgetter when it's

00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,160
not gotten as much publicity it's not

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
been written about as much I think I've

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,319
only seen a couple of people talking

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,699
about this one is the idea of templating

00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:47,769
so the examples that I've shown you

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,329
before it's kind of a blank slate you

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,040
can add a title block you have a

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,869
paragraph block and you start to build a

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,609
post or a page from scratch pretty much

00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:56,739
what you think of as the traditional CMS

00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:58,689
any experience blank slate to sit down

00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,489
and start writing but as we all know at

00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:02,019
least those who build websites for

00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:03,160
clients you give a client a blank slate

00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,389
of the page or post and they're not

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,309
always going to deliver on that vision

00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,499
of what you design right you give them

00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:10,029
four or five page templates you set up a

00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,379
couple examples and the first time they

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,389
go to create a new page on their own

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,249
they call you when they say it's not

00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,809
working now I can expect it or you know

00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:19,029
if you visit their site or it just

00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,160
doesn't quite look like what you design

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,660
because maybe they forgot to do

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,199
something in the way that you built it

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,989
for them

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,730
so they had templating in the Gutenberg

00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:31,209
is that you can actually buy a page

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,549
template or post type create a default

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,020
set of blocks that are already pre added

00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:37,730
to the page when they go

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,950
most so in this example this person is

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,110
adding a title a full width image a

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,230
couple of headings and some paragraphs a

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,450
button with placeholders you can define

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,070
all of this in the walks API and you can

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,350
to make it so that they cannot remove

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,740
blocks right you can create a custom

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,170
post type maybe it's team members right

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,120
and every single team member has to have

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,430
these six blocks in their fill that in

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,380
order to deliver on that vision deliver

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,880
on that visual design and all they have

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,620
to do is go ahead and fill it out every

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,110
time so you can already do this in the

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,400
blocks API that's coming out soon and

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,380
this is gonna be one of those things

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,750
guys that makes gonna be built on and

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,310
really expanded where I think theme

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,960
authors right how many times have you

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,220
heard about people buying custom themes

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,510
and then they get in there and they

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,490
can't really figure out how to set it up

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,270
and make it look like the demo that they

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,710
saw online

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,450
this is probably gonna be something

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,430
lower to buy a theme authors where they

00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,410
set up page templates and post Doc's in

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,410
a very customized way and fill it out

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,160
cool so what I has talked about is a lot

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,410
of the major features that are going to

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,120
be shipping in the US coming five foot

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,010
on these WordPress the new Gutenberg

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,140
editor going from a blog based editor to

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,490
a blockhouse editor but I want to talk a

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,830
little bit about the future about what's

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,600
coming after that because what a lot of

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,780
most people don't know is that the

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,790
goober editor revolutionising the page

00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,770
in the post creation process is just

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,020
phase one of this grand revision it's

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,460
just phase one of this project so what

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,500
the Guttenberg editor block is editor

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,420
does is it lays the foundation for

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,450
bigger things when it comes to page

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,260
building and customization so we're

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,550
going to talk about a couple of

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,110
different examples and kind of try to

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,360
make this decision for what's coming

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,820
down the pike but now that we have

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,830
modular blocks in the editor think about

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,670
something like poetic something that has

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,320
not previously been possible without

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,060
being out the editor altogether and

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,220
shoving and something completely

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,780
different but imagine that because it's

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,910
modular somebody could build a plug in

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,560
it that adds States to each of the

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,610
blocks and allows different people to

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
the other thing that the blocks at the

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,510
same time right so this blocks being

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,520
intended by madmen and I'm down here

00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,900
grant is down here adding block this

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,250
doesn't currently exist I don't know if

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,930
there's any ongoing work on employment

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,360
like this but I imagine in the future

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,160
because the more modular broken down and

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,050
no longer be locked out on a page or

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
post level basis like they are now you

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,170
may be able to get in there and edit

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,180
together which would expand WordPress in

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,980
a whole new market of newsrooms and

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,560
high-volume sites where you might want

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,420
to have 25 30 35 people working on the

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,370
same piece of content in time people at

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,949
the New York Times built their own CMS

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,209
specifically to build their own custom

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,160
publishing worthless because they want

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,480
upwards of 50 people to be working on

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,339
the same breaking news story all the

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,350
same time this would open up WordPress

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:21,360
to a custom box so custom blocks are

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,770
already being developed by a lot of

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,589
developers out there we've seen the

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,850
writing on the wall there's already a

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,940
number of custom blocks that you can

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,380
install and test but we're gonna see

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,600
more and more rapid custom block

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,930
development over there coming weeks

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,280
months and years as well comes out this

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,310
is what actually being worked on by the

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,460
automatic for community team so mail

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,590
choice Ian's done I think is around here

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,180
somewhere but this is for the working

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,000
web sites

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,410
this would be a speaker's walk so what

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,820
you have is an enter the speaker's block

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,410
and you can either now put all of the

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,750
speaker's from the speaker's custom post

00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,820
type or you could pick specific speakers

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,010
to put and it'll automatically go grab

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,660
all those posts out put them visually

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,550
how they're going to show up and give

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,950
you a bunch of really cool options do I

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,630
what size do I want them to be do I want

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,310
the images to be there where the line of

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,620
the images do I want it in a grid or

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,690
list right these are these are ways to

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,640
build pages rapidly and dynamically with

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,100
content on your site this is just again

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,419
it's tip of the iceberg

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:27,470
block development you guys are going to

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:31,039
see coming out so finally I want to talk

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,630
about the WYSIWYG problem so Morton

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,830
grant Hendrickson did a great talking as

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:39,289
a webcam us great great talk he spent

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,600
about 30 minutes talking about I was

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:43,880
going about five but this is one of the

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,679
most exciting things that is on the

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:51,110
radar it's probably one of the more

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:54,440
ambitious goals of the project but that

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,960
is what you see has never really been

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,360
what you got when it comes to building a

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,919
post and that is to say remember I

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,960
example of the classic editor it's a

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,260
blog of content a blog of content gets

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,820
out quickly on your page but that's not

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,370
all that's going on in your site right

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,530
before an end-user to build a page and

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,230
looking at the editor and just be

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,000
controlling that area of the site is not

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,770
a very intuitive thing it's not really

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,240
what you see is what you get what you

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,940
see is what you get within this tiny

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,140
little box maybe right if you do it

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,740
perfectly and you have that in there

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,289
styles

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,820
what about so Gutenberg is moving to a

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,340
block base right and that's making this

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,860
department but it's still confined to

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,270
this content right what about all these

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,919
other areas what about your header in

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,360
your navigation what about your sidebar

00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,309
what about your footer what about all

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,470
the other modular areas of your site you

00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:45,169
still don't have great visibility in the

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:48,530
post can page editor into hacker sites

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,720
actually don't write we tend up we saw a

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,840
lot of conflicts happen here when it

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:58,640
happens things like writing a story

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,690
about you know nonprofits outreach

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,059
communications in southern Africa and

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,800
its really heavy really sensitive topic

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,400
maybe

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,870
in 2003 2004 the expose and you know

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,820
what looks great in the editor and all

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,010
that on all that stuff and preview it

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,930
and even that looks really good but then

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,540
when it gets served up the things that

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:23,830
are in the sidebar are really culturally

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,630
insensitive attacks it's like that right

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,360
it's is still a disjointed experience

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,980
and the first version of the block race

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,870
editor doesn't really solve that first

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:36,010
version of blockers editors still really

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:38,950
focus on this content area another part

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,890
of cookie really frustrating for your

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,480
end user is that they edit this page and

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,780
they generally how they want but in

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,190
order to get the other areas of the site

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,810
looking how they want they gotta go to a

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,580
number of different places within their

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,200
admin appearance menus to get your menu

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,570
just right the parents customized maybe

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,250
to make sure your site title is the logo

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,110
is your site tagline there may be

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,250
appearance theme options because maybe

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,480
if they're right and custom thing

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,860
they're kind of theme options that then

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,150
you'd be customized together and looking

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,620
the way they want you gotta go to

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,690
appearance widgets to get your sidebar

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,340
and if you have multiple sidebars great

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,530
if you don't you're stuck with one set

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,030
up here's menus for the footer it's

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,890
customized for the right you got all all

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,740
these places just to get your single

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,930
poster paint exactly how that's on

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,200
experience and the block my senator

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:28,090
doesn't really solve against what this

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:29,980
poor thing but what if it could but it

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,840
could solve all these other areas right

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,090
and that's the vision that's the vision

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,520
that and the ambition that this poor

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,260
project has to install a center is what

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,960
if we could take the same concept of

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,360
taking one admin screen with a blob of

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,330
content moving that into blocks when we

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,519
met a more visual

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,990
and live up to all these other areas of

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,230
your site and create a more seamless

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,269
more visual and intuitive sight building

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,340
site layout template building experience

00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,340
what if all of these things go lost

00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:02,570
block block block block block and you

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,720
can have many blocks as well what if

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,340
every would what if a foot arrived what

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,500
if everything was a walking you can

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,419
visually layout choose from the plethora

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,820
of custom blocks build your own blocks

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,890
with you more confined the traditional

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:21,409
content types of menus and widgets and

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:24,169
and all of this is from the actual

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:26,539
WordPress handle that's been up for a

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:28,279
while a rough road map is be wanted this

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,659
block by senator project is posted page

00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,740
editor that's we spent a lot of time

00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,960
talking about today that's been a major

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,899
focus goods made around Buford and what

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,120
it does but second is the page template

00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:40,250
but if you can create entire tempest

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,659
with blocks arranging them and only a

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,309
part of that template was the content

00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,039
interaction right another part of that

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,250
is other things and then three lifts you

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,269
could build your entire site in blocks

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,179
visually and from the background your

00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:55,970
site one of my favorite books for

00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,710
morning news leagues ahead of me on this

00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,029
debate and definitely an evaluative do

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,769
building and checking out his pops of

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,380
word campus he's got a great article

00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:05,809
that I link to in the resources at the

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,669
end of this slide that but he says it if

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,370
future after the fulfillment of the new

00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,350
birdie and revolution is involvement you

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,029
will go to WordPress to create views by

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,929
writing some content and are pulling in

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:19,220
different blocks of content so it's

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,289
really really interesting because it

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,299
kind of turns the whole intuitive

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,880
familiarity of WordPress one has had and

00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,919
that can be a little bit scary but I but

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,330
I like the way that they are starting

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,340
with the posted page editor where it

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,470
makes a lot of sense right

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,860
frustration continues personal they're

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,680
gonna kind of matriculate this this new

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,750
world out there get people used to that

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,580
and over time to see this start to

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:48,440
spread out so what that covered quite a

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,430
bit and talked about what's coming we

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,880
talked about what's coming up in the

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:55,490
future so a quick review we've got the

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,350
final 5.0 beta 5 coming out in just a

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,900
few days there that's Wednesday or

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,670
Thursday we've got the police candidate

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,350
one scheduled for the 19th and we've got

00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,330
the 5.0 released scheduled for a long

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,700
time so it's just got this is the new

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,380
schedule posted as a Friday so there's

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,900
just not much doubt about these

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:17,390
deadlines so WordPress 5.0 is coming and

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,740
it's really loose first thing is don't

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,750
freak out right like this is a

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,400
revolution this is a big change but

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,410
there's a lot to be excited about and

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,890
there's really not a whole lot to be

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,070
afraid of

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,620
it's account about for a few reasons one

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,880
you can start testing now the gutenberg

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,260
plugin is readily available has been

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,700
readily available for a long time i've

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,890
been running it in production on my site

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,540
for a long time it is buggy right I

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,100
think you know a lot of people are tuned

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,510
into this conversation there are a lot

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,280
of concerns around whether it's ready or

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,840
not there's bugginess there's a lack of

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,000
accessibility and certain things in the

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,290
end there these are real good problems

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,420
that a lot of people are focused on in

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,150
it I know we're going to solve but it's

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,830
not a reason that to shy away from what

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,480
they need five points and always to shy

00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,010
away from shutting the test this is

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,900
absolutely the future what we're purses

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,430
going to look like and it's not really

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,430
worth relativity this farce off Danny

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,720
really

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,980
so install the good work plug on your

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,470
local installed on staging nominee

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,210
production yeah but get testing with it

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,769
get familiar with it this is going to be

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,179
a big part of the conversation when it

00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:19,350
comes to anything we're pressed for the

00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,000
next three to five years right you use

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,039
the resources available to you there are

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,230
tons and tons of themes and plugins and

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,669
articles there's so much emphasis on

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,399
this a lot of popular plugins that

00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:32,220
gravity forums Yost and others already

00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,700
have were compatible interface is good

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,809
work the pad with custom blocks at tena

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,190
tab has already developed a couple of

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,570
custody and plugins that work with

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,860
Gutenberg a lot of folks are really

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,039
getting at this so there's a ton of

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,169
resources a ton of stuff that previously

00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,000
used to be a pay plugin or used to cost

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,250
hundreds of hours of development that

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,330
you can now do an appointment as people

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,510
are trying to get ahead of this picture

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,070
of sentence go ahead and upgrade even if

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,720
you don't want to use gutenberg going to

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,480
upgrade what if i throw things out the

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,830
clock of the classic editor as always

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,470
it's going to be available for at least

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,179
a couple of the years as a plugin so you

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,909
can just upgrade and install the classic

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,130
editor and the admin will be be very

00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:12,720
similar to what it was before but always

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,860
always they operate if you want to stay

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,690
upgraded to get the latest and greatest

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,039
from software and really like the

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,750
biggest things just start building start

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,840
doing it's really cool it's very very

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:28,500
powerful at ten I was already starting

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,659
to build sites little prototypes for a

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,460
pitching strategy with Gutenberg there's

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,529
a really really cool way to very very

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,840
quickly prototype atom experiences

00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:40,139
prototype flatten experiences prototype

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,639
workflows for for editorial it's

00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:44,279
something that anybody can do really

00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:47,370
really quickly once you get that and

00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,720
follow along because this project is

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,309
coming out so hot because it's such a

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,940
big part of the future of WordPress

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,849
there's going to be a ton of really

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,859
iteration time really really rapid

00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,049
innovation so I have no doubt within the

00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,159
next six months there's going to be some

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,599
people are going to turn Gutenberg on

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,669
it's had to do some really really cool

00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,929
things because it's reactivates because

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,909
it's more visual because it's more

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,070
modular the sky's the limit as far as

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,289
what what we can do with this money

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,849
so definitely follow along the words of

00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,769
the Gutenberg Handbook is a good place

00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:19,159
to go to to bone up on this and I've got

00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:21,789
a bunch of links to resources the

00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,129
handbooks a good place make blog core

00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:28,489
they're punching a lot of pigs on this I

00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:30,559
grabbed that screenshot for the word

00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:33,739
campsite custom plugin just from the

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,090
make blog macnell publish the post the

00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:37,220
other day that was just like working on

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,749
our custom block for speakers they

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,220
posted a bunch of comps and invision

00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:42,529
link so I went through there and what

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,389
they're doing so it's really cool to go

00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,769
in and see what the what the leaders in

00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:52,249
this space I'm working on as far as

00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:53,509
custom blocks it's all there so just a

00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:53,869
couple of special thanks on to thank

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:56,989
Helen

00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:58,549
lieutenant Gordon Parker Wiley was here

00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,529
part of the Seattle Community that all

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:02,450
the organizers the Guttenberg team team

00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:03,979
ten off just all the people to help me

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,570
kind of gather my thoughts and ideas

00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:07,340
around the demeanor with help contribute

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,679
to Gutenberg development I've got a list

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,479
of resources here and the slides are

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,919
available at bitly - Newton Prez

00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:18,700
if you'd like to go grab a slice with

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,700
all of these resources

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,479
you answer questions we've got any time

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,489
yeah lots of hands I'm gonna just let

00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:45,129
our volunteer here pick who goes when

00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:47,320
bye-bye so I'm just curious you're

00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:48,999
saying the gutenberg plug-in is buggy is

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,889
that buggy like you can tell us as a

00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:52,889
worker buddy like your website crashes

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,629
good question much more than former

00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:00,940
right it's much more it's not even you

00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:04,089
can italicize the word it's I hover over

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,190
a column block I can't quite yeah

00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:07,809
the edge of the column you know because

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,139
I want to select in an app setting right

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,789
there's still some UI works there there

00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,249
have been a lot of little bugs too like

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:18,039
when you tab from this one to this one

00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:19,239
it skips over that right there's a lot

00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,039
of those little things just with the

00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:23,169
because it's so new and because of the

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,389
rapid pace of development so it's much

00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,879
more of these small this would frustrate

00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,469
an end-user and will probably frustrate

00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:36,059
you for a little bit until you get the

00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:36,059
hanging the type of bugs not good

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:46,190
I am working with Timmy so how will

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,650
their page builder interact with

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:51,110
Gutenberg yeah so page builders are kind

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,550
of rushing to figure out that out beaver

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,110
builder published a big long post I

00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,550
think nine or twelve months ago saying

00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,190
we're working on it we're trying to

00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:01,360
figure out how we coexist how I would do

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,730
that I think that because the ultimate

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,960
goal of Guttenberg is to make site and

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,030
page building

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,570
easier and more accessible I really do

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,860
think more than ever these it we speak

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,350
traditional what you think of as

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,760
divvying and beaver builder are in more

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,640
and more direct competition with one

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,390
another particularly as the Gutenberg

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,800
editor expands beyond the content so I

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,680
think those page builder plugins are

00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,600
going are trying to figure out right now

00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,040
what do we bring that WordPress core

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,570
that the block base editor app a

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,250
drilling part gonna do because that's

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,260
always been their thing right it's like

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,360
WordPress stops here and then we're

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,190
gonna pick it up and and go forward

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,930
WordPress is pushing further into that

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,120
market so it's gonna be interesting to

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,730
see where they land for you specifically

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,690
I think it'll be can you would see all

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,880
of the things that you're achieving

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,070
right now with Divi into you block base

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,980
editor and if so you know think about

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,290
how you move an update into that or stay

00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,100
with what you've got but you know I'd be

00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,110
reading their blog

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,490
I'd be pinging them with what are you

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,320
guys have plans what are you looking at

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,240
what's your roadmap a lot of them may

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,860
just continue to say that's behind

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,960
they're moving into our space we think

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,669
we do it better we have a product we

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,529
have a lawyer

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,179
customer base and we want people to

00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:16,119
continue to use our product instead of

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:18,309
the locker senator not as an ally but a

00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,139
lot of that is TBD from a lot of stuffs

00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:22,629
I haven't seen I don't be real here I

00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:24,129
haven't seen the definitive this is how

00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,909
we're going to approach Ruttenberg and

00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:33,729
how we're going to look at that

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:35,739
environment but how is going to affect

00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,879
the themes that we've used you know

00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:39,369
confusing something that's been

00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:40,889
customized U is perhaps on there and

00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:43,809
they gonna get out of that gave it away

00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:45,669
yeah depends on your theme offer and how

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,619
ahead of the time they are a lot of

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:49,809
things will publish updates and say

00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,119
we're now in perfect battle which simply

00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,709
means they're going to write styles that

00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,109
work with all of the default WordPress

00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:59,979
Weber clocks the cool thing is that a

00:31:56,109 --> 00:32:02,679
theme doesn't necessarily have to that

00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:04,619
certainly allows you to leverage all of

00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,879
those different types of blocks that's

00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,739
there's full with blocks which cover

00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:10,029
image blocks that there's not like whoo

00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,799
bird shits with a bunch of styles that

00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,809
will try and do it pretty well for you

00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:15,809
so just because that means I'm saying oh

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,549
but because it's restricted to the post

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,019
content area

00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,909
if you've customized a lot of other

00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:29,139
parts of everything Gutenberg you know

00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:31,179
goobers not gonna mess with your head or

00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:34,359
a capacity of cleric mr. sidebar it's

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:36,339
restricted to that content area so it's

00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,679
going to be you know if I were you I'd

00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:40,269
take a staging site or a local

00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:40,980
development environment and activate

00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,179
good work

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,549
right out of hopes and used a bunch of

00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,380
blocks and see how it looks right use

00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,530
the cover image block use the full width

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,850
image block my hunch is it'll look

00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,710
pretty good right there might be a

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,270
little bit of like well the full with

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,970
alignment doesn't actually go fill up

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,679
because you have a couple of main

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,090
wrappers around it and it doesn't allow

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,610
to go full width and so you don't need

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,740
to decide that way if the work won't be

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,480
lugging the theme author to update and

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,799
go ahead and allow Li do things like

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,020
that so yeah I think that in his talk

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,600
last weekend at work in Portland

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,250
he said he's hoping that the you know

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,090
with all of the kind of churn that's

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,160
been around this the rush to push a 5.0

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,880
on gutenberg he's hoping it's the it's

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,980
the anticlimactic

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,510
major release because people will go

00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,429
over guys they'll get updated in the

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,990
bitter cup okay she's blocked a senator

00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,809
now the content shows up in the content

00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:42,600
and the rest might english raid okay I

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:45,419
think for most people that on your how

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,760
to prepare page this question related to

00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,669
that I recently like in the last three

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,809
or four days got a note from Wu you

00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:56,549
telling me that before I update to

00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:58,830
WordPress black dot oh I need to

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:02,010
absolutely make sure I update for

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,809
commerce 23.5 got one yeah so my

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,110
question is for you and anybody else in

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,090
the room

00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,710
hey have you updated through commerce

00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,140
305 got one yet

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,900
I've never gotten a note from them

00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,580
and be have you found many problems in

00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,810
doing so gotcha

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,580
I think that's probably good hallway

00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,440
discussion I have not done it so I don't

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,740
have any insights for you but if others

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,290
have updated we got Merrill in the

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,630
furball she's will come expert Thank You

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,300
marrow yeah you guys should be enough to

00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:33,460
talk about Luke on my hunch is that they

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:41,740
are bringing a lot of new American

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:43,990
uranium my hunch is that they're

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,030
releasing a bunch of custom blocks and a

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,530
bunch of custom styles that allow you to

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,270
really take advantage of the walkways

00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,440
architecture and they really want you to

00:34:49,270 --> 00:35:01,270
update so that you get all of that

00:34:50,440 --> 00:35:04,600
goodness that's so how will it or will

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,410
it affect that the actual HTML it looks

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:13,900
like it's more semantic or might

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:16,900
encourage more semantic type of it will

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:21,040
impact nice to them yeah so you divert

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,470
Locke's output and good ol HTML a lot of

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,560
the things that you do in the blocks

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,470
output inline styles so in my example

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,530
where I color-coded that paragraph right

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,030
I would output inline Styles to to add a

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,650
little stop step paragraph so will

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:39,040
impact HTML but it's the s you know

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:41,170
within the content area of your of your

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:48,670
post so you don't have to worry about it

00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:50,950
impacting other you're mentioning these

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,930
spacer blocks that triggered this did

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,030
they do you know up those were at a

00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:00,220
point yet where it allows responsiveness

00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:03,580
controls quickly yeah yeah if you have

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,800
to write media queries yeah I think it's

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,800
pixel base

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,050
Oh sort updates will be coming and you

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,520
can always write that custom spacer

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,560
block you can take that block and add on

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,510
to it extend it I know a lot of what

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,490
they're adding in kind of some of the

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,810
final beta releases and I'm sure we'll

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,090
add it on future releases this

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,160
extensibility to the default core blocks

00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,980
that ship with Gutenberg and you can

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,000
always spin up your own custom block in

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,970
creative space to where allows me ask my

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,910
question is about coexistence so first

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,920
can you have been committed some pages

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,690
using Gutenberg and have other pages

00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,300
that are with the classic editor and

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:47,590
number two since I think there's about a

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,420
hundred gazillion websites out there can

00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,790
you repeat again or are you sure that

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,300
the classic editor will not ship you

00:36:51,790 --> 00:37:00,310
have to manually install a plug-in

00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:05,380
correct so first question is remind me

00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:08,440
first question is what so I do not think

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,060
that's going to ship in 500 but Matt

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,880
specifically talked about that last week

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,560
if they'd like to be able to a date or

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,920
feature where you can put it on or off

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,930
by the author so you were a user and you

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,590
log in you want Gutenberg you can write

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,390
with Gutenberg

00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,550
somebody else from your team or who owns

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:27,880
the sidekick login and use just the

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,170
classic so my hunch is that the ability

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,580
to do that is there but it's not going

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,620
to be a core feature either ever turned

00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:40,030
on or turned off anybody chime in if

00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:41,740
there's and then second it was a plug

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,200
installation of the plug-in not shipping

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,450
with the yes it doesn't it you have to

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,070
this all book yeah when if you update to

00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:52,420
5.0 you're automatically going to get

00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,810
food burn my hunch is I don't want to

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,360
speculate

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,590
well there's a prompt or not to say I my

00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,210
hunch is I'll have the promise I don't

00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,340
like this you click here install this

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,770
plug-in and you'll be fine but there is

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,420
one canonical classic editor plugin and

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:08,470
they said they're guaranteed support

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:11,170
through 2021 so the classic editor will

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,480
be there and available to you sorry and

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,810
the automatic update that will

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,570
automatically take you to fire or if you

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,830
have automatic updates turned on I'm not

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:25,120
sure if automatic updates do major

00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:33,460
releases or if they just do - yeah it's

00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:36,250
a major 5.0 release so if you talked

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,080
about the blocks API and page template

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,970
and post type templates yeah is that

00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,170
something that's shipping the 5.0 or is

00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,610
that a coming that's going to be there

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,260
yes they're all the documentation

00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,110
they're in the documentation is awesome

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,420
just WordPress top or black with black

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,210
hand book and all the block API

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:56,380
documentation there is a really great

00:38:51,210 --> 00:39:00,580
learning react right because this react

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,800
I read all a lot of JavaScript expert at

00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,260
all I spent a few weeks studying react

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,320
online and after that I could read the

00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,820
blog API just by its really really cool

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,990
there's a couple of starter block

00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,990
templates out there too

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,849
in 15 or 20 minutes now I came with a

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,410
couple of weeks worth of studying

00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,440
reactive learning what I was looking at

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,180
in JavaScript but it's it's becoming

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,230
more and more and more accessible and

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,089
they're doing a really good job of

00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,150
documentation so yeah the handbook is a

00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:32,440
great place to start so maybe I didn't

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,619
fully understand what you just said

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,510
because my question was am I still going

00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:41,500
to be able to look at the code behind

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:46,920
the blog where I can look at the code

00:39:41,500 --> 00:40:20,769
and see what it's doing yeah yes so

00:39:46,920 --> 00:40:22,690
there's a you can there's one of the

00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:24,700
concerns that came up a lot in the

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,559
development community was what's this

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:30,250
going to do to my custom post types or

00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:32,140
other things like that and it sounds

00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,240
like there's been a huge amount of

00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,220
progress getting that license and all

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,869
the other meta boxes and all the other

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,299
things working yeah I just discovered a

00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:46,059
plug-in called Guttenberg Ram are 8mp

00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:48,910
and that all it does is lets you decide

00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:51,039
where this custom post type for this

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,799
post type do my one thing is good and

00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,509
Burger Time yeah and that's that's for

00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:58,509
people who are concerned about that

00:40:55,509 --> 00:41:01,119
that's a nice tool it doesn't seem high

00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:02,900
impact absolutely and so that's a core

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,450
part of the API so you can

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,400
Bhd turn Gutenberg on in different

00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,690
places in your sight my whole style so I

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,740
think that plugin is just making it

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:15,079
easier for not good and for people who

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,539
are concerned about missing not

00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,849
installing the classic editor isn't

00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:24,470
there a custom isn't there a classic

00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:26,029
block as well there is well so I don't

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,819
know if it actually allows you to select

00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:30,559
plastic block but if you update right so

00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,079
if I update the same I wrote a page in

00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,690
classic ender and I update it will

00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,670
automatically return that chunk of text

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,880
from my classic editor on say my about

00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,430
page into a paragraph block it will keep

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,750
it as a hey you wrote this in classic

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,059
globe do you want to go ahead and

00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,099
upgrade this to blocks or no and you can

00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:50,420
decide to leave it I don't know

00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,829
last level looked at the UI and then

00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,359
actually see a classic block that I can

00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:55,970
go in and proactively create a new

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,980
classic login but it keeps your content

00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,980
into a classic block if you upgraded

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,579
so my company is just now getting ready

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,859
to do a big redesign you remember the

00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,410
website that's one of the questions I've

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:27,690
been throwing out there is are we going

00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:35,069
to be looking at more Cooper based type

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:38,970
things or Horst Gutenberg so would you

00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:44,579
recommend then going that route looking

00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:47,460
at goober beans now yeah I would with a

00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,640
number of cats right your customer were

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,240
asking that I would because it's it's

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,069
the future

00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,950
that's right you might as well get ahead

00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:58,410
of that train but there are a lot of

00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:01,499
cabinets right if you you know the

00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,420
accessibility is is getting there but

00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:05,249
it's not there yet so that's a major you

00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,299
know requirement for your team I would

00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,430
take a look at that and they're saying

00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:10,289
how comfortable you are there I would

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:12,539
test it and use the UI and make sure

00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:14,609
that your team likes do I work for what

00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:16,440
you want to do but if I had to this

00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:18,690
black and white answer yes or no I would

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,819
definitely lean towards the let's go

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,789
ahead and get ahead of this and it's

00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:25,559
powerful it's forward-looking there's a

00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,119
lot of benefits to it and you know well

00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,009
there are a few drawbacks they're not

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,009
enough for me to just directly

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:38,150
the content migration from the classic

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,430
to very to the whole thing to a whole

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,109
new science so if you turn it on in a

00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,030
second we have a bunch of content

00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:45,650
written in classic it'll show a this

00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,680
content was written in classic do you

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,660
want to upgrade this to blocks right and

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,600
if you say yes let's say you have a five

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,580
paragraph about page it'll just turn it

00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:03,020
into five paragraph blocks so it's

00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:16,250
pretty pretty seamless got a couple up

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:18,230
here I think yes the question is are the

00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,990
table is column block and the gallery

00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,609
block going to be responsive so last

00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,750
time I'm using the column block it was

00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:25,970
not responsive

00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,280
it didn't shift with those front styles

00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,710
I think the reason why is they want they

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,940
want you to go ahead and fit in into the

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,800
responsive break they don't to make any

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,590
assumptions around where your your

00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,480
contacts got a break so you not direct

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:43,390
the breakpoints and the responsiveness

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:46,160
for those columns gallery might actually

00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,600
because you can select Regalia how many

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,950
home you know two three four five

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,050
columns but there's they Guttenberg what

00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:56,090
your eyes to balance that mind let's

00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:58,310
make this look great for you but let's

00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,050
not make too many subjective and shove a

00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:02,600
bunch of CSS the you may or may not like

00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,340
into your friend right so there will be

00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,710
some things that the theme will have to

00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,540
take care of so yeah Gutenberg

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,400
compatible themes should ship with all

00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,080
of the styles to make all of those

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,970
default lots of work if you're building

00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,490
a theme from scratch a part of the

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,780
testing process will be activating all

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,940
the lots of writing style to make sure

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,430
columns right two three four five six

00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:27,710
and the columns use flexbox so they're

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:30,230
they're pretty great okay two questions

00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:33,109
one with you giving us the length of the

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,760
slides is that because these are more

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:38,700
currents

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,700
than winter on the word campsite okay

00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,810
and then - can you detail more what you

00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:49,690
mean about accessibility my team also is

00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:53,260
about ready to do a major upgrade and I

00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,670
work for WSU and access our site has to

00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,560
be successful yep

00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,240
yeah so there's been a lot of community

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,310
discussion over the last couple of

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:06,250
months around the accessibility of the

00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:08,230
block based editor itself yeah the front

00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:11,740
end is still the thieves responsibility

00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,210
to ensure the markup in the outfit all

00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,680
styles and everything are accessible

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:20,260
it's specifically around the

00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:23,200
accessibility of the blogger is react

00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:26,140
used always to render the blocks or just

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,230
as a preview in the editor I'm wondering

00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,900
about server-side rendering and SEO yeah

00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,460
so not an expert but I believe yes react

00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,340
is used to render the blocks and it's

00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,200
the same the cool thing about Gutenberg

00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,220
is that it's the same thing that you're

00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,600
getting on the back and this way you're

00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:45,990
getting on Friday so you're getting the

00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,990
same output but you have to react to use

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:56,570
any more questions questions yes thank

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,570
you thanks

00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,820
