copywriting and strategic brand

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,689

join me and mommy and trans ilknur

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:10,600
I project a little bit yeah

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,880
alright so thank you so much for

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,649
attending my talk on this it was pretty

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,770
nuclear winter with my time o'clock less

00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,909
because in Canada that's Remembrance Day

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,540
[Music]

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:28,149
every so today we are you talking about

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,600
Gutenberg the new editor on everyone's

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:33,550
lips but I'm by no means a developer I

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,670
have a content creator I'm a blogger I

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,530
use WordPress as an end user so I wanted

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,539
to take a look into the third and the

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,940
third is I expected and play with it and

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:45,100
to prevent it a living tool for bloggers

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,090
and so I titled my top story time with

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,200
Gutenberg because I studied journalism

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,789
now I'm the chief content creators

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,979
background but for a long time I was

00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:56,380
working media and publishing and perfect

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,630
communications and so any tool that

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,270
promotes WordPress and pushes WordPress

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,069
as a publishing tool gets to be excited

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,349
and so I one of the few people that are

00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,660
like Gutenberg because everyone else is

00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:10,840
discussing all of the complications of

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,489
the pitfalls which are totally valid but

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,930
you won't get that in this talk in this

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,189
talk

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,359
trying to be as positive as possible

00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:19,290
about the opportunities that come to her

00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,099
so now that I've shared a little bit

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,069
about myself

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,989
I'm from the tree all I am known to use

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,090
Twitter at time so that's my animals you

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,420
want to reach out to me and I'm excited

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,400
about Gutenberg which is we apart from

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,599
other people and now that I've shared

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,719
that I want to know a little bit about

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,790
you specifically have you been using the

00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,689
word how do you tested it out how many

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,870
gear has tested all right that's a fair

00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,180
amount of Upolu so if you're not really

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,739
familiar with what uber is kind of hear

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,439
about it they haven't looked into it

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,260
very quickly Gutenberg I see maybe a new

00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,970
editing experience in WordPress and it's

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,599
slated to come out with the release of

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,239
WordPress 5.0 which is just a matter of

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,620
weeks away supposedly so the main

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,590
differences are really the experience

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,419
you're gonna have with with the editor

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,370
and so you'll see in the back or in the

00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,439
the dashboard as you know at the editor

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,079
as you know it and now and the front

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,560
you'll see the new Gutenberg editor and

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,359
how it looks so the difference is you

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,819
know will impact a lot of themes and

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,229
plugins developers battalion user most

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,959
of the changes are going to be felt

00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:30,560
right there in the editor so if you

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,069
haven't used it yet like I said it

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,470
official editor in the new release but

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,650
you can also install a new plugin in

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,450
fact in the last release of WordPress

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,239
there was a little uh that prompted you

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,830
to install it to try it out and right

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,959
next to it there's also the option to

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:52,849
install a classic editor so once the

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,700
WordPress people you can install the

00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:58,910
concept editor which is the way that the

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,340
record team made it as easy as possible

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,290
to transition from one to the next so if

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,030
you need a bit more time to transition

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,250
to new version you want to test it out

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,319
you can't install a copy editor on your

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,239
blog and continue to have the same

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,610
experience that you have because I know

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,739
a lot of people stopping dead in their

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,479
tracks your busy people to learn a whole

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,549
new way of editing especially if you

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,490
have all these automations and workflows

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,200
that you do on a day to day basis you

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,750
know it takes time to learn something

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,790
you can work it into your into your jobs

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,200
so you know if you want to take some

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,789
time to do it that's great if you have

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:37,160
options to do it at your own pace so as

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:41,129
a journalism student you know I was

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,509
really interested about to see the demo

00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,989
because it reminded me of something that

00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:48,449
came out with an Iowa study which was

00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:50,819
snowfall so if you have worked in dental

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,659
media before you may have heard the term

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:57,089
- snowfall and so that sort of came

00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,909
about at 2012 when the New York Times

00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:03,149
released this really awesome a media

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:05,039
piece called snow and you know I was a

00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:07,379
plucky journalism students and and it

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,289
just been really exciting that we could

00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,839
keep in depth reporting and turn it into

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:17,069
a microsite like this that walked you

00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:20,879
through how by makuu of the stories the

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:23,189
New York Times done this really invested

00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,499
on an avalanche we've done we published

00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:29,729
and they integrated all of these maps

00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:32,490
and these contracted videos and these

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,379
storytelling elements that really

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,779
changed the way that a lot of people

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:39,569
thought about storytelling online it

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,589
opened up all these new ways of

00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:47,279
presenting people and encouraging people

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,879
to really engage with content in a new

00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,369
way

00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,649
in fact after it was released and in

00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:56,969
within six days had 3.5 million

00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:59,069
pageviews 2.9 million visitors nearly a

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,829
third of whom had never visited the time

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,950
- website before so from industry that

00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:07,230
was like on the decline journalist

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,840
you know news having a third of your

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,850
visitors being newcomers to your website

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,800
it's kind of a big coup in a lot of a

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,050
lot of newsrooms were then catching on

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,520
to this trend putting out their own

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,130
versions of this and so that's when we

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,230
started having things like are we going

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,990
to know all this story or what are we

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,940
going to do a snowfall I mean in fact it

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,510
one leg up with surprise and a Peabody

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,580
Award

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,070
and a lot of people say it's courts have

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,680
changed digital media and news reporting

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,900
in forever so I did a bit of research

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,080
about the technical specs of snowfall

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,720
and of course a lot of it is jQuery back

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,000
in 2012 the team that developed this

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,240
that what they use some photo slideshows

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,660
that they already use for other projects

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,430
underscore J planner these html5 video

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,860
jQuery real and address and some

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,360
triggers for with events of the two

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,480
inspiration from the primitive career

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,930
plugin so yeah so with Guttenberg I

00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,520
would say that anyone can snowfall now

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,190
that we have all these tools built in

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,320
right into WordPress it's not easier for

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,530
just the ordinary person to integrate

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,830
all these videos images and to really

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,950
bring your content to life without

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,110
having a newsroom full of professional

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,230
digital

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,940
and the designers so I think it's really

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,710
exciting it's really exciting time and

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm gonna walk you through some of the

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,630
features that you can in scoober to do

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,010
some things to learn snowfall or adapt

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,810
it to whatever it is you're doing with

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,660
your lover whether you run your own

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,850
business website or whether you are

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,420
working for an agency all of these tools

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,060
can be applied to your content so let's

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,160
take a look at Gutenberg just trying to

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,540
get go so if you take a look at the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,910
right-hand bar there you have your

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,680
document toolbar and a lot of that is

00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,720
going to be super similar to the stuff

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,690
that you've seen in the current editor

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,990
so you have your status and visibility

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,910
the publish date all of those settings

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,070
that you need to set for your page of

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,140
your books before you publish you know

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,690
have your featured image and your

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,330
discussion and sharing all of that

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,090
that's already built in they also have

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,070
the block tab and the block tab comes

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,100
alive because Gutenberg is designed

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,410
around these block elements so if you

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,450
hover over the main text area you'll see

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,000
a little plus button and you can start

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,340
adding these lost and a menu will appear

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
that you can search and I got pretty

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,790
good at searching because there's so

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
many options but I kind of like

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,940
developed my own favorite ones

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,410
so those most used ones come to the top

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,900
and really other ones you can just

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:47,840
search them back to work so when you had

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,730
a block all of a sudden the block to

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,740
learn on the side pops up and you can

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,170
control each individual block whether it

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,220
protect an image a short code all the

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,180
different

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,310
they have their own set of pendulum and

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,170
controls that you can view the so that's

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,120
a really exciting way that you can start

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,259
thinking and laying out your content

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,420
because you're going to be able to

00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,420
fine-tune and control every single one

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,899
of those pieces keep in mind that

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,209
because a lot of this stuff but some of

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,930
it does depend on your theme you may

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,220
have some blocks up here that other

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,470
websites that you manage don't have so

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,750
for example I have a field SEO built

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,660
into our and I have it on one of my

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,189
websites and so in Gutenberg I cannot a

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,370
couple of blocks that are generated by

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:36,019
us which are some structured data look

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,730
so depending on what Logan's you have

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,620
and how your theme this advice you may

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,079
have a couple decoctions for a couple of

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,199
us options but generally speaking these

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,639
are some of the main blocks and I put

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:50,000
them into a couple of categories like

00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,930
text styling media quotes has its own

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,689
because there's a lot of different

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,199
options on how to manage both layouts

00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:58,759
and your classic code books so these are

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:03,829
a lot of the options that you can use to

00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:06,350
start defining your own so let's get

00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:08,540
right into it because this is the bulk

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,629
of the presentation right you want to

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,790
know okay here are these options but is

00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,589
it really that important to me or simply

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,110
that useful to me I just want to get

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:20,149
some text on a page but really what I

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,309
hope to accomplish today is to inspire

00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:23,959
you to show you if you were scared about

00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,000
couldn't forget first just to show you

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,590
how

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,290
the tools that's available to you and

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:32,650
what you can do to implement it into

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,140
your workflows so the first tip that I

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,970
have is use Guttenberg to add style to

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,010
your text this one's kind of being like

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,240
a no-brainer everyone wants to add a

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,770
little bit of style to their text

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,300
finding for a long time we had options

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,400
like italics not on your school

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,260
underlying has been bold and you could

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,150
control your headings you could change

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,700
the colors and if you wanted to get into

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,500
CSS if you do a lot more than that but

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,800
now you can sort of do it without having

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,050
to go outside of the editor and you can

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,330
add a lot of different interesting

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,280
elements that will stylize your text so

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,080
whether that's just your basic paragraph

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,440
that you want to work with a full quote

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,400
now you can actually use Collins and

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,900
Guttenberg which is super awesome you

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,000
don't have to like hand code that or

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,310
anything or depending on your themes to

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,860
provide that kind of styling you can go

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,660
ahead and add columns of text yourself

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,930
you can stylize your verses your quotes

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,940
you can kind of really advance less

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,580
anything control the heading thing you

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,860
use and your sub headers because one of

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,200
the things that I like to recommend to

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,630
people is don't just dump text on page

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,060
no one wants to engage with that it's

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,490
really scary to have a long long bit of

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,280
text but it's a lot easier to engage

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,830
with if you have spacing if you have

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,630
diversity in the type of text layout

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,700
that you have and so those visual grace

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,580
also allowed for a higher

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,700
and by using book quotes you can also

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,900
decide what salient people are going to

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,550
retain from your content and what

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,160
they're going to do what they're going

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,310
to remember when they leave the page so

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,680
in Bloomberg again everything is built

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,180
like up so here we have some text

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,660
elements and I just sort of dumped a

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:16,640
bunch of them on the page but but you

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,730
can see pretty much what's on the page

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,580
here you have a couple of columns and

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:28,940
and some pulpo's and yeah see this is

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,190
just like a diverse group ahead and so

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,440
did a lot of possibilities by decra spam

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,690
your text you can do a drop cap the

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,580
columns like I said and somewhere we can

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,390
pull quotes just to diversify what's

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,390
available to you

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,670
and here was a burst in your last life

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,980
head first

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,589
yeah so a person being probably a quote

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,329
from a book or from some other source

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,699
that you want stylized a little bit

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:59,870
differently something that breaks apart

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:01,879
from your regular text the next one is

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,800
images this one's also kind of the new

00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,949
we think about what's on our page we

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,540
have text that we have images now even

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,399
where we have a lot more options for our

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,949
images so whatever you want to do like a

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,439
full screen images with a couple of

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:19,040
galleries before we just have to a lot

00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:23,509
have a couple of galleries bunch of

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,970
plugins and then things like you know

00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:27,350
Brett justified in the Genesis text all

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,480
of that would take a lot longer to

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,040
design you wouldn't always get the

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,139
result that you want when you look at a

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,019
calendar so we've got kind of

00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,819
complicated for just the AdWords user to

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:41,149
really put what they had in their mind

00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:43,850
onto the page so with Guttenberg you can

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,379
have you know just images but you have a

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,810
lot more options on how to style them

00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:49,220
some gallery options cover image which

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,759
is a really cool tool that you can use

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,860
to add an image add a color overlay and

00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,839
add text great long as we image without

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,839
having to use with their current or

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,490
so and then you call so we have a lot of

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,140
options for envis so if you just want to

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,149
go pull something from Instagram also

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,740
think from Flickr you can do it right in

00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:12,140
your editor and you can just copy and

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,390
paste directly and it'll generate a kind

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,050
of just like that so but defensively

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,149
fact element to to storytelling and

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,649
adding images and I also have a

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:25,209
screenshot of something that kind of

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,209
looks like a surface

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I believe you still have to click on it

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,760
yeah

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,830
I would test it out anything so I have a

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,570
screenshot here of you know these four

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,850
blocks because one of the cool things

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,850
that people do with galleries is use

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,620
them to design being buttons you know a

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,890
lot of people want to create websites

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,830
that have very visually striking and

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,390
ways to interact with links and if you

00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,040
want to have like a display of different

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,500
services but you don't want to just be

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,630
boring text links you can use a gallery

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,060
to then add interlinks and create a

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,820
really tiny unique way of displaying

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,890
your services or maybe linked to other

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,230
blog posts that you've categorized and

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,210
however you decide to do it you can use

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,100
the gallery now to do it really easily

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:22,670
and seamlessly so number three is to

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,700
integrate other types of post types so

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,220
that sounds like a Muay Boran but

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,430
playing with Gutenberg I realized that

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,170
when people engage with your content

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,850
oftentimes you as an author you want

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,770
them to stay on your website as sending

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,290
this somewhere else so whether it's

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,520
related content stuff this blog post or

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,230
whether there's an action that you want

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,740
them to take after engaging with your

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,850
content

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,380
climbing up registering for an event or

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,010
downloading an e-book or whether you

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,480
know going

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,670
an e-commerce story that you have

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,200
related to your website all of these

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,720
actions are things that you want people

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,700
to do right after they engage with your

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,590
content not later you want them to stand

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,750
on their website as much as possible and

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,850
what human verb does is make it super

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,430
easy to pull all of that content into

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,200
one page and then you can design an

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,970
experience for your customers or your

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,280
readers when they come onto your website

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,020
they can read your text but you know if

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,330
you want them to continue reading you

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,610
can then pull all of the plain content

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,290
and display it using short codes which

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,840
we were able to do before but now it's a

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,790
little bit more intuitive and to also

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,810
show different content to the category

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:33,260
you can also display archives you can

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:35,360
post and you can also ask idols so if

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,160
you are sharing information about an

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,390
event you want people to download a

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,400
registration form an e-book or some

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,620
guidelines anything that's there the PDF

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,150
Doc's are going like that you don't have

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,910
to send them into another part of the

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,770
website you don't have to link in a very

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,050
uniform way you can actually start

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,000
building these pages that have a little

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,310
bit more interest so this is a snapshot

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,080
of the editor side so here what I've

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,590
done is I've just used a shortcode to

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,990
show poor homeopath entries because

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,089
that's another thing

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,579
we are post types like post but we also

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,079
have the basic ones like portfolio and

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,260
testimonials which we can use short

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,699
posts to control and so by using trip

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,010
codes we can display them YouTube

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:21,010
thumbnail or not we can put them into

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,260
columns and then around that using some

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,199
of the new bridge blocks we can also add

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,929
content that we stylized to men to

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,669
support those those tacos that we've

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,860
created so whether we want to get people

00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,860
to engage in a certain way to create

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,720
call to actions or recommendations and

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,390
we can also create this Bellini buttons

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,190
and link to other parts of our website

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,990
in a very engaging and a very

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,520
encouraging way so you know on the front

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,529
end with kind of like this book I have

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,270
the two posts but I went and generating

00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,340
with my shortcode and then I have a link

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,929
to our articles and then I have a link

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,149
to about five so this was a very

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:00,429
rudimentary example of how you can start

00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:02,380
building landing pages that do exactly

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:04,480
what you want to do will have exactly

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,250
the content that you want put together

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,830
for the experience you're trying to

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:13,929
create for your readers and so that's

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,460
just another way to really define

00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,600
different

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:23,260
and not have to use a bunch of plugins

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,289
to do it number four is to add

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,570
multimedia again storytelling a lot of

00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,789
it is visual so like in the snowfall

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,950
example using the maps that are

00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:35,350
attractive gifts somewhat interactive

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,270
please not the best show same gifts

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,970
videos all these things that add a

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,980
little bit of interest to your content

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,919
now remember you can just do it by

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,200
adding a block and so I mean these are

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,029
just the basic one audio and video but

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,399
if you type in video into the Guttenberg

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:54,039
swap selector you'll also have options

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,080
to amend from YouTube permitting for

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,090
audio you can invest in Spotify and all

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,760
sorts of other third-party services and

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,600
so you know in a pavement of having a

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,039
really diverse and interesting

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,870
interesting experience because you've

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,880
gone and pulled content different

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,370
sources and you've prepped it exactly

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,890
the content that you'd like to present

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,320
so different media services are being

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,380
added to the list all the time so it

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,500
kind of looks like this

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,750
once you embed an image or started a

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,630
video or audio you also have a whole

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,809
bunch of different controls that appear

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,610
and so on the side that you have you

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,720
know autoplay and loop and you know

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,970
someone has too much developing

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,830
Instagram I'm not sure about that but

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm you know for uploads that are

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,100
directly from your WordPress

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,920
installation you do have the ability to

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,360
control how that videos gonna play so if

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,460
someone's scrolling down your page and

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,990
you want a video to autoplay then you

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,600
can control that experience now another

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,059
way that Pittsburgh has made it easier

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,940
for people to create exactly the kind of

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,490
pages that they want is that they have

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,550
some tools to add breathing and I think

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,890
people underestimate the importance of

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,320
white space when you're designing a page

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,130
or when your content creator because you

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,990
want your page to breathe the content

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,900
and you want them to understand the flow

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,870
of what you're presenting and you know

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,900
before we have to do heart returns or go

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,670
into HTML and not refuse basis and then

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,920
those would never stay or they're do is

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,470
be your problem we're trying to edit the

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,970
content

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,169
and they wouldn't say we're layout these

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,960
were some of the headaches that we

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,640
happen and we're mentoring users and now

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,190
the Gutenberg you know those are built

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,419
in so you can create columns which allow

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,940
you to organize your text in different

00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:46,179
ways you can add tables without having

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,980
to hand code them and you can you know

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,950
create different ways of managing your

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,470
content that allowing your br-2 to not

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,600
be overwhelmed and to have a brief you

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,750
know pay attention or female page breaks

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,059
so people can even split up your content

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,950
in a way that is that makes sense you

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,440
have different different themes people

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,090
going to be dismembered me and you can

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,710
also have spacers which is just another

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,419
or not making space to have an extra

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,390
space but you don't have to hand code

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:15,640
yourself the more tag and the separator

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:24,730
tag so these are all ways to add space

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:27,429
to your content and the last one but the

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:31,330
last one is to build in a call to action

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:33,039
I think people will think of cost

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,880
actions as the orange button that's been

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:39,190
fine now but even right but even even

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,890
just your typical blog uses like the

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,840
call to action idea in different ways so

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,240
when you ask people to continue reading

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,340
sort of a call to action people ask them

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,570
to subscribe or to check out your

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,890
related articles you know these are all

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,490
wasting want people to engage with your

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,639
website

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,159
- maybe to make a decision to keep the

00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:02,200
evening with it so call to actions with

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,809
Gutenberg of course we have our funding

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:14,049
book which is a super cool tool that you

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:15,940
can use but we do have the bundle block

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,399
which is a really neat way that you can

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,220
just choose a button and choose the

00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:22,629
color she was how it's designed and all

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,070
of that is it's gonna be seamless we've

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:26,499
done the ranking Gutenberg you don't

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,470
have to get the CSS but when used to

00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:31,600
have to you don't have to copy it and

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,029
find the color except you met your needs

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,529
or through advance code you can just go

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:46,980
ahead and build your your button and

00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:46,980
it'll stay right in your content yeah

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,299
anyway all my friends are gonna be

00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:04,799
available so you can take a look at

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:07,210
these videos I will tweet out today and

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,629
start playing around with it yourself so

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,399
this is just me one of the cool things

00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:16,389
they'd be picked up also as they show

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:18,110
you an accessibility so if your color

00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,240
combination is not

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,620
it will give you a warning sign so if

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,540
you're trying to do let black and our

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,730
friend or say this is impossible to read

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,309
please fix it you're gonna have to get a

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:31,130
couple you can set your adjustments like

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,780
the different types and that's just an

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:36,170
easy way but I use that all the time

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,910
whether it's read more or you know

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,860
sometimes I travel blog I think to other

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,330
things and all I'll use a button because

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,280
it just makes a little bit more friends

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,070
me but there's other tolling Guttenberg

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,059
that you can use to evoke the similar my

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,380
call to action yes so you can do the

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,940
pulp okay that's the one that you want

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,340
to do to draw attention to certain

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,290
action or draw attention to an idea you

00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,750
can use a full quote and doesn't have to

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,850
be poked you can use it to to say

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:05,090
something encouraging like to join it

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,669
today and also you can control the color

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,460
like I said the other thing is to use an

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:12,679
image so instead of having to design

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,570
your image outside of goober but can

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,460
better or something you can just build

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,650
it right into Gutenberg so you pick your

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,200
image from your media library we must

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:24,230
know something and with the tools you

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,910
can then add color over it you can add

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,130
text over at min all of sudden it

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:32,590
because it's we need self-contained

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,590
little call-to-action button that

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,000
and speaking of reusing your blocks

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,470
that's one of the really awesome things

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,650
about Greenberg expect if you've spent

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:48,190
all this time designing a cool contactin

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,650
you know likely to stop then you can

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,049
save it and it will be saved in your

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,490
favorite for ever and you can use it on

00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:57,940
your different pages on your different

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,590
blog posts and it will always have and

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,539
that's especially useful if you have a

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,190
multi author blog for your managing the

00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:05,350
website for their multiple people

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,179
contributing you can go ahead and ask

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,580
your design team to design a few blocks

00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,980
that follow your branding guideline and

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,230
then we stays in to be your favorites

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,840
and then whoever uses that website can

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,299
then go into your doober blocks you can

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,640
name it something separate and they'll

00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,740
be able to reuse that lock whether it's

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,880
like a call to action or if it's

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:34,090
something with a shortcode again all

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:36,660
these blocks we can save this is an

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:40,240
example pretty cheap

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,670
but the idea is there it's just that you

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,950
doesn't wrinkle it yourself and it's

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:55,760
going to be there for you to read

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:57,680
I love the question but it suddenly went

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,990
out there looking weird is that using

00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,450
the stylizing test to add images to

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,910
maximize the post type you have with

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,660
your blog or on their website to add

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,460
audio and video and dynamic multimedia

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,830
to add a space you make things

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,410
breathable add a call to action whether

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,760
that's like a direct action or with a

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,950
link or an idea

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,050
and you can also create these reusable

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:35,000
books so that your website is always

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:37,430
consistent okay remember to following

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,930
entry actor and their injuries on her on

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,810
Twitter she will be tweeting out home

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,210
the videos from her presentation you can

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,790
also go to the war camp website and go

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:51,280
to your schedule and you'll see all the

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,280
slides for all of the center's so much

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,609
mine actually isn't a question I just

00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:07,039
wanted to say for anyone who hasn't seen

00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:09,619
snow coal what that is about is the huge

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,609
avalanche that took out it was in this

00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:14,629
in store plumbing so it's about a local

00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,489
thing from ten years ago

00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:36,440
it's Tola it's still up on the web and

00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:39,379
it's totally worth watching disrupt that

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,960
flow and force you to create a new

00:27:39,379 --> 00:28:04,639
paragraph every time you want to type a

00:27:41,960 --> 00:28:07,580
new traditional you decided want to put

00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:09,920
an image inside of one of those then is

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,539
it easy enough to split up

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,739
[Music]

00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,679
because you have the option to change

00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:17,330
regular or if you are opening up

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:45,349
something on the designs using the

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:51,379
original editor so you said to be

00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:54,039
looking to save are those available for

00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:54,039
anyone

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,510
who has certain level of permission so I

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,220
think if they're an author and they're

00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,920
allowed to use it but I think that we're

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,380
all gonna kind of how you set up or in

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,690
your outfit I would play around with my

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,270
experience so far has been that if it

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,620
states to me in in your WordPress

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:26,140
installation anyone who's an author

00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:26,140
should be able to okay anybody else

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,950
kind of related to that question the a

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,390
lot of all those choices remind me of

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,790
the old I will not remember the

00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,770
introduction of desktop publishing in

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,690
the ensuing amateurish layouts and

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,330
powers like things like that are there

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:47,300
sort of the admin controls that give

00:29:44,330 --> 00:30:14,860
different levels of access to these

00:29:47,300 --> 00:30:19,510
tools to different users and then I get

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:25,040
one different theme per slide these

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,600
rankings my presentations only off but I

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,570
think there's probably going to be

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,160
either some development or somebody

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,770
that's going to allow people to just

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:36,760
lock down with options I don't know that

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,760
it is yes but I'm sure

00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:52,660
here I was just curious if there were

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,910
any specific tools in Gutenberg for

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,120
integrating maps into like blog posts

00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:01,390
and things like that well we have the

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,610
classic HTML block so anything that's

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,270
coded in HTML you can easily just embed

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:09,730
right in there I think a lot of again

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,290
it's so early that you know I think

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,250
there's a lot of plug-in developers that

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:17,230
are probably going to be playing around

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:19,480
too

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,950
so if there are some cold up there 30

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,200
exists for math Conservation's for

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,240
example it may not be very long before

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,920
that's designed for the Newburgh and

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:33,400
where that becomes the block bringing

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:36,390
everything in from third parties but

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,390
there might be some other more

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:53,050
the Gutenberg realm okay it's on your

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,050
time and the other questions

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,020
all right well thank you Andrea

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,980
