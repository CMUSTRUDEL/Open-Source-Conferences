Publication date: 2020-04-15
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Modern development is complex, with lots of tools to turn the code we write into the code used by the user’s browser. This can be as simple as minifying assets or as sophisticated as downloading dependencies, turning source code into production code, and running automated tests.
In this session, we will look at the top benefits gained from adopting automation and testing to optimize workflow. Whether you’re a developer wondering why you should try automation in the first place or a business owner wondering why you should let your team spend time on adopting a new process when the current one “just works” we’ll have answers for you!
