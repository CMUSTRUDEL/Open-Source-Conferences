If so, join award-winning Sarasota, Florida, author and editor Liz Coursen for this fun, fast-paced workshop that will have you writing like an Einstein in no time flat!

	00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,750
so several years several years ago

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,400
Sarasota author and editor Liz whoreson

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,619
really likes her County Library System

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,470
was throwing away perfectly good books a

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,540
lot of good and so after trying and

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,270
failing to convince inflation told how

00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,980
to distribute these books she partnered

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,290
with other counties private individuals

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,599
and today has given away more than

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,239
fifteen thousand books to homeless and

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,770
needy people in her community an

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,630
enthusiastic commuter and lifelong

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,570
advocate for Lindsay this is here to

00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,129
talk to us about right right right now

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,670
say that ten times fast

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:47,379
right right right now so these and

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,679
gentlemen help me give a warm welcome to

00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,679
this

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,859
what was not said just now is that one

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,229
of the pivotal points of my book

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:05,619
giveaway to homeless people in my

00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:09,009
Sarasota for our community was one day I

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:11,710
was in a dumpster and I had figured out

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:14,080
the dumpster routes of all the libraries

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,610
in the county and I've go near the date

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,240
before

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,830
the dumpsters were empty Ron ran and I

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,460
start looking for the books that I was

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,950
going to save rescue and giveaway and I

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,049
try to be subtle about it I tried to do

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,360
it sort of off hours but one building

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,840
right during the middle of the day I

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,630
found myself in a dumpster at the main

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,030
library downtown Sarasota Florida and

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,030
the security guard emailed to me he said

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,409
listen he says the next time you are in

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:55,810
a dumpster we're going to have you

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:58,420
arrested for trespass and I said for the

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,179
county library system then you are

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:06,099
arresting a middle-aged lady who feels

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:10,090
compelled to jump in your dumpsters and

00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,720
rescue discarded books and so I said

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,810
this is

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,600
and this problem I called the only

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,130
person I know that could help me

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,710
publisher of the Sarasota Herald Tribune

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,440
I said I gotta tell you that the library

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,350
is throwing boy books and he said come

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,350
on pretending reporter and so he came

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:33,040
over to supporter at 17 boxes of

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:37,420
children's biographies mostly of African

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,650
American leaders so imagine probably had

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:46,200
was 437 of these children's biographies

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:49,270
of Martin Luther King jr. Rosa Parks

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,620
luminaries like that and these have been

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:57,580
thrown away that had been in a dumpster

00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,760
and once the article hit the paper I'm

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,960
glad to say that the library stopped

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,790
throwing away books but did they give

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:13,120
them to me no now all of us are parently

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,420
sent off to someplace in Indiana where I

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,489
guess they're resold and so there was no

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,060
leadership about that particular issue

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:26,230
than my County one of the ways you can

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,340
really demonstrate leadership is by good

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:33,370
writing your good writing demonstrates

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:38,290
Authority and credibility I'm going to

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,950
show you today how to make $250 who

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,170
among us would like to have an extra

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,989
$250 see some people think you don't

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,640
really care but I know that I would like

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,640
to have an extra $250

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm not talking about $250 I'm not

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,590
talking about $250 a month I'm not

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:07,740
talking about $250 a week a day or an

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:12,270
hour I'm not even talking about $250

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,350
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:22,810
$250 a second now who among us wouldn't

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:55,510
be like to make $250 a second that's why

00:04:22,810 --> 00:05:00,600
well there's yes okay I'm here today to

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:06,700
talk about punctuation and grammar I

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:09,220
have 47 style guides in my library 47

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,990
different publishers who have said this

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,490
is the way needed semicolon this is a

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,900
way to use a comma this is the

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,479
difference between a punch of a - inna -

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:23,890
but I will combine the three authorities

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:27,630
the New York Times Chicago and Bleeker

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,630
not Princeton University

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:38,540
an academic side is unassailable if you

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,410
use the style I have blended from these

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,860
three stories you can go toe-to-toe with

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,960
the grammar need in your office you can

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,420
go toe-to-toe with any grammar geek

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,010
psychic as clients because the full

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,150
month of the twenty sheriff's morning

00:05:52,010 --> 00:06:00,430
are absolutely non-dimensional it's fast

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:06,070
workshop I want you all to think about

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:09,470
I want you to think about fundamentals

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:13,070
the Serena's case the fundamentals are

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,170
tennis I guarantee you that minute

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,570
Serena Williams first stepped on a board

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:21,110
he did not care and did not question

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,450
about the width of the court the height

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:38,030
of the net

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:41,510
I would entertain every question that

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:47,780
you have except for one and that

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:50,750
question is why why who knows why who

00:06:47,780 --> 00:07:00,770
cares why because this is just like

00:06:50,750 --> 00:07:03,980
playing tennis so just relax you're

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,020
going to take a quiz but it's merely a

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,190
disagreement through cheat this mark

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:14,110
please 21 seconds quiz number one it is

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:19,330
designed to ferret out what you know

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,330
what you don't know and bring us

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,470
around food that you're not sure about

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,690
because it's my expectation that when

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,110
you walk out this door this morning you

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,850
will know you will know for sure I want

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,520
you to recognize these basic principles

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,130
and I'm also hoping at the end of this

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,930
workshop we will think like an editor

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:46,660
that's really my goal here

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,180
this step is easy it's done it's basic

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,460
this stuff should take you about three

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:57,640
minutes to go through this sheet it's

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,080
all easy it's all obvious and I don't

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,910
want you to leave them on anything

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,080
because there's nothing tricky about

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,370
this quiz absolutely nothing so I want

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:16,710
you to go through this I'm going to ask

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:16,710
for three minutes right now

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:29,689
if you come to a place where you're not

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:34,720
sure just so quiet underline it this is

00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:34,720
all stuff that y'all should learn

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,780
anybody need 30 more seconds right hands

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,780
30 more seconds

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,170
well my introduction it's a published

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:55,510
ten books about American English

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,310
punctuation grammar best practices so I

00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,860
can answer any questions

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,680
boy you asked with any questions that

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,380
aren't about tennis we can take it out

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,990
in the hall afterwards because we have

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,700
got a very specific agenda one of those

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,590
proverbial long way to go to get there

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,080
so let's get started with sentence

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,390
number one you'll notice that there is

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,930
sort of a need to these questions and to

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:27,000
these sentences and yes they all are

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,110
WordPress developer website sentences

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,050
unfortunately are simple to go on a

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,850
wordpress developer site and pick out

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,770
the United States so here we go

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,370
I've been working with WordPress since

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:42,070
it's a chef in session number one the

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:45,220
state in American English its IT

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,230
apostrophe s verses by T best I think

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,270
this in the state all the time and I

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,430
have to slow myself down when I get to I

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,280
team s which is I can't possibly mess

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,250
I'm the apostrophe s is a detraction it

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,780
is what it has it's counterintuitive in

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,580
American English which is why you have

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,080
to go slow because you automatically

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,180
when you do a possessive with it

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,410
you put that apostrophe in there you

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,270
gotta watch yourself

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,520
you've gotta watch yourself fortunately

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,160
you do spell check and word it is a blue

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,410
line so watch those blue lines but watch

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,930
yourself is this is a huge mistake it's

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:22,330
a very mistake and it should not be made

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:25,840
by anybody at this level number two in

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,550
American English I want to focus on this

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,760
a little bit because we seem to have

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,910
fallen into error in American English

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,520
the noun drives the bus a singular noun

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,580
and we to see

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,600
who needs a senior from now that's true

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:47,040
in Britain people who write in British

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:53,160
English they have all by the wayside but

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,660
last time I looked so let's be careful

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,430
that we are writing an American English

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,550
or American audience

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,280
so sentence number two if it's a person

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,670
singular person singular percent is not

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,430
enthused about what they are doing

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:11,190
no it's here sheep remember in the 60s

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,740
if you are here with Natalia in the 60s

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,320
women went into the workforce in droves

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:39,240
used to be that even assume that when

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:41,040
you have particularly I'm making my

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,560
position pretty clear because I do not

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,230
feel like we have you don't have

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,560
boyfriends or 20 of workarounds to this

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,630
issue and there's so many times that the

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,270
newspapers would want to try to use that

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,250
this is this is a really in the weeds

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,380
question and it is controversy and I'm

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,840
just telling you this is my position

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:05,130
singular noun say new pronoun that's it

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,050
that's all that's it that's all yes

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:12,950
ma'am

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:14,540
I see that in technical writing and

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,250
future technical writing I guess I might

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,110
give you a pass but if you're writing

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,260
content on the internet that's made for

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,870
the masses I would definitely want to

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,079
see he or she now however here we have

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,250
if the person is not enthused about if

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:33,709
people are not is is that that's easy

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,660
that workaround is easy so comes up we

00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:38,959
don't have options to make this work in

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,339
American English so we have yeah if the

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,890
person's not enthused about what they

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,310
are doing wrong it will come through in

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,720
their content so we have two pronouns in

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,870
the second set of both wrong I

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,760
personally PluralEyes people to a person

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,279
here because I hate to see a sentence

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,200
that said his or her camera she here she

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,649
in the same sentence that would really

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,589
be absolute overload so that's easy that

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,470
we run is so simple so we have a we have

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:11,570
several sentences about this google who

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:14,360
the last time I looked it cannot be a

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,910
bad I don't care what the Supreme Court

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,770
says that company is it and that's all

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,860
there goes so the Google changes its

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,050
search algorithms the rest of the

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,820
sentence is fine but Google is not that

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:31,040
it is not about is not now and here we

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,310
get into some weeds here so follow me

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,720
there is an exception to this rule

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,950
actually it sort of but not only

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,240
exception is incorrect

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:44,360
they call collective nouns you are an

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,960
audience but audience is treated as a

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:52,610
singular now a singular noun so let's

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:55,730
look at four and five our team our team

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,380
Eva seed or now you don't have to worry

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,390
about what follows team because you've

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:04,250
led with team that is your man

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:07,579
our team provides our team provides is

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:12,530
not provide our team provides web

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:15,320
analytics five this will help us provide

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:18,410
our audience with the focus of each

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:22,339
presentation so that now

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,199
this is dicey it's really hard to in my

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,420
opinion is for disrespectful to the

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,160
common group of people of it which is

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:33,110
technically correct so I would say is

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,690
this will help us provide our audience

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:39,160
in that first number to forum their

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,770
problem there also you can use listeners

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,880
participants we have workarounds we have

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,870
workarounds here

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:53,270
but audience team staff are all

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:56,120
collective nouns they're active now and

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:59,420
have eyes elicit up your team I use room

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,280
staff urgent committee so these are

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,280
collective nouns watch out for them

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,280
because they will trip you up number six

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,710
you know it's it's actually assumed

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,050
because it was in this in the previous

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,880
sentence so I apologize I could not have

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,160
that previous sentence in there so

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,310
whatever this is has been discussed and

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,590
clarified in the previous sentence you

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,290
know I do it to our workshop without the

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,450
properties of commas so don't get me

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,090
started without commas but there is one

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,890
step the concept write to me all the

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,010
time I thought was worthy of a theory

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,260
brief discussion here very brief number

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,080
six susan has been covered by the way

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,670
I've changed all the names so please

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,050
don't google these sentences and think

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,000
you're going to come up with Susan in

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,740
Huntsville because you won't they're all

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,640
changed they're all change I want to

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,200
talk you're not trying to embarrass

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,650
anybody I'm trying to actually just

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,350
educate Susan has been a web developer

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,780
since 2005 and listen Huntsville Alabama

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:08,380
where she used the code word eyes are

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:10,090
like working in Huntsville got to got to

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,250
got to got to that's in the middle of

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,860
sentence it means a comma

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,690
and needs a period but you can't have at

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,760
the name of the city in the

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:24,660
corresponding state without that state

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,660
having a comma as well yes sir

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:36,750
I know because of where is your

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,750
conjunction and you're just repeating

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,790
Susan with the shape so I would just do

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:54,050
the how we have a common where she is

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:56,160
the fourth Susan after Susan you know

00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:03,690
all you use that won't come after

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:06,330
Alabama and they're good you know yeah

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,980
this is why I go to our workshop about

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,809
highness because you can never actually

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,760
put all of my situation marks in

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,830
American English you look out a

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,420
conversation about commas I'm not trying

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,220
to have a conversation about anything

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,940
here because I'm telling what this is

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,940
yes ma'am

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,360
if you if you change if you change

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,340
subjects you definitely need to have a

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,000
comma plus conjunction or a seminar

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,950
semicolon but I will at the end this is

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,840
this is a place where we can have a

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,840
conversation we have a discussion about

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,940
commas but the only comment I would put

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,650
in there requires editor is a comma

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:55,430
after Alabama but the rest of it doesn't

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:58,130
bother me okay okay never said that this

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,650
is a this is a real common mistake I saw

00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,810
actually this morning so don't drive

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:07,880
traffic to your website if it's not set

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:11,150
up in this situation that one word is

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,870
now we need the verb phrase

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,700
set there we go so that's the problem

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,190
with number stuff anybody seeing a bean

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,310
eater about our sentences remember

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,060
looking for correct sentences we're not

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,220
going to find any so keep keep going

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:31,310
number eight this is the number one

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,470
misspelled word in the Sarasota Multiple

00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,700
Listing Service and I wouldn't have any

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,410
doubt it's probably close to the top in

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,130
MLS as well the color scheme

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,620
complemented the logo oops this is the

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,170
wrong version of complement complemented

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,450
is

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,120
while with the iron metal and there's

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,250
one with it even though I give you a

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,010
trick to remember the to does this is

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,860
what the way I have to remember myself

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,560
complement with an aye-aye I say

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,450
something nice about you or the second

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,060
way to use compliment with an iron

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,380
middle is I buy lunch

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:12,090
your lunch is complimentary

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,500
now the other complement that we needed

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,390
in the sentence to make the sentence

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,750
correct is the compliment of EB the mill

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,680
and here's how can remember back to

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,460
complement with an e in the middle is to

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:30,740
be incomplete to complete so complete

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:34,350
and tricks riding on them all the time

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:41,570
number not work camps are locally

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:41,570
organized conferences never - 8 + ly

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:51,570
look to see if you're a pro cuts ly it

00:22:46,740 --> 00:23:00,500
does do not - that's a real common

00:22:51,570 --> 00:23:02,640
mistake but it's awesome to combine

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,940
technology and style

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,160
since when is technology or style a

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,840
proper noun no stop this stop this and

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,479
please please stop same awesome hair in

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,519
their work

00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:20,709
they're really very few things they're

00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,369
actually awesome to God mother nature

00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:25,249
nothing else

00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:28,820
so it's try to cut it starts mitigate

00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,239
their use of use of awesome is I'm over

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,429
it

00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:33,229
the technologies died style certainly

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:38,259
are not properly ouncer do need to be

00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:42,440
lower paced but some things need to be

00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:44,289
capitalized that aren't number 11 music

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,719
correct posture while doing Pilates

00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:50,719
exercise exercises improve safety the

00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:54,320
Pilates actually has to be a real person

00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:56,419
mr. Pilates and so if you write that

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,899
it's lower case that's not correct

00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:02,809
same thing with dumster same thing with

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:05,589
the xerox thing same thing with Weaver

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,289
not something you people who operate

00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:10,999
rolodex property hands so never was

00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:15,339
doing what was look things up so you're

00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:19,369
accurate and you're correct no 12

00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:21,200
number 13 well rotation mark series

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,999
although the board about quotation marks

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,219
on it I have said it would be straight

00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,529
this you all here in the room okay in

00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:30,469
American English the American English

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:34,549
quotation marks are always always place

00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:36,409
outside periods and commas there are no

00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:40,099
exceptions to this rule if you thinking

00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:42,169
man you have not you have nice there are

00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:44,719
no exceptions to this world so quotation

00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,159
marks outside periods of comments the

00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,679
placement of quotation marks with

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,389
semicolons and colons

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,820
always those are suppose countries you

00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,950
go outside the quotation marks and if

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,190
you come to a

00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:01,240
or question mark the placement depends

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:06,700
on the context and sentence really think

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:09,580
about oh but here quotation marks single

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,430
handles at WordPress performance of the

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,110
asking this question so remember quickly

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,300
not trying to go off the rails here none

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,270
of the said that you always leave

00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,880
America viewers with double quotes

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,260
British people with single quotes it's

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,330
one of the ways you can really tell

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,610
who's right in British English but here

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,220
we are right in for an American market

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:34,180
double quotes if you need to have a

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,340
quote inside your quotation marks single

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,350
quotes because punctuation remember it

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,360
is is return to communicate with the

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,670
reader you want your reader in this case

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,050
you know who's talking and when they

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,690
stopped talking and started putting

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:49,810
somebody else so double quotes you lead

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,950
with always and anything quoted

00:25:49,810 --> 00:26:00,870
inside those double quotes single quotes

00:25:52,950 --> 00:26:05,500
single quotes so these are not

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:07,870
rah-rah-rah the twelve the quotation

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,320
mark should be outside that period after

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:13,210
company and thirteen impossible layouts

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,370
that quotation marks you outside that

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:21,180
common another thing I want to say I'm

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,180
sure many people here furtive grammarly

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,180
grammarly

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm the brand early website brand really

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,590
sets that quotation works all these come

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,120
in pairs and hey on the surface of kind

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,600
of sound like you know they have to come

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,170
in pairs don't they of course no not at

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,960
all

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,700
take out any fiction novel that you

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,559
might have still sitting on your shelves

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,300
take a look at your fiction novels and

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,800
watch what happens when a character

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,330
speaks into a second paragraph because

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,000
when you have a character who speaks

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,429
into a second paragraph you do not in

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,720
quote at the end of that first paragraph

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,190
because you again you're trying to

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,600
communicate with your readers if you

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,120
want your readers to know that that same

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,520
person is speaking and continues to

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,010
speak and will continue to speak until

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,440
you put those in quotes on so grammerly

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,210
if you're listening need to change your

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,150
website because that is maybe correct

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:24,540
quotation marks do not always how many

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:26,370
pairs okay so so far batting zero with

00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,740
our correct sentence we have not been on

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,400
one yet I want to tell you a little bit

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,690
about telling time number 14

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,309
here's the problem with the sentence

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,620
there are two ways to tell the time

00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:40,320
correctly for expressed time correctly

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:50,190
in American English you can either use

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:52,410
lowercase a.m. p.m. and periods or no

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,170
periods those are the rules

00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:00,480
always have space between your number

00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:03,300
and a Murie the am/pm I also take off

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,620
the colon and the two zeroes at the top

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:11,370
of the hour so I'll say for space and

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,370
p.m. if it's 4:30 of course you can't do

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,280
that but I like my text

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,740
I mean I don't have anything in my tax

00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,559
that's extraneous so those are the rules

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,900
about am/pm so this one's wrong wrong

00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,170
wrong wrong

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,360
now we tell you a little bit easy way to

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,520
tell whether you need to use quotation

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,440
marks or italics I think I need this

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,270
rule up because I move it the other day

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,190
didn't find anything they also have to

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,860
got to take credit I call it the rule

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,250
pot so everybody imagine their favorite

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,380
flavor of hot there's a pot key lime pie

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,929
with graham cracker crust is my favorite

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,309
so I'm imagining that kind of sickly the

00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:56,600
name of the key line anything that can

00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:59,240
be sliced in the larger pie is good

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,090
interpretation marks the pie itself is

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,760
put into italics so I really enjoy

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,610
reading that New York Times article New

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,160
York Times is the pie the article is the

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,500
piece and then so the article title

00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,530
would have quotation marks New York

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,850
Times and italics are remain in

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:25,400
quotation marks my favorite on Joni

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:29,150
Mitchell's album Court and spark because

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:32,300
it can be sliced my favorite song Joni

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:35,840
Mitchell's album hornets bark is court

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:39,080
is our quotation marks so you just told

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,390
your audience that album title the

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:49,610
fourth spark but there's a song on the

00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:55,970
album so the pie is pieces quotation

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:58,040
marks so here here's somebody who says

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,100
he is the author of the international

00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,309
bestseller quote I fix the Internet

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:10,470
don't know the rules generally egos the

00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:11,780
size of the room at sixteen I need to

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,110
hire more people

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:19,230
eg a designer receptionist an account eg

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,890
and I eat always have periods and they

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,049
always are followed by a comp always

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,360
notice that British English people are

00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:29,940
pulling away from this rule again this

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,750
is America we are talking about American

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:39,630
English so sixteen needed a comma after

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:41,760
eg seventeen look stuff up you got what

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,039
stuff up I have no stuff up all the time

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,960
and I was approximately it or pop-ups

00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,520
about cancer and things like that

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,429
because I'm making up things for my

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,350
clients and a lot of them are simply

00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:55,590
type people and I have to look up all

00:30:52,350 --> 00:31:02,429
these type of things about cancer so if

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:04,140
I ever and ever looks at my my browsing

00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,840
history I'm probably in trouble

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,130
then anyway one in five right now the

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:14,220
rule about Wi-Fi is capital W by

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,400
lowercase I - capital passed lowercase I

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,919
that does the way why eyes express this

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,650
moment in time

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:26,760
18 I saw this on a wordpress site

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:31,159
WordPress capital W party capital P are

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:34,230
a best pass that to me is a mistake and

00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:36,870
WordPress is very plain about how it

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:41,130
wants to corporately be expressed in

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:43,710
writing 19 these in 1920 or stupid

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,049
stupid mistakes that somebody who just

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,419
look at their material before they print

00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:51,000
or publish these mistakes would have

00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,669
been found if you don't see any times

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,929
that works for you

00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:59,659
so obviously works should be work that's

00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:04,669
a big mistake

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:04,669
we're actively seeing those interesting

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:15,630
at work in you notice I put ABC I'm

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,700
actually applying to speak that work but

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,370
if you're taking anybody but yes that is

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:25,250
right on the internet right now that

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:28,470
sense all right

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,309
so now that one I promised you that

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,090
right

00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:34,399
hopefully not only educate your eye for

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,039
mistakes

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,380
help you think like an editor so what's

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,669
thinking like an editor this was

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:48,029
advertised as a twenty one sentence quiz

00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:51,360
but she I only see twenty substances

00:32:48,029 --> 00:33:04,049
where is the twenty first sentence who

00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:07,309
knows nobody read the instructions let's

00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:11,340
all read the instructions together put

00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:14,640
checkmark whoops one of the toughest

00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,580
things to spot when you're editing

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,390
content is the dreaded missing word oh

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,149
my gosh

00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,610
so put a checkmark next to all correct

00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:26,429
sentences that is the twenty first

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,860
sentence in this 21 seconds quiz

00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:32,640
none of these sentences are correct but

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,230
there's more but wait if you are looking

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,740
at this

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,990
we need this as a piece as a piece of

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:45,590
war product there are two types of fonts

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:47,419
in this quiz we have an old style which

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,340
is my favorite font and then we have

00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,380
some other thoughts on number four I

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,649
came through the name of that but anyway

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:58,309
it's different so I would deem somebody

00:33:54,649 --> 00:34:01,789
if this was a piece of work product by

00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:03,139
what looks like to me a mistake in using

00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,289
two kinds of fonts it does a little

00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:08,329
deliberate to me it looks like a mistake

00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:10,929
but there's one more thing one more

00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:14,149
thing now I'm at hazard a guess that

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,790
you'd like to say anything but the

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:18,470
formatting the four 90s - day don't

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,320
looking for metadata that's the base

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,389
after ten through twenty that's my fault

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,349
there's something else's quiz that's

00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,339
wrong wrong wrong wrong

00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:32,270
anybody want to hazard a guess about

00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:33,679
what it is Big Bob oh no no it's not

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,020
about the writers reamer these real

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,940
sentences so we're not not hacking up

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,879
these sentences here because this is

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:46,040
this is about persuasive grammar all

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,569
right yes you know that's my fault

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,210
no we're going to give me a pass on that

00:34:47,569 --> 00:35:02,770
sorry yes no it's about oops we should

00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:02,770
read yes no no all right all right

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,340
this is

00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,260
this is what you need to look at with

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:16,070
your editor yeah so I'm gonna take one

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,310
more what if you say put a checkmark

00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:29,110
wouldn't that get singular checkmark

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:29,110
versus well that's not it okay

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,239
[Music]

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,780
[Applause]

00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:43,440
this is an agent stick needs needs

00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:48,779
remain surely major mistake there are

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:51,809
two kinds there are two kinds of

00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:54,809
quantitation marvelous piece directional

00:35:51,809 --> 00:36:00,089
and non-directional quotation marks take

00:35:54,809 --> 00:36:02,999
a look at 12 and 13 see that and that's

00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:04,950
a major estate everybody you gotta use

00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:08,670
the same kind of quotation marks

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:15,660
throughout your content it must be it

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:18,690
must be it's against it gets pretty easy

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,569
it actually does but once you see these

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:27,059
things once you really see them and you

00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:31,019
know you just can't so everyone has a

00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:34,410
big sheet which is the second quiz and I

00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:36,420
think because of time constraints I can

00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,749
suggest that you take that and if you

00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:42,029
like to do it after the session I would

00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:44,099
suggest it with this census show that

00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:46,920
people who actually reinforcement

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:50,690
learning immediately upon the new

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:55,710
learning process retain the new learning

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:59,190
87% longer when New York is again so

00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:02,130
that pink sheet has nothing that we

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,749
didn't cover on this green sheet except

00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,910
I didn't mix it up I tried to clump

00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:08,640
stuff together and the green sheet is

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:10,589
make it easier to explain so and there

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,319
might be a sentence or two on the pink

00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:16,170
sheet that has more than one mistake in

00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:21,239
it but everything on the page sheet we

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:25,249
just cover this one I promised I would

00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,249
tell you how to make

00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:34,600
so imagine me in Sarasota Florida in a

00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:39,700
couple weeks time around Thanksgiving

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:44,440
I'm having to fit right so I'm a best

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:48,700
friend Sarasota and I read how people

00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:51,670
find me so I'm going to have my car this

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,170
is an early draft or what it might look

00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:25,990
like things have changed enormously

00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:30,940
since then everyone needs an enter so

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:34,290
how impressed you think I am this

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:42,880
company's what product when they wobble

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:47,020
my tagline they misspelled need it's

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,010
gotta be it's gotta be something I could

00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:55,080
take a little bit further and cross out

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,080
me and say me

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:09,870
at some point the buck has to stop so I

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,860
don't want anybody any kind of inkling

00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:21,270
that the editor might even enter now

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:25,050
these people did front back and both

00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:29,370
sides how long would you think that we

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:32,910
take one person to eyeballs to look over

00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:37,400
this one product before shipping it to

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:42,330
me it's a two thousand dollar job I

00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:46,710
calculate about eight seconds so this

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:50,030
company did make two thousand dollars

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:57,120
because the representative did not spend

00:39:50,030 --> 00:40:02,790
eight seconds because of that they lost

00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:05,910
my business we are in a huge competitive

00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:08,310
market I don't know how many web

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,590
developers and designers they are Chuck

00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,800
there are just in Metro Sarasota like

00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:16,170
that the woods are full of them so we

00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,720
have competition and it really makes

00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:22,650
sense for us to take those eight seconds

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,200
look over our work before innocent to

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,860
our clients and even after it's

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,590
published

00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,840
take a look at your work there are so

00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:35,610
many people who are telling us to hurry

00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,370
up get things done push it out but I

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,260
tell you that in this

00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:42,680
in his writing space in this edited

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,930
space you can achieve profession that

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,200
this perfection is the standard there is

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:51,890
no excuse for typos in the space on the

00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:55,400
internet content no excuse at all so I

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,830
want you all to drag your heels drag

00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,420
their eyeballs across your content and

00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,670
make sure that whatever you're putting

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,390
out is professional one product is

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:24,080
perfect this is a space where you can be

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:25,520
perfect perfect blend out of it because

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,050
there's no way we have enough time to do

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,050
that I can tell you right now yes ma'am

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,630
okay

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,609
I will pay up okay I have I have a goose

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,430
I had rusev livid an opinion which I

00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:52,049
will share about directional official

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,780
marks versus non direction which is what

00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:58,589
I call them so curly versus straight so

00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:02,700
directional non directional I like a

00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:04,470
curly quote in a novel I think it is

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,589
attractive to the eye

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:10,020
I like non directional in Internet

00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:14,220
content because I'll tell you why I had

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,700
a lot of novels and it is it just

00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,230
basically likes Lidia wrist if you have

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,970
an author who's gone through different

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,230
times and done directional and

00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,289
non-directional they ought to be the

00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:27,960
same and the problem is that a search

00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:30,150
will not reveal all these quotes for the

00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,250
search engines the search engine in your

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,559
in your one processor who's reading than

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:38,700
the same so you will have to go through

00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,200
the physically quotation work after

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,609
quotation mark and I'll tell you what a

00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,390
100 page a novel

00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:49,170
oh I'm not charging enough to do that so

00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:51,390
I like a non-directional an Internet

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:55,940
content there's something so charming

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,940
about directional quotation marks

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:12,510
We Need to Talk because my program

00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,290
doesn't do that it makes me do it by

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,390
myself

00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,250
so I'd love to I'd love to chat we'll

00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:30,840
figure out some technology and I need to

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:32,130
know about thank you okay yes and a lot

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,770
of times that would work if you're

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,720
working with a Navajo and and most of

00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,870
time a lot of times my white people have

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,790
come to me with that both kinds and it

00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,470
is you know what to try to go through

00:43:41,790 --> 00:44:00,060
and figure it out but this thing's gonna

00:43:43,470 --> 00:44:02,160
help okay thank you thank you yes yeah I

00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,930
like that rule and actually I actually

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,270
do spelling out of every little every

00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:10,020
number to ten I do tend that's my cutoff

00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:11,940
so I didn't really it didn't bother me

00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,190
so if I'm not bothering me enough to

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,750
even talk about it there's so much else

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,790
in this content that bothered me that I

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:27,720
couldn't even see this you know I had to

00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:31,230
hire our pyrite I put in there okay EGR

00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,260
completely different okay so eg this is

00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:37,710
how I remember the tune these is the

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:43,490
first letter of for example example so

00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:47,820
eg means for example I started I is

00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:50,940
means in other words so you have for

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,680
example in other words completely

00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,370
different but that's how I have to you

00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,540
know

00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,370
these droids remember all this stuff

00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,570
doesn't that make sense to everybody

00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:06,360
okay yeah that's how that's how I do it

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:21,780
who else has a question that you can

00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:24,120
share comments called common common

00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,310
sense but the problem with the book is

00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,310
that it cannot be condensed and just a

00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:30,349
short answer

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,349
[Music]

00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:42,510
okay well great this has been a deep

00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,870
dive and I'm gonna try to okay here's

00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,300
the deal

00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,520
a lot of times commas introduced was

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,160
called parenthetical information which

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,500
is information that's interesting but

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,030
not necessary to the sentence and the

00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,070
parenthetical information can be

00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:07,650
introduced but say let's take the case

00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:10,860
of Susan if she has a husband she did

00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:15,000
have a husband I took that out this is

00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:21,080
true these sentences down okay Susan's

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,080
have been totally first actor who was up

00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,360
[Music]

00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,800
different sentences if you want to try

00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:56,650
you're giving them so let me see if I

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:58,810
can I'm an enthusiast surely lives in

00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,660
Baltimore Baltimore Maryland

00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:04,140
so this is the sentence about a comma

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:08,590
after Meredith surely lives in Baltimore

00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,690
Maryland her husband and two dogs now

00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:14,140
originally this sentence said her

00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,490
husband Kyle and she dogs so what you'd

00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,290
imagine this I know it's hard it's

00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,830
really hard but let's focus on her

00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:23,410
husband for keidel and she knows she has

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,750
no husband his name is Kyle she had a

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:30,060
husband we don't really care about his

00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:35,490
name so imagine that Kyle has to be in

00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:35,490
comics because you hope you can take out

00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:47,170
you have a sentence and you have

00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:49,590
extraneous information you gotta pull it

00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,590
all out

00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,320
have extraneous information little

00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:01,190
sentence community to have it enclosed

00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:03,530
in commas that can be removed and still

00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:07,010
have a little sentence so I took Kyle

00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:09,619
out of this sentence and I still have a

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,660
look at the sentence because his name is

00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,970
Kyle now it doesn't really work the

00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:18,970
other way because if he said she has she

00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:21,800
lives with tile her husband and do dogs

00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:25,400
so her husband actually spared that more

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,080
information so I was kind but you really

00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:33,290
can't make it so that she lives with

00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:35,150
Kyle and you dog why is he in the

00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:37,190
sentence at all so sometimes you have

00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,930
these a judgment about the fact that

00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,670
Kyle is actually the extremes

00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,160
information that connect up a sentence

00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:49,640
and nobody cares so sorry that that mijo

00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:51,650
I told you comments she was right well

00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,150
that's a question I love the stuff one

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,150
minute go woman okay yes

00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:10,920
three times you use a semicolon

00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:13,229
first of all city colons are equal to a

00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,059
comma and a conjunction so you pull the

00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:17,460
common conjunction out of the sentence

00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:21,059
stick a semicolon in there and impact it

00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,890
out to complete sentences I even started

00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,599
a semicolon so think of a teeter totter

00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:27,119
they still have Teeter totters the

00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,470
teeter totter is completely next the

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,499
second time you need to see if it's any

00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:34,259
pop isn't a list when one thing has a

00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:37,470
comma in it okay so I'm going to my

00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:41,249
favorite books are gone through it alas

00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:43,319
Babylon and the bronze but how many

00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:47,609
books did I just tell you are my

00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:50,160
favorite books is it three is it forward

00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:52,410
because there's one book title in that

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,890
this you don't know it it could be two

00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,099
books

00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:58,710
alas comma fabric could be a book called

00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:01,499
lesson cook look called Babylon you have

00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,599
read it's really big story but gone

00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:07,229
through the windows in one book alas

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,390
Babylon is one book the bronze bow is

00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:11,309
one book but my readers don't know this

00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:14,789
so to separate those

00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:16,619
I need a semicolon so then I'm

00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:19,859
communicating with my readers this is

00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:21,869
the starch this is this stop by the way

00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:24,359
with being a serial commas for the

00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:26,880
spirit reason there's no reason why your

00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,700
reader should have taped one second and

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,640
you know when they start and when they

00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,530
stop especially when the sentence goes

00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,080
second why that can be very confusing

00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:38,840
for the poor reader make it simple make

00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:42,650
it simple so now he's talking about

00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,700
semicolons third thing out something

00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,220
compassion

00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:50,360
third thing with like ten seconds to go

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:53,060
there's the third thing okay

00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,840
does one have to say okay take a bit

00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,160
under this pressure

00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,750
I'm sorry sorry didn't these teacher

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,400
didn't tease tease you they'll think

00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,110
about as soon as I walk out the door so

00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,490
we need to be have questioned your not

00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,490
