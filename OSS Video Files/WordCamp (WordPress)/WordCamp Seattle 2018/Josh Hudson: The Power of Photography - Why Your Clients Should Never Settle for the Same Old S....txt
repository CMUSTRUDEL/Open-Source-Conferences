Publication date: 2020-04-12
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Have you heard the phrase, “crappy photography = crappy website?” The photography you use has an incredible power to make or break a project, doesn’t it? Even the most beautiful website build can be crushed by poor quality images taken on a phone. And there is also a dirty little secret that most web designers don’t know about when it comes to using stock images.
Bruce and Josh Hudson, a father and son team, have combined 47 years of experience in the professional photography world, as well as media creating and business. During their program, The Power of Photography, they’ll be sharing:
How photography plays a key role in website development.
Pulling the curtain back and revealing the dirty little secret about stock images and why you should never use them.
Learn what criteria you should be using when looking to partner with a photographer.
The power photography has to create stories and how you can use that in your designs.
And the 7 elements needed to produce images that have intent and impact.
The Hudson’s have a passion for helping their commercial clients tell the story of their business through photography and video. Their ultimate goal with every project is to work directly with developers and designers to achieve a more effective, relatable, and memorable online experience. They are ready to share their secrets and help you learn how to better utilize photography for your clients and websites! Join the Hudson this year in Seattle at Word Camp!

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,690
really our essence commercial brand

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:10,820
which partners with web designers and

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,380
creating really cool designs for a based

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,320
on the photography that we create so

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,720
it's kind of marrying them to and I've

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,950
lived in both of these spaces being an

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,479
agency honor and I used to build

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,180
WordPress websites that currently don't

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,669
I got tired of all the phone calls two

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,930
years later I broke it and fix it so now

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,910
I outsource a lot of the web design

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,740
stuff but I love them that trench with

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,860
you guys for a long time so I kind of

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,700
understand both the web developer side

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,110
of things but also photographer as well

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,880
so what we're going to cover today is

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,860
why photography places you

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
ok ok I'm going to show you some

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,240
examples of some recent stuff to be done

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,730
there little secret about stock images

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,230
and why you should never use them it's

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,850
also a good sell the benefit from your

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,860
clients as well to give them the higher

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,480
photographer or for you to take that on

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,230
yourself maybe white language we'll talk

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,260
about that

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,250
well criteria you should be using when

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,220
looking to partner with a photographer

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,810
three ways to partner without me great

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,330
stories and how you can do something

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,790
that rhymes okay I know that when I was

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,470
doing websites it would just kill me I'm

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,420
create this awesome

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,300
just looking just let the piece of

00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,490
artwork write all the hours of time and

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,990
I bugaloo content but for content and

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,790
then they'd send me you know seven or

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,490
eight cell phone shots from Sally the

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,290
county they look like crap and now I've

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,780
got this beautiful website and crappy

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,210
images okay the dog health story

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,880
don't tell story about this brand or

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,260
this company at all and then you put it

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,950
in there they go I don't like the

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,780
pictures yeah don't get me right so

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,130
we're going to talk about that and then

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,780
we're gonna wrap it all up with seven

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,900
elements that you need to produce images

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,930
that have intent and impact on your

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:58,310
websites so that let's get started we

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,720
got the what they talk tonight oh I'll

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,460
have you guys out of here plenty of time

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,570
to go party oh and I'll see you there by

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,130
the way all right

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,830
so by photography plays a key role in

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,820
website development it's all about

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,460
images with intent

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:17,390
okay now there's two ways that we can do

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,760
this one we have a wordpress designer

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,500
who contacts us and got a client

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,510
here's a website to vote for them can

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,000
you please create images that are

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,550
dynamic they look good they can fit into

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,230
these specific areas of the website so

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,790
then we'll go out to you like this is

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,039
x-gen we've got a location in West

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,150
Seattle and they wanted Kirkland so

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,700
we're not going to photo shoot for them

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,820
and knowing what we know from the

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,110
wordpress designer we're out there and

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,570
we're creating different images and

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,570
looks they're gonna fit on that site so

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,199
this is Julian

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,930
Jesus seek out I mean a great model

00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,389
friend shoot but this was kind of what

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,459
the look they were going for okay

00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,209
Xtreme the type of working out that they

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:04,579
do that I climbed there anything both

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,279
the nothing just kind on invasive and

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:08,750
kind of CrossFit type stuff so we wanted

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,009
to kind of convey that a little bit in

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,750
the imagery so this is the one they

00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:15,680
selected for the homepage but you can

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,759
see here by leaving half that space is

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,649
new there's going to be a graphic

00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,810
they're put there by the web designer so

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,759
it's it's not just one kind of photo

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,259
shoot there's some tenant purpose for it

00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,660
okay so you've got to be able to

00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,009
communicate back to the photographer

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,899
that you're working left or even your

00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:35,449
client okay another way to do this is to

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,569
have the photographs done first then

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,370
design the web site around it okay this

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,410
is a company called outside the box

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,810
manufacturing they do microchips all

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,480
sorts of cool stuff actually in the high

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,860
school would be owner and you kind of

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,389
rekindle I haven't seen they're probably

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,370
in 20 years and she call up Kent Kent

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,899
Chamber thing and get mean images from

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,480
your website and our web designer told

00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,889
us have you to just take it first so

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,990
that was kind of cool doesn't usually

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,310
happen that way but this is kind of what

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,470
we suggest for our clients have the

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,660
photography team first and then they can

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,870
design around it you can see here that

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,819
the web designer we reversed the image

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,709
we cropped in for him and created a

00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:20,540
really cool kind of synopsis of what

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:23,209
they do on the homepage there okay it's

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,519
also good for brain continuity you know

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,649
here's a recent headshot we did for

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,819
Seattle reproductive medicine now we

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,310
head up there about once a month to

00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:33,380
photograph all of the new doctors nurses

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,839
staff anything new staffing that they

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,250
have because they're really big about

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,569
putting that kind of personal face on

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,920
their website of who's going to be

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:43,130
working with you when you show up for

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,959
your treatments and by partnering them

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,879
photographer and us working the let

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,189
people you know labor to go out and

00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,850
create a little look every time right

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:55,220
with the same lighting same pose same

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,650
size so that continuity on that page

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,870
really nice and crisp it doesn't just

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,880
kill you when you're funnier whether

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,170
you're a client sends you you know oh we

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,940
have a builder style you've had shop

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,200
incentive tune it's like a selfie and

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,700
all the other ones look nice and here's

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,140
the one it just stands out as horrible

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,070
right makes the whole website looks

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,170
unprofessional

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,770
so brand community is a big big thing

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,890
that we do as well and then there's

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,590
bringing it all together let's bring

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,210
your cancer in your Cancer Center it's a

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,850
pull ups down the street from our studio

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,560
so they kind of were tasked with

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,910
creating a new website and so we're

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,890
working with the web designers back in

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,480
Atlanta and saying okay what kind of

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,610
looking feeling you guys go for and they

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,170
sent us some examples I said okay do you

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,420
have kind of the website pieced together

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,490
and they did and so based on what they

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,110
sent us we were able to create images

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,930
for specific pages and they're going to

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,210
need so we went out did the full date

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,180
shoot for them you know and then it's

00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,310
bringing it all together creating an

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,080
image for our clients that they have

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,390
ended up printing for tea and portrait

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,630
of and putting in the lobby but then

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,400
also be able to extract by cropping the

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,580
exact measurements needed from the web

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,140
designer then also placing some these

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,300
other kind of more establishing shots

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,930
editorial tech stuff okay show them

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,550
doing their thing you can see the Blues

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,580
harmonizing and just a very crisp clean

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,710
web design and a lot of time doing the

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:23,210
photography that it's working directly

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,800
with that designer now a lot of times

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,470
people say well can we just use stock

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,960
images it's just like stock images and

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,610
then you spend two hours counting hours

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,350
looking through your stock websites

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,550
trying to find that perfect shot right

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,900
okay

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,970
time is money and if you're not going

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,640
for time you're going for projects you

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:44,990
lose money so one thing you can suggest

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,770
is why do you want to be one of the many

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,550
when you can stand out I love when I'm

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,770
out bidding a job for a client

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,510
I love going to like their current

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,490
website and pulling up and images right

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,720
on that homepage and running Google

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,930
Image Search and showing them that

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,390
wealth dr. Peterson that really cool

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,820
image that you like is shared by 25,000

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,500
other doctors websites in the US and oh

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,310
by the way for your competitors down the

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,370
street using the same image doctors

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,280
surgeons dentists lawyers a little

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,620
competitive it's a great way to for us

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,820
as photographers say this is why we want

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,650
to create something original so you

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,180
really stand out okay because the

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,860
consumers out there looking at a lot of

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,740
different websites they start seeing

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,820
that same image wait a minute okay

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,080
people are smarter than that plus you

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,640
get a lot better SEO if you have

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,140
original images on your site there's a

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,990
bunch of stock there on a whole bunch of

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,180
others okay so what you can do is you

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,180
can work with a photographer to create

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,800
that stock image look for a website that

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,250
you're building but make it an original

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,250
image

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,060
it's telling you family medicine on the

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,590
right there that's exactly what we did

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,560
there web designer said hey we need some

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,210
kind of more spot looking engaging you

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,130
know we're a family doctor family

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,780
practice that's actually one of the

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,910
doctors that essentially is dollar she

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,740
came in to do that to become the model

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,330
for the shoot you can see her we can

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,340
create something that looks stocked that

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:18,610
makes it original okay once again

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,380
another stock image here's the original

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,630
match that we created for this is a

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,040
greater cancer center again and actually

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,560
coincidentally the gentleman posing

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,030
there and back his head closing it was

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,190
actually Klein worse he was actually

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,480
getting treatments done there we kind of

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,160
found out about that so that was a great

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,150
way to sort of integrate him he's

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,130
already climbed barge

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,760
trusted us and he was one of the willing

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,340
to do it and if you guys are in the

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,450
bottle you just talk to me

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,710
super cheap I am I am the face of a lot

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,500
of different websites around the normal

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,730
question accidents Bellevue Camel

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,640
medicine on the left and that's uh

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,250
savannas working on orthodontia or other

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,230
dogs on the right so sometimes if you

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,330
need a model you just jump right in and

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,500
get it done but one thing I would

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,910
suggest is when you're working with your

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,120
clients that they are gonna be doing the

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,060
photo shoot that's going integrate

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,430
patients or customers clients leave that

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,800
definitely to the to the business to

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,470
coordinate that but say you know we're

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,210
getting three or four people there

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,740
sometimes it's you show up at well we

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,100
don't have a bottle okay I guess I'll do

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,560
it

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:31,120
but uh anyway you needn't bother alright

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,700
so here's a little bit of criteria the

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,130
Department of the photographer we are

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,870
not all created equal I'm not going to

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,210
say the paragraph that my dad hired the

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,530
best ever although he is one of only a

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,850
handful of Master Craftsmen

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,680
photographers the entire state of

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,810
Washington we've been in business thirty

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,920
six years but there's a lot of great

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,780
photographers that are just going to

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,010
start and have great eyes as well but

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,480
just realize that not all of us are

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,790
created equal especially when shooting

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,540
with intent for commercial purposes like

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,190
this okay things you need to focus on

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,740
would be experience

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,230
okay experience in this realm the realm

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,740
of creative things specifically for web

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,940
designs for marketing campaigns there

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,740
are great wedding photographers out

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,780
there great family photographer straight

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,530
baby photographers it's not the same

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:19,360
thing okay you want to see completed

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,990
projects not just a portfolio with their

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,120
best

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,320
this goes for wedding photographers if

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,300
any of you were thinking to get married

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,460
when you sit down to the consultation

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,170
they show you the best of the best say I

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,290
want to see an actual album of an entire

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,210
wedding start to finish okay so and

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,360
that's a great way to avoid a

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,160
photographer going out and shooting 500

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,500
images and you

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,120
three that you can use can be very

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,680
frustrating so make sure you see

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,129
completed project through something not

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,170
just the portfolio of their best

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,459
equipment you know what kind of lenses

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,440
what kind of lighting

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:55,889
I'm not a big equipment on you know

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,470
Nikon Canon Sony it it's all cameras

00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:01,050
just the tools my dad would say but make

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,370
sure that the look can going for can be

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,620
achieved by the equipment of that

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,659
photographer possesses okay different

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,970
focal lengths the lenses the type of

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:11,549
lighting had a guy to show over the

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,500
studio randomly on Thursday who wanted

00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,120
somebody new product photography is

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,610
really fancy headlights thinking of

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,459
course from Japan his web designer said

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,159
go to photographer have some product

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,480
shots done on the transparent background

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:26,100
you know I don't want any glare on the

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,860
lens which is kind of tricky to do and

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,960
so he's been trying to go and let them

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,260
spend hours weeks I do have a pipeline

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,970
with mappable studio kit thing and best

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,010
body right when you put your brain in

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,860
there and you can photograph it came by

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,679
the studio and you just like I can't do

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,720
anything so you guys Matthew in this

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,909
team two weeks ago so spending all that

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,210
time and money kind of yourself you know

00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:53,250
yeah right so you know we have equipment

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,570
we can create that okay but not all

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,960
photographers do is to make sure you

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,610
check that out price you're going to get

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,380
what you pay for

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,720
there are commercial guides that charge

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,580
ten thousand obsession there are also

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,419
people that charge 50 bucks I do believe

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,730
you what you pay for

00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:14,429
so if you come applying for a price

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,049
conscious you know baby remind that this

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:18,090
is an investment you know it's an

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,679
investment not only the website but

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,260
being able to use those images as

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,289
content for future marketing campaigns a

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:29,640
lot of other different things okay I

00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:31,110
would look for someone full-time if you

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,880
have somebody that doesn't kind of as a

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,159
side hustle you know they may be great

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,530
you might be waiting four five six weeks

00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,480
in earnest okay they get visiting with

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,850
Boeing they get busy with Microsoft or

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,010
we work for Facebook and Google

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,630
I would personally I'd prefer somebody

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,770
full-time that way I know I'm gonna get

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,450
what I'm paying for

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,940
we need at the time a lot of them get it

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,970
done as fast as possible

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,340
um photoshop skills once again times

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,560
money if a photographer stand watching

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,210
the 500 images in 270 yet

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,700
now you've gotta process them you've got

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,080
to go through a problem I wouldn't

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,430
recommend hiring something like that I'd

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,590
hire somebody who's going to give you a

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,870
finished image for the specs that you

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,790
guys want okay

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,080
and believe it or not there are a lot of

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,290
photographers out there that are not

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,840
very Photoshop centric my father is one

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,000
of them that's why we hired adopting Amy

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,530
who is our bonus top designer she does

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,720
everything Photoshop elated at the

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,300
studio and we're able to turn images

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,730
from a morning photoshoot to finish

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,740
afternoon to the wordpress design

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,540
they're ready to go and our clients

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,190
really appreciate that and 11 lovers

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,080
appreciate that to get it done quickly

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,530
and that's because we've got a full-time

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,130
gal that does it for us professional

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,570
associations a lot of people don't know

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,210
that there are actually some pretty big

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,860
associations or partners PBA

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,850
professional photographers of America

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,640
that kind of interests that might buy

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,620
you a little bit there's a big 50 or

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,120
60,000 photographers that are a part of

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,060
this group this is kind of our governing

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,150
body for our industry so I would look

00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,210
and I would ask are you remember BPA you

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,850
know not all legitimate photographers

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,410
have to be member of it but I would say

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,850
it's a pretty good benchmark if you're a

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,430
member of PPA you're paying the dues

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,340
you've got insurance you're probably

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,540
going to be able to have photographer we

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,920
hear more locally professional

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,100
photographers of Washington's have an

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,360
option of BPA you can go to ppwe or you

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,010
can actually search for photographer

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,720
right there and you've got to go

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,090
thumbtack or any of that crap you go

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,490
there find once legit that lives by you

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,930
call mom's - hey about a project like

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,960
this

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,730
your work may need to be hard day one

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,320
thing last day of weight is that

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,940
no-cell-phone zone you're going to have

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,260
people show up and need with your

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,970
clients if you're the one giving the

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,790
recommendation and they show up at the

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,650
cellphone it's a no-no so make sure when

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,630
you're finding a photographer in

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,340
development you want to make sure the

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,870
equipment's correct because if they show

00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,890
up with a cell phone your clan should go

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,560
what the heck is this guy two guys

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,930
snapping okay and it happens more than

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,340
you think nowadays everybody concern

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,370
photographer little portrait mode on the

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,860
iPhone okay all right

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,460
three ways to partner this is how you

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,950
can get involved with people like me

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,320
either the client can hire me and I

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,490
actually recommend against this I think

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,370
that anytime you're doing the web

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:25,070
project the more control you can have

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,240
over the content the better because we

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,820
know when we leave that in the hands of

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,490
our clients we usually get crap so I

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,250
like being in control but if your client

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,130
wants to hire and they can I would go

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,990
more up the white label type scenario

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,580
okay weird either you're going out and

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,220
hiring inter tog refer or you're

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,650
building it into your bids and your jobs

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,240
and find someone that you'd like to work

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,590
with and make that sellable benefit to

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,300
your clients that they not only my name

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,980
into web design or in a professional

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,710
photography that's going to enhance it

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,910
as well okay and when you find a

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,760
photographer negotiator

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,000
I mean I've negotiated these down pretty

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,920
darn cheap based on volume you know a

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,890
few web designers that send us you know

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,290
five or six gigs a month you know how

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,150
could you break that price you know you

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,620
just keep those plants coming because

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,210
it's also a great way for me to meet new

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,980
businesses new companies they're going

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,210
to need things besides just website

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,860
photography in the future so it's a

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:25,500
win-win okay

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:29,070
or yep exactly that's right or learn how

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,830
to do it okay ngo learner there's a

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,429
place that teaches photography we've had

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:37,620
a ton of creatives come to our boxes out

00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:39,270
of the studio and so much so that we're

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,210
actually developing in class that's for

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,850
web designers better website photography

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,170
so Carla who's not here now but she's

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,320
running around that's actually how I met

00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,790
Carla it came to one of our logo classes

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,480
she stayed out her and said hey I'd like

00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:57,120
to learn more and my dad goes okay cool

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,880
beyond 115 hours from two hours for

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,740
private lesson she goes well I've got a

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,840
whole bag of skill sets and actually we

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,179
use hers all of our video editing now in

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,190
graphics and stuff sort of a name kind

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,990
of trade but now we actually work with

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,460
Carla more professional level she's the

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,530
executive producer of our radio show

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,049
we've done some website projects

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,460
together and she's currently building a

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,410
new website for us let's go to our

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,850
clocks course right now so we've

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,640
actually become one of her clients which

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,929
is kind of cool so there's ways that you

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,580
learn how to do this yourself and

00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:27,720
they'll be pretty cool if you could just

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,220
go out there and do the website

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,049
photography and then build in and you

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:36,600
get exactly what you want so that's what

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:41,400
I recommend as well I think an image is

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:44,630
a way to tell story guys and gals of

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,830
that brand of that nonprofit of that

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,210
mom-and-pop shop business and Capitol

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,710
Hill that you're building the website or

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,929
okay the images can be used to enhance

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,620
that brand but also tell story behind

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:57,210
this you know century security we

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,280
actually went out into the whole night

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,320
shoot with one of their security guards

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,360
while he was on duty which was kind of

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,210
fun actually wasn't wasn't white center

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,690
very exciting people trying to break

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,140
into the look London's up there but you

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,400
know basically spending and you

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,730
with one of these guys and sort of

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,350
capturing who he you know who he is and

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,970
what is what he's doing and then you

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,710
know images that convey the brand of

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,720
we're here to help over here to protect

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:27,990
that kind of stuff

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:31,840
Wartortle right industries which run

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:35,070
very good it's it's a not-for-profit

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:39,520
company that she builds parts for Boeing

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,419
they do some factory assembly for

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,919
companies like Comcast and they hire

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,540
people that are disabled have learning

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,520
disabilities have visible disabilities

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,750
or people that are getting out of prison

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,110
that are looking to kind of put your

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,730
life back together my brother-in-law is

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,620
a counselor for them for a long time you

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,169
gotta stuff that with them and we spent

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:02,679
three days documenting two locations

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:05,559
layers of all of their employees telling

00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,090
the stories of each one of them for

00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,160
their quarterly report also further new

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,210
website they were building but I mean

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,090
it's that image to just tell a little

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,280
story there this guy is so happy he's

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,380
got a job who's making money you've got

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,850
a purpose and Orion that's what they

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,760
give is they give people a purpose and

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,440
life again so it's very cool to spend

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,429
time with that but you'd be able to tell

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,270
us with your images is very powerful

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:29,950
you know how about the history of a

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,980
business or a training you know once

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:35,080
again here's Orion the gentleman on the

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,880
right is the trainer gentleman on the

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,370
left actually just got out of prison

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,440
once again slightly back together so he

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,090
was betting he was hired and he is just

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,460
so happy to have a second chance in life

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,470
again and just showing the mentorship

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,490
and he working with in and telling that

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:55,000
story or Jerusem forth which is just

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,740
down here kind of by um Museum of YT ok

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,470
many people don't know that a lot of the

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,280
big components on ships and submarines

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,700
and airplanes

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,740
still has to be hand forged there's no

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,910
computer program model anything they can

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,429
do that it's all going to be done by

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,410
hand so we've done ourselves up start

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,210
the shoot at 4:00 a.m. that's when

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,300
they'll open the kilns they take out

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,480
these huge house

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,160
steel and they've got go and I mean it's

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,400
like thirty thousand degrees it's crazy

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,570
and we documented all warning this kind

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,730
of forgot that rated the most people

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,680
thought that was still around and the

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,270
guys behind yeah so just kind of an

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,690
iconic women's here those guys the whole

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,190
thing out we've got some lethal shots of

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:38,870
the hand which account of the metal and

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:41,960
everything those personalized don't

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,190
personalized you know so many times your

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,580
clients who I don't want to put my

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:49,520
picture on the website team

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:51,470
personalization is key I think to an

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,260
effective website effective web presence

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,490
I really do so being able to get a

00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,020
client where we're gonna go this is

00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,940
actually outside the box manufacturing

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,110
that's Allison right there you're

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,570
starting the company with their husband

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,610
out of their garage ten years ago now

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,010
they've got this huge facility tons of

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,380
employees and we did a whole photo shoot

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,120
there and then we handed it up on a live

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,860
doing kind of shot of the whole company

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,350
and this is kind of an iconic shot on

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,290
their website of this is who we are this

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,700
is the team we built and the story

00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:24,110
behind them starting their garage and

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,680
now being where they are ok very cool or

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:29,690
a lawyer so instead of just doing a you

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,340
know a stuffy head shot at the studio

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,230
we're gonna go out to where he does this

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,240
thing which is can't read from Justice

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,190
Center he's actually DUI attorneys name

00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,660
- DUI Joe who's hilarious by the way

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,820
he's retired

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,290
otherwise I'd say lead won't you don't

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,090
never what have a higher DUI attorney

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,100
but if you ever did he would be the guy

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,650
you want to call we wanted something

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,180
that was still professional for training

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,130
him as kind of the man in charge in

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,110
control but also personable

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,970
he's got the jacket off its kind of hold

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,980
on to it kind of semi-casual right

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,200
that's the branding to you my Joe goes

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,720
for what

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,629
it's still something well we have

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,200
something smiling he's like now because

00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:13,600
I was like a pushover so that's kind of

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,830
how we took the jacket off and then once

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,869
again working with his web designer

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,389
there's a spot on the website for kind

00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,919
of tall skinny vertical so that's kind

00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:22,720
of look we went for you've got the

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,080
pillars back there parallel lines right

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:31,289
okay okay

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,639
coming to the end here okay great I

00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,460
wanted to see about 45 minutes so we're

00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:37,960
right on time so if you're seven

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,220
elements aim to produce images with

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,029
impact and intent for your designs okay

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,960
things to look for we're going to go

00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:49,779
three twenties individually exposure

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,299
proper exposure make some different

00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,840
samples of that images that are probably

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,999
exposed to have a pop to them not a

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,489
darkness order and overexposed image

00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:01,989
which you'll see in the section here

00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:04,840
composition leading line to the rule of

00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:07,899
thirds certain impact points on an image

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,690
right none of the girl with the X Jim

00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,999
webpage that's a very strong impactful

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:17,379
image because the rule of thirds and one

00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:20,769
example of that lighting effects will

00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:25,330
say is nice because not late enough

00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:26,830
doing that slide anyway it wouldn't be a

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,539
Hudson presentation if you didn't see

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,429
least one typo so we used to have a

00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:33,279
thing about you know if you can spot the

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:35,309
typo buddy beer after class but I

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,910
spotted this like I said - all the gears

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:41,080
of weight dead 5 so I'll show you

00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:44,100
lighting can be key especially it looks

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,620
like a headshot or portrait

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:52,470
let's perspective look for depth and

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:56,110
dimension okay you want to take a 2d

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,300
media and make it look 3d okay there's

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,100
different ways you can do that bodily

00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,540
once again telling you a story okay

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,140
furthering that brand that you're

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,550
working with and then color you know if

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,130
you want things too hard on us or if you

00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,290
want things to be have attention drawn

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,980
to that okay we can do that with color

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,360
as well

00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:21,790
and then lastly texture so careless

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:26,140
exposure so here's an image for a

00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:27,850
restaurant and with the lighting here if

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,620
it was if we have a light stand you get

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,050
them there's a lot better but it's very

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,230
dark okay and very dark not proper

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,880
properly exposed a lot of times when

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,559
restaurants you just out for us to work

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,940
with them they'll show us images that

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,110
were created by the photographer and I

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,570
can tell right away if they weren't

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,210
using a insert lighting trying to do

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,790
more of a natural Andean type thing be

00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,070
aware if it was exposed properly okay so

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,780
you get kind of a dark look on it and

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,900
you try to fix in Photoshop is looking

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:59,530
contrasting all that great or one that's

00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,190
over it's ghost okay somebody doesn't

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,260
know what they're doing with the

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,960
lighting doesn't kind of expose properly

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,809
an image then should properly expose is

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,280
going to have that pop to it okay you

00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:10,780
can see here kind of the finished

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,610
product of what that restaurant

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,850
I'm ended up putting on the homepage of

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,179
their site they're cheap you know to die

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,450
for

00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:22,380
actually anyone from the south end Kent

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:25,990
area Trenton you ever go to follows

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,900
follows in Kent yeah that was there

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,040
Trevino so there's ten grand rooms and

00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,970
hey chef Paul I saw you in the

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,980
presentation good buddy of ours so

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,080
composition leading light to create

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,410
depth and dimension and you take an

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,080
image that's a 2d medium right and with

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,390
leading lines you can create that

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,910
dimension to it you can see here kind of

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:54,810
a focal point to my dad

00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:55,770
or okay you're nice drawn to it so

00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,600
there's a lot of different ways in

00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,260
composition you can do that the rule of

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,920
thirds you know think of the impact

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,240
planks on that dimension okay so when

00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,180
you're working with photographers with

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,070
your designs if they don't already know

00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,090
this explain this to them saying this is

00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,160
kind of what we're looking for we need

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,410
images that are high impact but also

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,410
have intent to this design mentally okay

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,990
like proper lighting is key and check

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,210
out the eyes so here is Brianna one of

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,240
our old employees of the studio wobbling

00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:33,990
for us you know pretty girl pretty image

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,040
this was the enemy light here's the

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,500
kissa flash see the difference that if

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,440
you come up close and you look at her

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,480
eyes you'll see a little a little

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
sparkle a little twinkle in there that's

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,830
actually the flash in her eyes okay

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,160
Rembrandt used to paint with all these

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,510
paint back they didn't have flash so he

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,910
always paint with a little bit of white

00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,650
in the end somebody's eyes to give that

00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,700
I to pop a little bit so it's not dead

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,490
okay

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,290
been doing it for hundreds of years and

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,880
if you get a photographer this is way

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,100
more than ambient light situations yeah

00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,570
there might be other get something okay

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,610
but it's not gonna pop like something

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,670
that's properly lit okay it's where the

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:17,130
equipment comes into play and that's

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,990
perspective you know you've got

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:22,370
sometimes for a full length like a

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:26,970
twelve millimeter that exact same pose

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:29,070
with a 200 millimeter you know when the

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,270
perspective can change look or feel of

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,270
an image big time

00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,860
you know depth of field this is kind of

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,480
i phone portrait mode thing you can

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,829
actually deal with a real camera too

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,009
with depending on the

00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:48,049
you know here I mean your Cancer Center

00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:50,179
again you know they're looking over case

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:54,679
that's what the doctor they're trying to

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:57,229
convey but they tear the professional

00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,459
and this image had major intent because

00:33:57,229 --> 00:34:02,559
they had a graphic that was going right

00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:06,189
here okay once again doing photography

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,230
zooming in really close to the long lens

00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:12,230
get that good sharp crisp feel to it

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:17,629
okay with a lot of depth of field behind

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:21,589
it and the mileage here's an image that

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:23,990
we created for a resort in Jamaica we

00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:26,269
actually photographed this couple down

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,289
there and the resort contacted us and

00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:29,839
said hey did you guys have anything

00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:31,789

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,539
course gave us permission but you know

00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:34,369
tell us a story

00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:37,159
you know sunset they just got married

00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:40,909
there on beach he's just intervenes it

00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,799

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,259
know or dr. Cashman orthodontist in

00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:47,179
Covington you know he's very personable

00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:50,059
the guy is hilarious exciting Jerry

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,829
Seinfeld hilarious and you go into the

00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,440
consultation with them and we just sat

00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:56,299
the consultation and just and let them

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,680
do this thing and we have the lighting

00:34:56,299 --> 00:35:00,980
setup and other things that just do your

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,200
thing dr. Cashner okay but it's a basic

00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,480
story you know over here you've got mom

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,029
smiling you've got him smiling we've got

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,710
the x-ray in the back we've got all his

00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:11,690
awards and everything you want conveyed

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:14,299
about this man is in that image it tells

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:19,849
that story okay once again it's an image

00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:22,579
with intent and then color harmony can

00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:26,359
create a calm feel okay so if you've got

00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:29,299
an acquaintance big nose up its paw or

00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,839
maybe it's Dennis and the want to go for

00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:34,339
that kind of calm feeling and that well

00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,270
the type of color harmony that you have

00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:39,680
internet is

00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,450
can do a lot for that here's motion we

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,540
did for some wrong company I can't

00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:47,810
remember you know my dad's there there's

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,180
a bunch of the cool orange our dorms and

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:54,070
their label concept the bottom of their

00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,070
create kind of harmonious look to it

00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,360
some other stuff he was doing we nearly

00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:02,330
last year okay but color harmony for it

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,120
call me wherever the color contrasts

00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,230
you're going to draw a lot of attention

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,300
so depending on the business you're

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,160
working with and their brand and what

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,190
they're going for maybe this is the

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,950
direction won't go okay something that

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:20,380
really just stands out amongst

00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:23,690
everything else and then there's texture

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:27,500
it wouldn't be a wedding dress this is

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:31,550
for a wedding the wedding designer dress

00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,320
designer but kind of going to that that

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:38,260
soft kind of silky kind of smooth

00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:40,280
texture right or resort up into Fino

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,780
kind of want to show off some of the

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,940
different textures and the different

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,480
rocks and that because photography up

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,880
there you know or a little restoration

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,340
company that wants to kind of show some

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:58,360
before and after type stuff right really

00:36:52,340 --> 00:37:00,050
rough hard texture so box enclosing

00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,570
photography should be part of your

00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,660
design it shouldn't be an afterthought

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,370
should be climb will send me some stuff

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,370
it should be part of your designs okay

00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:14,270
from the very beginning we're correctly

00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:16,340
with photographer you know and I would

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,890
build it into your bids maybe yours make

00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:22,520
yourself kind of a one-stop shop okay

00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,230
I've had a lot of success with a lot of

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,930
web designers where we're kind of like

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:29,120
white labeled behind the scenes we go

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,400
into the shoot clients are super happy

00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,410
he gets more referrals and turn to get

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,910
more business okay so I think if you

00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,500
work directly with a photographer it's

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,540
going to help out quite a bit on both

00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,090
ends

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,160
like I said white label or learn to do

00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,420
it yourself and keep that control right

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,280
because we know when we multiply

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,780
go rogue and get their own content stuff

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,340
never usually turns out all that great

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,800
remember that the images on your designs

00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,000
should have impact an intent okay once

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,890
again it goes back to working with

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,620
photographer either showing them we've

00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,570
already done or building it based on

00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,600
what they send you as far as a finished

00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,010
image well that's that

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,630
thanks everyone if you have questions

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,630
I'll be here if not I'll see you bar

00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,280
