Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Iâ€™d like to share tools to boost productivity both online and offline. (Some tie into WordPress, and those will be highlighted.) Subtopics include: project management, task lists/to-dos, scheduling, booking, virtual meetings, screen sharing, bookkeeping, backup options, and cloud storage. Tools discussed are a mix of free and paid, which provide options for every budget.
