[Music]

all right so regardless of the business

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,970
that you're in you can probably relate

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,460
to a little bit of disorganization and

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:05,350
some of us we can relate to you a whole

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:13,840
lot of discrimination there are so many

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:16,330
ideas together well we've gotta get our

help us and it's going to help our

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,520
clients but there's so much to do in so

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,100
little time right but if I already had

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,140
waved my magic wand over Twitter please

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,060
do and give us all four hours of the day

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,560
so we could get it everything done that

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,260
we intend to obviously I'm not a genie

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,989
but I have little processes that can

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,280
work like magic and create more time in

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:47,380
your day to do more profitable tasks so

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,489
today I'm going to share with you the

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,269
processes that experience or business

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,360
page and here's your bonus parking tip

00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,140
by the way use a dog or a baby or a

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,180
strange actions get people's attention

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:10,000
this dog is my baby this is Kirby

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:14,170
he's an 11 year old older retriever MC

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,060
you remember I am you can help on my

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,200
voice

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,660
each often too healthy remember now in

00:03:19,200 --> 00:04:13,880
formal education communications my

00:03:21,660 --> 00:04:16,950
research focus okay so my professional

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,340
experience includes working in highly

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,350
regulated industries like investment

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,330
broker dealers and insurance agencies

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,970
properties passionately associations

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,330
healthcare education nonprofits and

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,900
construction design mill developers as a

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,220
result I learned how to manage the

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,080
advertising marketing internal

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,220
communications trainings and website

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,780
through the compliance review process

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,630
speaking of highly regulated industries

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,470
did you know that an industry is highly

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:54,440
regulated against security heavy as

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,440
making juices wordpress websites

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,350
any wordpress

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,600
so hopefully if you're a business owner

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,280
being a business owner even if you're

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,170
freelancer you're still a business owner

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,280
hopefully it challenges your confidence

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,740
your self-worth and your skills but well

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,389
it will but not we didn't chops we

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,790
haven't realized in many different ways

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:19,030
that the challenge may be as it should

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,520
and 20 years of mastery when crafting

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,220
keep me from feeling like a kid or an

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,550
idiot when it came to all this business

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:43,960
and it is all this BS and business stuff

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:46,810
that keeps us just about yes right but

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,210
then we would almost froze opportunities

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,580
to not only identify the crush those

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:57,190
challenges so this period 2018 I played

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,620
it as the year of streamlining and

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:12,370
automating my business as much as

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:14,650
possible so I literally start out people

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,330
that embody the tricks that I wanted in

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,810
my organization and because I was

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,750
focusing on my digital environment I

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,789
naturally thought out my computer genius

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,520
John hansman

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:34,330
for his integrity and his first tip was

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,729
make your bed he explained that it

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,190
started with house how you organizes his

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,150
day and how he starts it so after that

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,270
that's one past

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,720
unless of what's to come next Jenna

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,600
became aware that solutions were more

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,000
about how I operate so firm Todd I

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,199
realized that not all the solutions are

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,930
gonna be in my computer so in addition

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,510
to making my best where else could I

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,440
start so I connected with the Miss

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,120
Budweiser Cal Thornton who's a cognitive

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,110
specialist and cognitive reframing I

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,289
shared with her my desired outcomes so

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,979
we identified current efficiencies in my

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:21,500
business operations and then you reverse

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:24,919
engineered my ear ingles into paste and

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:30,350
measurable steps that included both

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:33,889
business and personal practices and now

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,389
he was out for me was so awesome and it

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,490
was so helpful that we just couldn't

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,100
keep it to ourselves so we ended up

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,380
taking the first 90 days and putting it

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,900
into a five-week program and we open it

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,389
up for others to join us and we call it

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,250
the pilot spy program and we had other

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,780
stories and I figured hey if I'm

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:57,169
struggling with it somebody else is too

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:59,150
right II need so an aside not only did I

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:08,460
meet some my goal

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:11,310
early so I wasn't always known for being

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,090
organized and my brother and I won't

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,009
tell you his name share the story but he

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,110
will tell you the story about how he had

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,050
together to my part turn Community

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,750
College and he shoved himself between

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,270
books and papers and dog related items

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,740
and it isn't writing story and funding

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,530
inheritance on it but it isn't funny

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,690
when it's about your business the

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:38,339
biggest challenge for the messy

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,690
disorganized spontaneous creative genius

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,159
it is where do I start

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,770
right how do I even know how to get

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,529
organized and what does process even

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,720
mean to me in my business so when it

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,180
came to identify where started and how

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,820
to classify tasks and projects I found

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,270
way too many possibilities too many

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,640
overlaps and just too much so you can

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,940
see the additional challenges that may

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,810
be disorganized created but ultimately

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,580
all of these main reduced income

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:15,410
stunting growth questionable reliability

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,880
and credibility devalued in work

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,709
depending leaves and little

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,089
self-confidence but you know what does

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:26,100
increase your anxiety and your stress so

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,190
I figured out what my problem is so now

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,440
how do I solve it so more than two

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,870
thousand times like in herds work under

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,830
process or with path what's your process

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,180
but I didn't even know what that meant

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,690
then there was something about systems

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,279
but the computer okay I mean people want

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,410
to deal with the computer yeah because I

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,050
wanted to know if you're on what process

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,809
was so it's one one

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,149
I devoured everything the content I

00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,249
could on the subject from podcast of

00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,009
books to videos and I saw it up and

00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:02,050
connected with creative groups mentors

00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:06,220
and business experts in person online

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:09,220
anyway a good as results I purchased

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,290
what's called a swipe file from a fellow

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,769
designer turned business coach her name

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,509
is Jean quello at sweetly burn design

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,790
Hearst White House included an email

00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:21,009
that out one former clients how she

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,189
works the steps they'll go through

00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:26,559
working with her how to type progress

00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:29,799
and how that we communicate with the

00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,410
project that was my lightbulb moment

00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,350
there was a Templar right there tell her

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,309
process so I studied it is mine like

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,059
hers below

00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:42,040
it's not so how do I do this then I just

00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:44,410
simple simply used her tablet as an

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,829
online for my home process and that

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:51,220
became my very first step and became my

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:55,600
first email template so where do I start

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,089
with my clients or leads email yes that

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,399
will start by the swipe file but now I

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,110
can use that email template as the

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,299
starting point for writing scripts or

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:08,049
myself or phone call another way I get

00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:10,689
my clients that's my initial inquiry

00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:12,999
process now getting the disorganized

00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:15,759
organized is the first step in

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:18,850
streamlining templates and out might

00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,879
help create clarity structuring every

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,100
news redundancy now my work is custom

00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,939
but the path to get there uses templates

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,939
but templates don't mean that it

00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:34,209
impersonal or that it's generic their

00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,009
place to start so I go into my edit when

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,980
you see personalized by adding their

00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:40,839
name their business and probably

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,139
information that I might know about the

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,480
project and making specific comments on

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:49,650
now I recommend that

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,780
spreadsheet and outlining process and I

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,640
actually wish I have done that started

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,890
this way because it's free its

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,800
customizable for your specific needs and

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,320
who cares you to be fully ready for the

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,770
right CMS classroom for you and why did

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,230
I say that I want to CMS long before I

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,570
knew what I needed in it now all you can

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:15,930
process would have been far more

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:19,560
effective and cost saving so just start

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,180
anywhere just get started create

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,150
different sheets in your workbook and

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,120
this is how you're going to start and

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,740
then each sheet can be your service so

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,380
on your first sheet for me would be

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,890
branding so that's my first service so

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,370
my first step in there I could call one

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,350
and then I listened to every time so

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,230
that I see through my first step in my

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,150
process column 2000 step listen link to

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,340
every file or template that I have or

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,980
any going to create for that process and

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,340
so on and so on you can eventually have

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:58,980
an entire client journey streamlined

00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:02,280
with your spreadsheets now I heard from

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,950
loving some business coaches and its

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,480
owners to recommend outsourcing they say

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,840
hey if you don't want to do it outsource

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,060
it I didn't even know my own processes

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,500
said how on earth can I can I even know

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,480
what I needed and if I didn't know what

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,620
I'm even exactly what would I hire

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:23,220
someone else to do for me so also how do

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,750
I know if not sourcing is worth it if I

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,090
don't know how much time it takes me to

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,360
do it how do I would know if there's an

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,820
ROI for doing that right but if I could

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,420
answer that then I'd know a rate at

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,760
which it

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,940
outsource I also know would it be a

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,920
project manager and that's what a lot of

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,110
my peers business earners becoming

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,180
because of outsourcing and eventually

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,339
some of them packed it in and closed

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,500
their businesses so before you consider

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:52,690
outsourcing you need to know your

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,600
process and have as much straight line

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,600
is on and automate as possible that way

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,820
when you are ready to outsource you will

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,070
be far better prepared kind of far

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,779
better use of your time and money and if

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,260
your outsource room can be more

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:10,630
effective and productive now these may

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,089
seem time-consuming and they are but in

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,470
the end they are time-saving so don't

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,360
worry about the time it takes to make it

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,839
perfect you can finesse it as you go

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,230
along good and done is better than

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,270
perfect so with your plan with your

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,180
process outline you can create a

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,279
smoother workflow that will lead to more

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,430
efficiency not just for you but your

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:38,920
clients and that makes time happy happy

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:43,150
clients I tend to tend more girls

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,740
so your efficient work of manually does

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,570
in the more time in Wednesday and

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,520
communication is how we develop these

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,480
client relationships so the question is

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,420
how your clients do want to communicate

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,250
so first identify your clients that's

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,770
how you learn how to communicate with

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,500
them so you need to better understand

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,930
and until they know your clients you can

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,250
download their branded UX worksheet on

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,170
my website it is a valuable resource

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,430
at any stage but especially it's really

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,530
convenient enough for me one clients my

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:23,430
thoughts with something like this some

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:26,940
of my clients are fast paced and not

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,710
only they not like both all emails or

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,750
meetings they don't want any further

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,500
communication once once the project is

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,710
underway

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,110
you know status updates or tasks these

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,310
planets are called Eagles if they see

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,990
the big picture

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,170
and then leave the details for others

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,480
and then quickly move on if you're not

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,180
familiar with the Sandler district

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,760
Sandler training tape on the disc

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,650
personality it's worth the search there

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,990
you'll find four Birds and an eagle and

00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,430
a love dove and apparent and everyone

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,050
falls into that one of those four

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:03,840
categories so that's one clients some

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,150
may not be all that organized but now

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,670
they don't have to be because I am I

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,310
create the process specifically for the

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,840
clients and we may need any homework or

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,090
ones that need to be completed with a

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,220
little or no staff and prepared to

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,620
complete as much of that stuff as

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,880
possible of course that requires a lot

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,560
of time on my part

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,660
guess what that's another opportunity

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,089
because of this evil I realized I could

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,910
read passages for different types of

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,880
clients so I structured services and

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,470
grants to account for the client's needs

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,209
discovered the project their budget at

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,329
my time

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:43,699
acquirements so your workbook that you

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:45,559
have helps you identify or refresh your

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:48,079
client profile so this is also available

00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:51,819
in my oriental us worksheet on my

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,470
website so packages are another way to

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:56,809
streamline it makes it easier for your

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,910
clients to choose how they want to work

00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:02,269
with you based on their time budget and

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,760
project needs now keep in mind some

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:08,149
clients sulfites will prefer at infant

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,059
milestones others will want of things in

00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:14,149
between milestones and yet others tend

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,309
to be way too communicative which will

00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:18,470
require more structure and boundaries on

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,439
your part now these boundaries can be

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,289
outlined again enforce the contract but

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,120
a friendlier way is to include them in

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:29,919
your outline for each step and process

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,779
that you give them by phone email text

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,809
social opinion meeting however you do it

00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:38,750
it's just affirm their way so then you

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,419
just refer to your template you'll

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,159
remind them of what's going next provide

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,440
a little more detail than the initial

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,020
overview of the process that

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,700
expectations and then acknowledge when

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,240
steps have been completed over the

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:56,299
project is complete so now you can see

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,950
the benefit to your business so let's

00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,789
say you created two different client

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,890
profiles

00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,899
you know how to each communicate there's

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,730
your lucky and they book or email that's

00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,620
great you don't have to worry about

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,510
these

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,500
a little bit right but eventually you

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,970
will have quiet to white other

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,820
communication so you'll need to develop

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,140
all those eventually right so you need

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,690
to ask yourself what are those

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,900
milestones conversations one of their

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,120
frequent conversations so if I start

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,490
with five milestones for me at the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,020
beginning then things like this it's the

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,110
initial inquiry which is the first

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,540
conversation they have with me consider

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,780
working together right then there's the

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,280
proposal then there's getting started

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,100
working together which is the client

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,880
onboarding step then we have a review of

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,309
concepts final artwork approval delivery

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,880
of all necessary files and then the

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:55,870
project and for all of those steps I

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,650
need an email template and basic script

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,390
for calls and agenda for meetings

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,000
now meetings are cool by the way because

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,470
they're different for both and because

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,930
you can see their faces right you can

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,990
also have the benefit of

00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:12,660
and you can see their expressions you

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,880
know what's working what's fine you can

00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,050
go up script if you need to just as long

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,310
as you stay focused I get that head step

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,840
additionally you can think about what

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,510
phone calls emails meetings you have

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,790
regularly or frequently that's fine for

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:31,050
milestones eventually you can have your

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:33,090
entire work day or week streamlined most

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,130
want you improve commend you through the

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,950
email or phone call and each type of

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:42,330
inquiry deserves a template so it

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:44,190
worries need so an email template then I

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,410
go down my list of milestones or

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,840
frequent conversations again and have

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,990
all these three for them a phone script

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:55,110
an email template a meeting agenda in

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,900
the meeting agenda I need to ask what's

00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:01,200
my desired outcome what needs to happen

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,120
next so having one type of communication

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,310
can help you write the next well its

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,230
repurposing so if you're in the fog does

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,120
a session you know you're just

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,860
repurposing that's an efficient use of

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,670
your time with Andrew content right

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,650
including the business activities also

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,410
this can help you create a great cold

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,200
call script so cold calls can be really

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,410
scary but if you have your own library

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,240
of resources they can give you the

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,050
confidence you need to make them less

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,750
Airy and more successful now here's a

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,690
response template based on an email or

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,780
online degree or when website designed

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,810
for me I chose the mail merge feature in

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,120
dubspot oh you can easily set this up in

00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,640
a word processor and mail merge data

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,980
from spreadsheet the hey of mail merges

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,940
leader thing you can simply highlight

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,590
the content type and needs

00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,610
and in this case you would highlight

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:03,190
client first name in my template I have

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,640
a personalized greeting because they

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,160
fill their name from the form of our

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,850
website then I acknowledge where they

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,680
contact me for websites and services

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,140
then I make a request for home or

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,210
meeting and include the agenda now they

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,060
know exactly what we'll be discussing I

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,270
laid out the next step which Prime them

00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,790
for yes I've included a link to book an

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:31,210
appointment with me now right now I use

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:34,570
both calendly and a free Google Chrome

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,490
extension called meeting scheduler why

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,960
two different ones I'm just a be to

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,750
split tests right now trying to figure

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,580
out which one works best I also use it I

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,830
use them both at different times to

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,650
figure out is that copying effective or

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,320
they clicking on and strengthen my email

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,570
signature so I used widely and my

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,340
signature and the other is something

00:21:52,570 --> 00:22:00,070
else now we all know we've all been

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,990
there is so frustrating to exchange ten

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,370
emails to book one meeting and sometimes

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,050
then trying to schedule the meeting

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,640
together the last hour into the actual

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,770
meeting so we're just unstoppable this

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,050
is not like I know we think it is it is

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,650
not it's a waste of everybody's time so

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,309
we've got to use something to make

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:21,440
easier so Adam mentioned that I am using

00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:24,559
captain Lee and the meeting scheduler

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,380
both tie it into Google Calendar now

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,870
meeting scheduler and assist tio

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,480
those are both three Chrome extensions

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,520
for those who want to look them up

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,680
Dibble works really well for you when

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,230
you're scheduling meetings with five or

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,809
more people and similar scheduling

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:45,830
services are scheduled isset II hire

00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:48,290
Franklin and okay oh now that we can

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,910
look at meeting easily and quickly we

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,059
need a platform of the virtual ones

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,760
right so it's often easier and more

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,630
convenient than meeting in person in

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,880
person often everyone has had to cram

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,980
around a shared screen right or

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,960
everyone's on their bowstrings when

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,150
they're trying to make sure that they're

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,570
seeing what you're seeing you vice versa

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,150
or providing down the network right so

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,400
nobody can get anywhere and virtual

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,820
meetings can eliminate a lot of this

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,920
confusion so keep this option in mind

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,590
even if you're within walking distance

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,940
and you know I've wasted a lot of time

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,900
thinking that me all the way to be

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:33,490
personable with in person the virtual

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,760
meetings are you get to see each other's

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:39,820
expressions right everyone gets to sit

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,090
their own choosing and both of ours can

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,520
save time with not having to drive a

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,160
park anywhere right and that means

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,770
there's far less disruption in your day

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,820
and one thing we can't get enough of is

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:57,670
time so for virtual meetings that I like

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,330
soon because of its stability and

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,310
flexibility I can use it to meetings and

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,100
trainings and record anything with

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,560
rudolph asses or screen sharing and zoom

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,040
also provides the audio file and a

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,800
separate file so I can use that for

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,280
things like high caste or laid it over

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,500
another video and one way I will assume

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,500
that really gives a lot of value is with

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,870
my free client WordPress basics training

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,090
I host a free training for website

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,340
design Giants after their site has been

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,770
built and that everyone takes advantage

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,510
of it that's okay they have staff to to

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,480
make up in Treme hire me to do it

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,640
however someone more control and to be

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,330
self-sufficient right and they're often

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,740
or corrupt beginners so I love them know

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,620
what front pay and discussion is going

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,540
to be recorded in records at later so if

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,360
I go over something you have a question

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,610
let's save it to the end or just note

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,590
that you can snap it up and they like

00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:00,160
that so then they can think those more

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,780
complex questions and for another time

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:08,920
and not use it there at their hour of

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:09,680
training so I also divide the chocolate

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,180
most and

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,580
he turns down okay i zoom and iff

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,010
transguy what do you use she used in

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,370
screencastify it's the same kind of

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,260
thing you can report a video of your

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,680
desktop screen and review and share it

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,000
and she says she's probably using the

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,830
free version for now that there is a

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,050
subscription fee that at some point may

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:36,070
be worthwhile for visuals for more

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,300
in-depth visual presentations now loo

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,430
offers the same thing

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,760
however it has the added benefit of

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:46,130
having the speaker's face you know the

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,740
video of the speaker in the presentation

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:53,150
wallet video your desktop and that's

00:25:48,740 --> 00:26:00,170
really nice personal touch and these are

00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:02,420
tasks and project management app and

00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,310
they become it begin to use them to keep

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,070
you your projects and your client on

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,840
task now child can be is number of ways

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,940
that the most common way I've seen it

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,340
used is for project management and task

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,070
management for those of you who prefer

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,370
like its daily weekly or monthly view

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,820
without bogging down or messing up your

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,430
main calendar there's a power of their

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,220
power to physical admins called Calvin

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,260
power up in Trello and if you want to

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,630
know about how you can use Trello in

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,600
your business Trello for business comm

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,280
has tutorials and courses you can take

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,400
now the sauna works well for teams and

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,740
managing the team projects some

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,220
designers I know they do use it with

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:52,090
their clients out on the project we do

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,450
things and fun tasks to them with them

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,049
but I find it it works better for teams

00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,820
OmniFocus is

00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,399
it's really growing for managing or

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,360
repetitive tasks that have multiple

00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:06,080
steps

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,090
this is particularly great for

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,850
location-based app my husband for

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,039
example has a location-based task for

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,619
the home improvement store so when he

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,299
goes there he gets an alert for things

00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:20,779
that he needs to do or get long he's

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,369
there I also can be tagged and live for

00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,619
easy organization the church

00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:26,869
now don't is not creating your own

00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:29,119
spreadsheet to get started sooner rather

00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:33,859
than later to keep your overall cost

00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:36,470
loved that is totally fine now Sao Paulo

00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:38,330
has everything from business I could

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,559
list it in every category it is good

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:45,440
good and used for project management so

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,220
keep these tools in mind for home and

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,960
work by the way so when your templates

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,989
are trying to do you're ready to string

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,279
one move even more by automating them in

00:27:53,989 --> 00:28:01,940
a CRM Deb Sato is my current scenario of

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,830
choice I have my template email contract

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,279
proposals questionnaires etc everything

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:10,460
loaded into it and so I've assigned the

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,259
automated tasks after the client clicks

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,080
the buttons right for example my

00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:17,499
proposals at the bottom half accept this

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,529
proposal when they sleep on that button

00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:23,350
automatically does auto generates a

00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:26,530
contract to go with it

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,960
the invoice now if you're using tolling

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,660
to manage other activities you may also

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,200
want to consider adding the harvest

00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,480
power up you can use it for time

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,200
tracking there are several ways to

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,679
automate tasks by the way in Trello now

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,559
time we learn they have an equals eazy-e

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,440
I they have this device where time

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,230
tracking I just got my last week that's

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,020
pretty cool so what I've not liked about

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,720
other time tracking apps that I'm busy

00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,490
working right and then I quickly

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,320
switched to another test or I've got to

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,909
you know focus on the email it's like

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,570
either an important email about another

00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,669
project for the other clients instead of

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,650
clicking into link in my hand off my

00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:14,230
keyboard mouse and thinking around or

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,840
trying to scratch something down on the

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,010
piece of paper I'm working at working

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,960
and I'm working this little an

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,900
eight-sided advice that I have assigned

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,390
tasks to on each side I just work refer

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,850
turn opaque you know there I mean my

00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,730
email I'm do this because I have cheese

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,289
crazy emails on the right and then when

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,720
I'm done with email turn it over

00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:36,820
I've got a phone call okay I'm done with

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,000
that funko get back to work come on logo

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,809
design so that that's a really fun tool

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,980
it is it does cost and there's a

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:50,080
subscription fee but it's worth it to

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:55,049
check out now my favorite my favorite

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:59,169
time of favor is a short a short feature

00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:00,789
fingertips it's short code which is

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:02,740
known as a text replacement in your

00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:06,340
iPhone and because I've set some

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,100
shortcuts or comma and responses or

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,100
if my iPhone it automatically replaces

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,170
the letters that I typed FDC with my

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,950
full website address comments type

00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,050
anymore

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,030
I bet other shortcuts for things like my

00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,340
my cell phone number and then one for

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:24,490
mine my office number and my email

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:28,300
address and here's how it works

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:34,830
I just typed in this one I typed in an

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:36,850
FDC and then my body URL pretty easy and

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,330
after it has leaked wouldn't you just

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,980
have to do a search now he would walk

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,470
through this whole process with

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,260
everybody what do you think your last

00:30:44,470 --> 00:31:05,740
email to a client to officially close

00:30:47,260 --> 00:31:08,110
the project include you want to give

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,179
them when it's fresh and they're excited

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,650
right you want to give them plenty of

00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:13,990
prompts and make it easy give them a

00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,850
link to it you know what your clients

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,400
have to take time to think back to

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,290
remember from long ago if they have to

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,480
think back it's probably likely to be

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,220
done and if it doesn't them is probably

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,250
might be

00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,280
as positive as you like it to be so

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,409

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,840

00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:37,980
better but here they have the option to

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,230
