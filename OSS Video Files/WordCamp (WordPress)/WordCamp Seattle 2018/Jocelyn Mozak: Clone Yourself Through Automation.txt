00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,510
WordPress freelancers and agency owners

helping them to create a business that

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,199
works for them versus the business that

agency all while having two boys at home

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,639
under the age of 13 when I'm not

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,010
speaking or behind your desk playing the

00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:47,039

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,350
espresso we're good at IPA or just

around please join me in welcoming Joe

00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,809
[Applause]

00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:07,680
stereotypical all right guys thank you

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,869
so yeah as I said I the owner down

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Portland Oregon in addition to make

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,300
business potion answers

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,890
professionals today we want to talk to

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,230
you about is pulling yourself through

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,330
automation not about all of this I can

00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,160
actually clone you but that's probably a

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,530
good thing I know having more than me

00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,210
running around would be good but what

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,310
I'm going to talk about is learning in

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,350
the sense of how you can replicate

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,210
yourself so that way you can have more

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,729
time in your business and some of the

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,530
repetitive tasks someone or something

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,460
else can do so that you can focus on the

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,670
fun stuff for the stuff you love button

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,310
so when the top queste is how I leverage

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,600
automation in my own business and

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,000
whatever they take you through it is

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,070
kind of a life cycle or experience of a

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,869
project from learn that comes into the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,090
business and we're going to in and out

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,070
of just touch points along the way about

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,130
relationships with the client showing

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,310
how we can leverage automation the same

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,660
time so we're going to start to being in

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,090
the story and we come over here a little

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,800
closer in my slides and we're going to

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,570
get into the classic question getting

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,739
the email up so how much does a website

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:19,410
cost well it depends right and our goal

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:24,600
is to go from that email to the sales

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,880
call with minimal work so how are you

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,250
gonna do that we're going to reply to an

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,019
email with me now I'm going to say

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,180
something along the lines okay thank you

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,709
for reaching out to provide an accurate

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,730
estimate we're going to leave the low

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,080
more information here's a link to my

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,880
so we're talking about automation it

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,680
already starts to get in place

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,510
I'm not asking questions I'm not putting

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,550
things into it I am sending them to a

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,500
form that was asked for things I need to

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,209
ask when I see pictures being taken just

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,220
you know all of these slides I'll

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,680
provide a link who will be online feel

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,239
free but but also they will be available

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,170
if you guys download these your Google

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,540
clients so that's going to step one

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,060
continue on once complete you'll be

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,340
taken to my scheduling page where you

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,530
can select a time from my calendar that

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,330
works with your schedule I look forward

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,410
to learning more about your product so

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,299
you can already hear some more

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,890
automation we're going from before and

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,600
then we're saying after you've completed

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,220
that form you're going to take me over

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,230
to a calendar or you can pick a time

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,170
that works for you it obviously will

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,610
work for me dig a little deeper into

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,739
this email because we can go a little

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,150
further

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,470
so you'll notice along the way you'll

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,750
see things written in random things

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,910
written in blue green is where you need

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,980
to step or you take an action the goal

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,040
of the wrestling blue automation is

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,010
making the rest just happened so we were

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,090
fighting email using a can email and at

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,890
the end of this talk I'm going to

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,209
actually go in deeper to show the steps

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,709
going through this so right now we're

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,570
kind of getting worsening the high level

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,489
we're setting your flow but that'll

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,700
actually show you how you make this

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,579
happen so we've gone through simply

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,790
getting an email auto reply the

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,470
responses in place thankee we're going

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,350
to take you to your project request form

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,260
alright form rowdy forms and I happen to

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,860
use it lives on

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,450
besides I also like to integrate with an

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,430
email marketing in the software

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,470
I have abused out the campaign and I

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,660
tend to client as a project to request

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,120
submitted

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,680
there's a reason I'm doing that what I'm

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,120
doing is along the way and you'll see

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,850
this through the product I'm kind of

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,800
marking where they are in my flow

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,050
because that allows me to add automation

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,300
that can be conditional on how they're

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,350
behaving providing additional touch

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:44,630
points that I don't have to remember to

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,699
do so once you submit the form you are

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,910
taking my scheduling page now there I

00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,440
use a software so they can schedule it

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,180
great thing about these schedulers

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,699
they're integrated with my calendar so

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,979
it's already we know it's available for

00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,720
me it's a good time for me it'll be

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,560
integrated with their calendar which is

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,229
wonderful

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,449
it sets up to automatically give both me

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,000
and them are reminders that hey there's

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,160
a meeting coming up I can put details in

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,680
that auto minder like me unzoom here's

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,919
the link and finally I tagged it as

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,900
steel is called scheduled so that two

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,789
tags are useful if I can play with them

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,349
for example they submit the form it

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,030
takes to the scheduling page they don't

00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:26,810
do anything late if you know and they go

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:29,360
up now three days can go by the tag of

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,599
skills calls schedule hasn't happened

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,339
well then I can automate an email

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,740
thank you so much for submitting a

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,270
request an implied you're interested in

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,270
those channels because as a cult here's

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,129
my link about three days later nothing's

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,659
happening you know noticed you haven't

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,209
have requests is there are a having

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,009
trouble finding the slot reach out but

00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:52,389
anywhere along the way if they schedule

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,649
the call even those don't happen so what

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,479
we're doing is we're going through the

00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:57,399
first level of automation which is here

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,259
before here's my scheduler abusing two

00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,539
pieces of software we're certainly

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,149
cutting down a lot of correspondence in

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,619
back and forth we can you know make it

00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,869
smoother we can even make it more

00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:09,610
elegant think of the only reaction to

00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:11,289
feeling about connection and that touch

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,449
point of life believe this unions

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,159
schedule here's whatever you can even

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:19,139
have all of those little pieces built

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,139
into you can make it more sophisticated

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,180
we're gonna have a sales call or write

00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,499
those unless you have a sales team don't

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,339
know how to automate that oh sorry

00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,889
you're gonna have to have that

00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,599
conversation there are always help

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,869
proposal oh I do like to use online

00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,360
tools like proposal PI or better

00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:38,979
proposal to to leverage that and at the

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,800
end of the call I have a list of all the

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,180
tools ideas people call presentation all

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,519
the tools they use clout forget that

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,860
question and so now that we have gone

00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,180
and this could go back had the sales

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,869
pope we're going to write the proposal

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,509
and our goal is to get from this calls

00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:59,829
to sign with minimal effort because I'm

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,509
around a little way what we're trying to

00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,279
do is all of these pieces without

00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,559
remembering and we can focus on our job

00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,210
we simply know that we have written a

00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,830
proposal

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,000
wait to go out when we want to get it to

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,500
find and getting them in our system so

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,750
we're proposals this is a part you need

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,789
to do I do like to use online softwares

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,430
like propose a PI that our proposal

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,660
those things are great because you can

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,509
first of all you can see what they're

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,360
doing as they hurry to a proposal and

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,720
you can also be using pieces which the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,520
streamlines your work get amazing tags

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,150
and the attacks because I can state

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,389
proposal sent I can also say proposal

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,699
sign and so that gives me opportunities

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,110
in the middle I want to to weave in

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,699
these emails and I'm not saying you

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,430
necessarily have to build the system

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,020
kind of like dry I would say the first

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,770
time you catch yourself writing these

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,080
emails

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:59,610
it's a cutest a phone and use them just

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,470
repurpose though and so we go from this

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,560
at the proposal and potentially follow

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,240
up with my faith now there's different

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,650
thoughts on how you do the follow up

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,180
some people like to send usable

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,729
information other times you might say

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,020
about my schedules really giving

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,930
you wanna be on it you might want to

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,430
sign that proposal but again you can

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,699
automate these things in the noise the

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,529
tax system or to not send those things

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,969
either way you don't have to remember to

00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,499
do it and that's the best part

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,089
sure is that the proposal get it signed

00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,370
we're going to get the deposit in my

00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:35,419
case mine is hooked in that it collects

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,490
money and we go back here so once they

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,360
paid and that thing we need to do is

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,949
schedule that onboarding call and teach

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,199
all the chaos so we're going to send

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:47,300
them an email along lines of once they

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,620
paint the system knows boom I got money

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,320
next thing I don't care if it's a

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,360
Saturday thank you for the money but if

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,279
it's ball rolling dear client first

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
thing we need to do is to work on your

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,570
website this is schedule the project

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,699
cannot talk yet again go back to the

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,139
calendar we're back to the automation

00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,480
we're back to emails from back to

00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:09,760
tagging so all of these things are ways

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,720
for you to go and leverage these tools

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,100
to make the magic happen

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,050
you know when they signed you want to

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,260
get the gravitation on so excited you

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,980
decide to work with me automated that

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,020
way you know to remembers to it

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:28,860
happens and they get that and they know

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:31,500
the next habits down this next slide is

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,200
the whole reason for this top or what

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,080
got me going on this camp is adding on

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,630
to your system and the gold item to your

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,820
system if you're you know business or

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,560
anything like mine but it's like Amazon

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,780
there's a lot of places I asked them I

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,760
took those off these flat channels out

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,070
of a Dropbox folder well there's my

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,290
contact my to-do list all these things

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,940
and what we're going to do is I was

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,410
finding myself you know going into this

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,880
and filling it out going to that and

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,650
coming out these are simply looking at

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,590
seeing head thoughts was all these are

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,690
looking for is main email brought

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:10,350
company name project name and like

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,020
that's it and so you can utilize tools

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:21,150
like a simple gravity for a connection

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:23,280
app buy clothes if you remember that so

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,140
this is just like a for example this is

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,700
what I set up but simply by using a

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:33,300
single corn zip year I fell out one for

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,540
in my business boo

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,700
slap child is created Dropbox folders

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,250
created they go into my time tracking

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:46,470
they go into my mu easy they go into my

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:48,300
2d tracking done that's automation

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,750
that's cloning yourself as to be one

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:56,400
step and having five results that is the

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,420
sweet spot of climbing yourself yes it's

00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,130
everyone you've done it you know you

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,370
throw a copy of every single time you

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,360
run this flow because it is that amazing

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,910
the other great thing is you know it's

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,770
done consistently correctly right every

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:14,670
single time so now we're going to do the

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,700
work we're going to the client and it's

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,140
time to get some more business

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,930
how many is automation for this well

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,980
again back to the email sequence

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,280
post-lunch

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,620
great opportunity this is simple all you

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,900
need to do is say project launch you

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,690
know what the automation take over about

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,490
a month you know love working with you

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,950
hope you enjoyed us as the set let's get

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,030
that testimony on a link straight to the

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:45,180
DeLorean boom done but a month later you

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,130
know oh but reminder this is great if

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,780
you website means you're posting you

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,520
know hope things are going well I'm sure

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,140
you've logged into WordPress and updated

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,090
all twenty updates innocence appeared

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:59,880
right hey by the way I can do it for you

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,470
interested in the maintenance please at

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,420
the same time you can use your hooks and

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,220
conditional logic to go in there on your

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,950
maintenance plan we not done this email

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,090
and so that's where you want to use and

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,890
how the sophistication in your

00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,840
automation just to continue to refine

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:18,200
and clean up and make that experience

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:22,080
that much better three months out

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,520
working with you've got any prize six

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,140
months out when you're out happy

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,100
birthday can you believe it's been six

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,330
months and you know around nine months

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,890
but the point is is you can very easily

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,950
set up through automation control

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,300
properties you appear in their lives for

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,510
the next year and you're still top up

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,510
night

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,010
so you may be thinking yourself this is

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,510
wonderful what about my kid you just

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,320
gave me a whole bunch of ideas and like

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:55,710
ah about kinds of feedback first time

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,240
ago it was talk and so what I wouldn't

00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,340
take you through is where you could

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,690
start like and this is where it's

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,760
important to realize we're on very

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,430
different places you know our businesses

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,370
I'm 10 years out you know I were finding

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,260
this and I even I always to go and I am

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,340
stepping through this so and the start

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,260
was kind of be like the low-hanging

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,420
fruit like if you're like ok this is a

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,130
great idea but I had Ernst and I go have

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,750
all these emails and oh my god

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,450
we're gonna go through essentially like

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:24,650
the easiest place to start moving for

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,780
the most complex so can't emails easy

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,730
three reason is Google cottage even it's

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,050
built in there's a link toward their

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,240
hand responses you write an email and

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,490
save it next time and this email so

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,460
Amish is a website cost so glad you

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:47,210
asked see if I ever use lighter down the

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:50,670
owner can responses website inquiry boom

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,470
John and so when you're thinking about

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,510
how to you you oughta mean how do you

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,000
start doing this this is as simple as

00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,460
just installing a free add-on to your

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,160
Gmail and that's timing right the email

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,160
say that you've got

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,030
the next one I would say an order of

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
complexity down below email automation

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,870
or sure why people here use MailChimp

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,410
any of those programs right it's as

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,230
simple as dropping the the site launched

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,640
don't let it run so I went and put

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,070
together roughly what it looks like an

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,590
active campaign ok website got lunch

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,220
great wait about a month send them an

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,850
email

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,170
wait about a month now we've got this

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,350
one we're gonna do the maintenance plan

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,300
are they already made this plan client

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,790
if they are let's just send them

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,160
something useful if they aren't by the

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:51,030
way did you know I happen to offer then

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,050
later you want a referral

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,810
can you believe it's been six months

00:14:53,050 --> 00:15:00,880
three months later useful evil twenty

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,770
months later at the birthday yeah this

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,960
is one of those things where you set it

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:14,080
up or get it every time it runs you can

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:17,770
celebrate and here is the automation

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,080
magic this is the super forum this one

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,270
is an example of using gravity forms cup

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,280
there is pain in his paper to be able to

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,640
integrate Savior and they care I mean

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,870
how do people here know of say peer or

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,420
yeah good portion room but not at all

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,180
okay I'm getting couple not sure is so

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,000
basically what I use is my own form of

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,370
my own website i hook in here with my

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,230
harvest and my Dropbox and all of these

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,130
things these are all that's called Zacks

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,810
so say here something like

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,970
where an action comes in that triggers

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,850
another behaviors so in my case the

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,370
action is I submit my own form it says

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,460
something happened and as a result these

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,710
things executed did dig a little deeper

00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,090
into one of them so the way you kind of

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,250
work with state here is you're cooking

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,800
things up so first thing is I'm tying my

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,820
form is a beer so it's like okay and

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,410
connection then I'm guys have my drop

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,750
box sitting here in this case is an

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,850
example of whenever new project comes in

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,470
I automatically community on Fox folder

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,180
so that was talking about organizing

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,210
your folders right I have a very clear

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:25,220
system that always executes the clients

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:27,710
client name project name so be absolute

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,310
client one project one client one

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:35,180
project to client one project three

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:38,570
beautiful systematic organized so I

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,220
connect those two and so that we finally

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,410
we map the fields we say okay there's a

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:46,040
template whenever we do it with an

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,410
active name of the client project and so

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,730
this is this is bougie for gravity forms

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,380
it's basically saying that we're going

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,030
to take the brownie form information and

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,700
we're going to put it into our new file

00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,290
scraps with your Dropbox and I'm only

00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,270
going to show this was an example I will

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,310
be completely transparent and saying

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,140
that not everything you hook up is as

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,270
simple as like here to here some of them

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,310
are fancier but it can start with

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,170
something simple like this and even xizt

00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,600
even the simple fact that this is

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,150
forcing you into being organized to

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:19,420
being consistent to always dominica see

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:21,260
time and smelly on its own right and

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,230
imagine the possibilities

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:29,210
over a thousand apps so I happen to

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:31,190
mention the tools with I use it yeah

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,200
it's mind-blowing and you can have your

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,360
action be as simple as sending an email

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,160
Tuesday here so Xavier has the email

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,840
optional so you know some of the

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,940
fanciness I have with the quorum

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,680
you could probably then even be creative

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:49,100
like the sky is the limit for what you

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,780
can do at this time well I guess you

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,310
guys want to share this the cloning and

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,720
efficiency and automation and all this

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,450
stuff goes together to either to some

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,860
more ways that business hunters you can

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,680
be even more efficient especially as

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:05,150
project owners declutter in your inbox

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,890
those are your best friend that's really

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,360
easy in Gmail right instead of always

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,160
having this stuff had to go to the

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,530
different client names you know after

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,030
clients name name name name right so you

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,190
can quickly scan and just get some of

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,130
the junk out of there but the best way

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,930
is get them out of your inbox and you

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,840
can use for that something like a

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,460
ticketing system the other thing I like

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,930
to do is to build a layer on top of this

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,280
you're getting system because sometimes

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,680
they change what you can exist in my

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,080
music and I like to create my own form

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,400
of my own website you know developer

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,860
grabbing form jumping over here oh

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,380
really a business but what's nice about

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,320
this is we can have interesting fields

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,790
and I love this one this is a ticket

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,190
request form and they can go to my

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,350
website it's okay it's good stuff like

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,090
who are you and what's your website but

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,990
then there's just honest urgency that I

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,760
love how important is this request is

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,940
this like scanner like I'll get to it

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,600
this week is this proxy which may or may

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,700
not have sir

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,920
charge and this is urgent oh by the way

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,910
to do this surcharge of it's urgent so

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,310
at least I really only use the Skype

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:15,770
call ending early opposite used to such

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:18,500
this morning announcement yep every

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,260
friend that does 1 X 1 point 5 2 X is

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,690
pricing whatever works for you the idea

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,120
mean you get it how do the emails just

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,740
coming into your inbox you get it coming

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,390
into your plan your website and you can

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,790
take control where the hackers time

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,320
Vienna and what I've kind of like about

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,910
having this forum in addition to my

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,550
handy-dandy little like is the sky

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:41,090
really form it calling is that I can

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:43,720
also go and as I said if I change how to

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,250
do it on the backend I can then just

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,440
slide it to wherever it's going

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,940
and that gives me flexibility as you

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:55,130
know new shiny objects appear in my

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,780
world another one that's useful that

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,240
they alluded to in my project request

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,250
form and I get questions about that

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,500
and it's tough but there's a couple

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:09,680
questions I like to ask how'd you learn

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,330
about us almost good to know I know I

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,720
was afraid to ask that question

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,600
and so I built in I mean it he didn't

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,250
bigger usually they are but sometimes

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
it's somebody in office doing research

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,140
it's really not a person you want to

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
have a meeting with and I have found

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,480
people answer that truthfully Encino

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,100
which surprised me how do you envision

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,510
impact to your business is this kind of

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,040
just getting her to think about why I'm

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,520
doing this what is the investment in

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,680
this is

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,840
the information I need to when we are

00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,180
having that sales call to understand and

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,700
then this one this one's great

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm getting tired if there's any more

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,220
what's your budget

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,830
what's your investment what are you

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,320
thinking and you in position with this

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,840
line you can have it so the default is

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,820
basically your sweet spot and then I

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,470
like to for smaller budgets turn it as a

00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,000
unique project I mean no you're not

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,520
going to a website that price and by the

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,340
way anywhere to Lotus you don't fill out

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,230
my form and that's just where I have a

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,120
missus you get to places in business

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,610
where budgets are too low likewise

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,290
actually have crazy high and I kind of

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,030
do that with purpose to you in my case I

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,460
believe there are sites that are gonna

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,600
be too high there are like I don't work

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,320
with hundred thousand on my budget

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,750
scares me right now thank you and so it

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,850
kind of really also sets for them to

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,080
know it might in the right thing like is

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,820
this person sort of positioning

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,400
themselves with about why it's not and

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,380
it often does make me

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,390
the right fit client but they'll

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,650
actually don't get tired kickers because

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,420
they look at this in they're like yeah

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,100
we're not going to ask me about a site

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,080
where you know whatever the right number

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:44,010
is only that actually we are all in

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,840
different places in our business

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,790
questions on this the other it gives you

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,590
the information going it's not eating

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,090
you already about Lou thinking like what

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,010
are you willing to invest because you

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,320
clients asked how much does it cost and

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,330
so what I think what in two thousand I

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,730
can hold you twenty those are two very

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,990
different solutions you need to let me

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,550
know what you want to invest in your

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,370
business there only then can I give you

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,020
an estimate that's going to even be

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,860
aligned and don't waste either of our

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,090
times because of your budget isn't close

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,190
to what I can do and then the cuts

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,800
instead of the conversation because okay

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,660
then if that is your budget I'm not

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,520
lowering my price and we tell you what I

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,010
can we deliver for that budget and this

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,190
will be phase one so gives you that

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,190
information

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,580
another thing that is great for you know

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,559
saving time and being efficient is to go

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,210
and do things like this always we use

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,559
the same tool suite running on steam

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,850
course and learning the latest and

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,580
greatest and it's a waste of your time

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,730
right get your tool set that you know

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:50,050
that you understand know it well use it

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:52,510
and and just that is your go-to have a

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,400
seed site so I have my go juice I have

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,620
them set up an area that's always kept

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,780
up to date and so whatever new project

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,260
comes in is in my systems and prophecies

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,540
hotel document

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,400
this week alone it we've seen it all the

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,440
plugins are off as we need them we turn

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,669
our favorite plugins on at launch

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,679
anybody who's off gets deleted done

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,510
because I will tell you I do remember

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,679
the days where even though I knew better

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,260
I just think they're installing

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,890
WordPress and add in plug-in one and two

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,850
and three stupid but I did it so I'm

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:29,650
gonna sue I'm not the only one only no

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:32,809
host oh these hosts you know and love so

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,370
how given you guys a waste of time and a

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,169
setting where you're like where is my C

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,840
panel but the hell is this you know like

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,720
oh my god what was this bill this is not

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,820
a hosting company it wastes so much of

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,130
your time right and so the client has

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,400
some options one they can switch to one

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,650
you like to they cannot work with you or

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,540
three come up with a number that's

00:23:51,650 --> 00:24:01,429
really big that is worth that pain and

00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:03,049
suffering something I've been loving

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,330
I've been moving all my clients over to

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:08,270
one of those in my case right now I'm

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,980
using WP engine for me they're great

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,290
because I love the fact that their tech

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,540
supports really responsive they've got

00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,220
all of those speed issues you know the

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,809
polish of that and as a client gets

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,110
hacked it sticks like for me it's just

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:23,450
like easy it's simple my team knows it

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:26,900
we know it and it's just like it's just

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,440
easier and so I was there just

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,480
most of my clients over what I want and

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,710
then really automation all this stuff if

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,830
you take anything away from this

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,720
presentation it's a mindset it's when

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:43,820
you do things and you do it once you go

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,530
okay you do it twice you vote you three

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,620
times there is a better way because if

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,180
you can itemize what it is step by step

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,310
either a totally do it or someone else

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,680
can do it for everyone in this room your

00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,380
time is too valuable for you to be doing

00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,360
it that zapier exam always started all

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,640
for me writing my systems and processes

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,800
for a BA I was like because that's one

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,360
important thing you hire you can't just

00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,940
throw it over the fence it is your

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,530
business you do need to come up with how

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,380
we're going to work around here what is

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,210
the flow what are the expectations a lot

00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,980
of times I save myself time by just

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,900
doing like a little video I'll just put

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,270
on my headphones on screen record and

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,980
let somebody else deal with documenting

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,690
it they can spend five hours turning it

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,490
into an official document I only want

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,490
one 15 minutes doctor might think this

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,110
is what I want but I found myself as I

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,480
was figuring out the steps where I went

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,690
wow I don't even actually need a person

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,780
to do this there's a tool that can do it

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:43,580
but again it's it's a mindset an

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,380
automation and all of these things it's

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,090
like teaching your kids how to tie their

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,760
shoes right there's gonna be some

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,320
upfront time when you guys playing with

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,670
colleges or kids so you can tie their

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,620
shoes yeah take the time you will

00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:03,350
celebrate every single time they tie

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:05,000
their own shoes so I added this and I

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,270
get these questions what are the tools

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm using and do know these change but

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,290
these are the tools I'm using right

00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,300
do not use all of this and so that's why

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,640
I practice a lot of yourself my started

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,850
as lifting as free and simple as you're

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,570
using Google Gmail right you don't need

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,100
to be this fast

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,500
you don't need to discuss together these

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,280
things come like cost now I will argue

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,900
how much is your time worth so always

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,130
look at these things going in ten

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,800
dollars here's what we know is there

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,170
that adds up but sometimes it's okay

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,240
that's up you need to have your numbers

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,800
in your business and wedding plans I've

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
heard me talk about business I get all

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,640
the probabilities so pop because it's

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,850
important you know some expenses are

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,900
good what you you know bill is good and

00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,850
the difference needs to be a positive

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,950
number but as I mentioned Napier bookies

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,650
what I'm using right now better

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,410
proposals active campaigning on other

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,880
things and the other things I'll touch

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,790
on this faction prime or value

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,070
multiplied an AWP is what I'm using

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,110
right now to really manage all my

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,940
maintenance sites and to use my seat

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,860
site to clone it's kind of instead of

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,010
going into different installs to see

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,360
where things are it pulls it into a hub

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,390
does other things like daily backups

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,630
that's really useful

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,910
you already know idle gravity farms

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,150
no status to people in the community

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,400
who've been you know instrumental in my

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,290
journey through my business you never

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,940
know in some ways who to thank for what

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,250
and just know that you've arrived and

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,530
they've been on your journey and so to

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,200
the ones I will mention is Jennifer born

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:44,480
a quote project plan she's got an

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,690
amazing program where she really dips

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,370
into all of the email correspondence

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,590
that you can do as you move through a

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,230
project and she's part of the reason I

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,190
think for kind of my mind flipping and

00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:00,350
starting to zero in on these things

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,710
WP elevation with Tori Dean he's also an

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,210
amazing program of about

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,440
online WordPress professionals who more

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,360
than that technology that program

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,000
probably like three four thousand really

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,950
and that is also a lot of seeing

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,920
yourself with the business and that's

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,780
valuable and then these tools were real

00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,330
these books are really good for me those

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,230
to sell this boy work the system's free

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:25,430
I didn't read traction I kind of got to

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,990
development firm out by the time they

00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,480
got there but I do know it's a great

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,030
resource on it but all these help you

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,800
how do you think about your business in

00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,540
a way of automation and the way it can

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,490
run without you because it is so

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,410
important as business owners that we

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,300
have these systems in place we owe it to

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,550
ourselves we get it out of our own time

00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,980
we owe it to our clients that they can

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:48,470
always expect consistent product from us

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,540
and I like to say these things for you

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,760
but this automation was great I wouldn't

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,860
spoken conference in Canada these things

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,390
were just running my exciting among cats

00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,830
thank you and they were scheduling and

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,350
all this was running while I was busy

00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,930
focus even on my conference that was a

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,270
planned escape or vacation for my

00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,430
business whatever you get back are like

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,860
what if I get stay what if I'm out for

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,720
any reason all of these places where we

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,030
add automation we were really looking at

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,760
what does a product that goes to our

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:21,020
business look like how's it done what

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,760
can our customers count on from us it

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,760
can we owe it to them as we mature

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,720
because that's a business for me I know

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,990
that was a huge step as I went

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,030
to remind sent to an agency but I wonder

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,409
if even I was a freelancer still owed

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:39,990
the same thing even though I'm not sure

00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:40,980
I was thinking in that mindset so that's

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,309
what I got for you today

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,960
that's weird kind of fast but do you

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,510
guys have any questions for me anything

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,169
I can answer around the business

00:29:48,510 --> 00:30:00,230
automation all of this stuff later the

00:29:52,169 --> 00:30:05,030
dough do I find that catch monsters

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:07,980
actually soon no that blows me away I

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,140
have like C email lose what's funny

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,260
about the lay person again we see all

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,240
and so the camera sponsons absolutely

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,770
not because it's coming from Gmail so it

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,240
doesn't have like the little message at

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,600
the bottom that's coming from that

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,909
server

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,409
we need your clients don't because I

00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,090
have some emails that earn my

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,860
automations like a newsletter sequence

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,240
like hey dude are you doing any problems

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,429
and they were fly like I just wrote them

00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,860
a personal email I'm like oh okay I

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:37,919
forgot that was Audrey so the answer is

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,570
no and honestly I don't know I guess the

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,940
flip would be you look at the value and

00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,620
the role modeling you're doing your role

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,770
modeling I'm a professional that has a

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,350
system I've got you I'm not we mean this

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,169
I'm not making this up as I go this is

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,330
how we move through my business so I

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,400
guess it's like everything else how you

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,010
look you're everything you're seeing the

00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,809
chief

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:04,299
see me right there benefiting from it

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,280
and that structure and that stuff that

00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:07,780
confidence you're instilling is really

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,830
priceless because they're coming to you

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,809
because they need your help because

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,610
maybe they tried to do it themselves

00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:18,720
and they figured out this is not my

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:18,720
wheelhouse it's yours yes yeah

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,510
piggybacking onto that question do you

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,400
ever take the opportunity to add into

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,679
your canned responses a little personal

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,809
message you know just to make a little

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,030
more personal like you know your canned

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,950
response here and that oh I really love

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:40,570
dogs this would be a fun site to work

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:46,090
with you on yeah I mean I suppose in

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:48,520
some way thank you it kind of sank I

00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,980
mean I think I can edit them sometimes

00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,480
but usually I don't need to the other

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,880
thing I'll say is sometimes ice left the

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,340
order so this is an interesting thing

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,250
from so ordered meaning like the sales

00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,990
call versus the fill out my request for

00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,880
it so for example if you're in a

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,980
position where you're like I am busy I

00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,830
can't even have a one more lead right

00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,390
now go to the sales you know fill out

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,090
the form I'll make you jump through my

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,010
foods right if I more in the space of

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,720
like kind of more flexible with the

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,640
leaves I'd like more people to talk to

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,620
you then it's like a scheduled call with

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,150
me and then I'll say to prepare for our

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,710
call I'd really like you to fill out

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,049
this form so I have the information I

00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,460
need because the port is a barrier to

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,289
entry I mean I see

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,960
one thing I think with horns is that you

00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:33,789
only ask this essential to short to long

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,320
as you know so like if I'm in that space

00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,779
run like I want more leads and it's a

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,370
nice tight form of I want you please

00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:41,679
fill this out if you don't pull it out

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,289
then I can decide if I'm gonna force the

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,120
issue likewise again if I'm in the

00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,669
position of you know buyers market

00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,260
seller's market then I can be a little

00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,520
bit more like no you're going to hop

00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,350
through my coops and you're going to

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,110
only done am I going to cause I'm busy

00:32:53,350 --> 00:33:07,720
and so I do want to play with that based

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:09,340
on where I'm at my business yes yeah and

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,110
then the other question is after the

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,960
year that you outlined up your

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:16,690
follow-ups do you continue that process

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,620
or do you have any suggestions on how

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:23,380
often you contact plans alright so why

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,539
after campaign um it's working for me

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,340
and again it's like I like to use for

00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,990
the tags and the ability you know mail

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,610
itself I think how's that now at the

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,679
time male term didn't have as many nods

00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,110
to twist and so it's like most things

00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,880
right you're looking at price point

00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,250
functionality and I'm a firm believer

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,070
that really knowing your flow is more

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,990
important than your tool if you really

00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,350
know your flow and then that's what's

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,480
timeless the tool can change and happen

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,250
as well so that's kind of the answer to

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,309
that it's it meets my needs at a price

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:58,990
and weight I can tolerate beyond the

00:33:54,309 --> 00:34:02,320
year honestly then they're more dropped

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:05,409
on my normal list which adds inflows how

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,850
much I can attach into it that's the

00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,250
trick I mean I should say this is that

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,859
even we only have digital work in

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,659
process at progress this is the polish I

00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,710
have to date it could always be better

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,230
it has

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,659
worth we're all moving the needle

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,820
forward so I don't know if they're right

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,859
you know responses I've been told ask

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,109
for girls about every six months which

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:27,849
to me feels like a lot but I think

00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,290
sometimes we forget and we feel like

00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,879
we're always both of them they've got so

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,580
much noise it probably don't even hear

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,859
what we found them so I guess maybe

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,270
that's very amy test I have John that

00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:38,530
sometimes and some of my things we're

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,830
all like suddenly come to a point and

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,330
say like okay 50% bother and 50% give

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,790
them another six months off and I kind

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,960
of go look at how the data shakes out

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,339
but we all know there are days where

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,609
we're analyzing or business in days

00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:52,540
where we're just working it and yeah

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:58,000
that's the truth

00:34:52,540 --> 00:35:00,400
right yes so you can't use your CRM or

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,280
do you have another CI I don't really

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,800
have a Sierra right now I mean as far as

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,000
you know lead stuff I mostly and they

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
know that's the wrong answer

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,800
they supposed to be the wrong answer I'm

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,420
supposed to have Sierra I have my plants

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,760
and harvest so I thought their their

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,410
name their email their business and

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,430
stuff so I have that respect as far as

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,080
like needs to do pipe one and on I have

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,550
another how he needed to get there I've

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:34,180
always been pretty busy with my business

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:38,470
and so I just happened and the question

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,609
for me you guys good or you know the

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,609
second day after you know

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,260
yes yes

00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:51,230
so harvest is good for me because I use

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,060
it for I put all of my name in the nurse

00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,810
about five years one wish yes don't get

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,140
expensive but we don't do sometimes and

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,790
so yes means it for invoicing and

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,540
billing it's nice because I can see like

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:07,220
my team I used to work for my project to

00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,000
do list tracking they they play nice

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,220
together

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,839
so my team has search doulas they'll

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,970
just put their time and harvest I can

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,950
see very easily who spent how much time

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,859
on what or my project cost what am i

00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:21,470
building out so it works well for me

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,970
people use fresh books 5s for 17 hats

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,849
because I think that's great for the

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:28,460
solo business owner it doesn't scale for

00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:31,280
teams but it does look like a great

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,859
solution if you are so low so harvest is

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,690
what I'm using again I think it was

00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:38,540
cheaper than fresh books was gonna kind

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:43,369
of pricey it's against where I'm at it

00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:45,410
works and that I used so great to do

00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,960
this I use keyword Johnny he's making up

00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,210
Sam that to me it's like what's really

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,400
well for internal conversation I like

00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,290
that I set up a channel for every single

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,579
project so it's kind of like you've got

00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,250
your train to thought we used to all

00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:00,290
just be free for all in skype who's

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,730
talking about what right this way we

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,670
have some structure so there's a

00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,500
conversation we know what's going on

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,599
again Dropbox happens to be what I knew

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,869
is Google arrived at work priced well we

00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,890
work as well but I really am loving my

00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:20,140
automated file structure that has been

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:22,180
really really nice for me just drop offs

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,309
and just so what I did with something as

00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,579
simple as what you say simple they get

00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:29,559
it you know it's useful clients client

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,720
name project name and so you just have

00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:37,359
this very organized you know how to find

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:39,609
stuff and that's that's the thing is

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,890
sound you know on that I was speaking

00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,359
it's like of a lot of these things just

00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,099
kind of come up with a system and lean

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,930
into it knowing you might pivot you

00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,339
might change that's okay but just lean

00:37:46,930 --> 00:38:01,539
into it and start moving the needle

00:37:48,339 --> 00:38:03,490
forward yes we showed up well I'm not is

00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,619
the thing and that is the biggest piece

00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,150
that I like spells in to get sharing

00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:09,940
this all with you and why I say and do

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,289
this for 10 years you know and even that

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,210
doesn't even mean anything necessarily

00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,130
you know this is something I probably

00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,990
haven't see in the last you're gonna

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,750
have eyes really been on this like

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,609
awareness as I moved into an agency fi

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,319
between coaching as ever doing more

00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,089
speaking has gotten more out of my

00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,910
business I don't realize the necessity

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:30,099
of this see what it's just you you hold

00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,779
it all on your head but then when you

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,450
start having a team they need to know

00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:36,819
how to be successful what's expected and

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,279
also I wasn't really starting to realize

00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:42,430
like what what a product leaves my

00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:46,000
agency what checks should happen and it

00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:48,789
shouldn't be like oh shoot did I I think

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,380
I did this one that's not he could use

00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:52,979
some time

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,829
feels are professional and so while it

00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:57,749
was me stepping into saying I need to be

00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,970
a grown up here and what does a grown-up

00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:01,769
look like and then I decided that I

00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:05,130
hadn't see coming was the benefit the

00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:07,920
relief you get when you do start to do

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,799
this I don't probably don't have time oh

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,289
I don't have time I have later slide

00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:16,799
down but I advise we didn't actually

00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:19,890
mention this continues on hold this part

00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:22,829
out but I did you actually a full-blown

00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,299
Google website of my business and so I

00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,890
would what I do and I look at my

00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:28,380
workflow like one of the workflow we

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,299
have sales onboarding discovery design

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,519
development launch up to what are the

00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:34,289
pieces and so what I did is instead of

00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,690
going really deep in my document to talk

00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,880
to do to know and why I said okay these

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,910
are the why things and then ice type of

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,869
background so this example is having to

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,930
go out on board

00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:47,670
so okay onboarding what does onboarding

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,769
look like well I'm going to time the

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,109
welcome email do the peacock call add

00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:54,599
the clients to my tools okay

00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:56,400
was it so love when we know like well

00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,569
I'm going to use the mailing list cool

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm going to have this trigger it's

00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:01,349
gonna look like this it's gonna look

00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,210
like that and so how I approach this

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:04,589
stuff is instead of going super deep and

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,440
just having like one thing done and be

00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:09,690
like oh my god I'm exhausted I instead

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,009
have been taking it in my paces through

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,140
my business I'd be like here's my

00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,280
workflow and at least I had that

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,560
documented

00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,660
plus when I said all right for each step

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,920
with my workflow what are the sub points

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,780
and I went through and did that and I'm

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,360
like okay I'm not much deeper and I

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,520
cycle back around and what I was careful

00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,500
of I'm in the workflow as to there is a

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,020
difference between like the leads of I'm

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,540
using harvest and the workflow in the

00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,150
system of I put them in an invoice tool

00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,940
and so the invoicing tool will always be

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,800
true harvest may change and so when I

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,870
sort of deadly systems and proxies I

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,960
kept it very much at this high level of

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:48,080
what if I really take a step back what

00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,130
am i doing I'm putting them in

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,660
communication tools I'm putting you in

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,330
this type of tool and I've got the tool

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,920
so I kind of differentiate it at the and

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,290
here's how you put it in the tool we'll

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,970
move over to really deep versus this

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,680
timeless information which theoretically

00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,660
almost always be true for my business

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,030
and then what I would do is went to a

00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:09,000
Google Doc which went into the leads but

00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:11,070
that was how I helped myself not get

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,980
completely overwhelmed by trying to take

00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,750
this incredible amount of stuff that was

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,630
in my head and get it out of my hand

00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,610
paper without just getting like so down

00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,590
this one and being like well I've done

00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:26,120
it's like we clean your calves are all

00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:26,120
excited about the one where you clean

00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,989
[Applause]
