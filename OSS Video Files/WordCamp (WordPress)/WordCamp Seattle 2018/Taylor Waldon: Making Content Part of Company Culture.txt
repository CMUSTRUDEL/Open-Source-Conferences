Title: Taylor Waldon: Making Content Part of Company Culture
Publication date: 2020-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	The days of static website content are dead. Creating dynamic content should be a cornerstone of any good digital marketing strategy. The content you produce not only draws potential customers in, it shows leadership in your industry, not to mention the SEO benefits associated with it.
The need for content production goes deeper than having something to post on your blog, Facebook, or Twitter that week. It’s about strategizing with your entire team to make sure the content you produce supports your product or service and provides real value to your online audience.
In order to work with a team, you need a solid content process in place. Moreso, you need to create company culture that includes content creation.
In this talk, we will cover the following topics:
– The Importance of Regular New Content
– Setting up a Process
– Getting your Team Invested through Company Culture
– Re-Adjusting your Process to Fit your Team
– Reporting to your Team
Attendees can expect to learn the value of good content, how to create a company culture that includes content creation as a team, and setting up a process for content creation that fits your team’s workflow.

this is so like I said I'm going to tell

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:59,300
you what actually starts with my story

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,870
so I would like very much since I

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:06,110
discovered WordPress when it was really

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,109
young also and I were blogging Emerson

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,460
so in college I worked for the food

00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,580
service company on the buzz campus

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,990
opportunity to be their marketing intern

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,200
at this point I've never done anything

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,270
in writing professionally so my first

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,909
project with that was actually to

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,040
address the pr HC little blog they had

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,540
issues with students needing them and

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,110
they're a food service company in a

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,520
college campus so that wasn't good and I

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,440
said hey let's start block with

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,880
adductors from the inside and tell

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,409
people be more transparent what we're

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,270
doing it worked

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,770
so that was my first experience starting

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,119
blog and it's super successful in

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,940
industry

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,440
part of that was the team on my side who

00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,899
who cared and think wanted to help

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,840
contribute to the content us forward

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,360
like a few years I was in grad school I

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,950
started treatment thing and every pump

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,270
dealer they worked for it was like it

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,119
was like pulling teeth trying to get

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,830
content from them to write for them but

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,500
those some things but I did have on my

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,569
side dental creating content with me Bo

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,880
it helped a lot more in the context of

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:15,269
cider and it was successful it actually

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,579
didn't expose to do that I wouldn't

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,670
forget we're on that is already part of

00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,320
our maple share which was a possum I had

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,630
never been in a company more where

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,890
people like configuration was actually

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,239
part of something that they wanted to

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:38,400
keep doing and make sure was Donna

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:43,230
regular basis so I'm sharing on this

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,780
topic but why you publish your process

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,000
getting your team invested readjusting

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,720
your process and therefore your team all

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,010
was a really important point work

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,570
seem for your content so the first and

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,060
most important question is why do you

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,250
need to publish content on your website

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,510
like I said game console when I was

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,560
bringing them there was like pointy

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,250
because they didn't understand the

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,290
importance of it but truthfully the most

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,170
basic answer is help people find you and

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:15,100
if it's correct a experiencing it gives

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,540
people trust in your company so the

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,970
other reason that's out the Davis static

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,430
content dead Google doesn't wake you

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,860
just one thing in one day all the time

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,390
constantly your SEO score is under

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,810
mountain because nobody's visiting your

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,760
site and they're you know Alliance and

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,090
also social media has just turned us

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,950
into to content like machines we just

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,930
stick on that constantly all day every

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,410
day and it's constantly taking so our

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,970
attention span is really small so we

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,260
need work on them because somebody's

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,420
gonna see one thing get bored in five

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,700
seconds move on to the next when you

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,640
publish content regularly and often they

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,340
actually let people know what to expect

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,230
from you and then it helps you like new

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,610
people find it easier because if you're

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,250
publishing and regularly than those

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,140
people who are regular viewers of your

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,519
content will share more and more

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,110
invested in it also because they know

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,120
that

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,320
you're already looking for it but

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
actually helps bringing new readers

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,240
because they're sharing their content

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,459
and of course the content helps with

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,410
your organic traffic new site because

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,280
that's how Google finds you in searches

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,280
for the words on your site

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,330
like I said publish regularly you don't

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,830
have to publish every week you don't

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,360
have to publish every day but publish

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,950
regularly and let your readers know what

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,950
to expect on e so if you have a company

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,980
that is like a walk here from meeting

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,080
you talk about Times blog publish by

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,630
length every other ones just put a post

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,669
up something to keep your content moving

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,740
on your site and of course there's no

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,620
time and humans all the time I don't

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,910
want I'm sorry but I thought kinda low

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,830
but nobody has spikes blog if you create

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,630
process you will actually save yourself

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,550
a lot of time so in starting working

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,230
with a content team is working by

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,330
yourself creating a process and knowing

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,990
how you want it done so any what you're

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,850
in publish so first start with the

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,590
workflow pick pick a fine line this is

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,540
15 days before publishing and spanning

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,370
we actually plan our content length

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,930
months in advance and then you write it

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,360
later on this is this is just but click

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,710
aside to plan nobody you want know what

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,990
you want to publish ahead of time and

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,500
then write it and then walk away from it

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,000
and then go back and edit it no one you

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,950
want some pretty graphic Sun and what

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,990
you need done playing out in advance and

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,729
then make sure you go back perform at it

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,729
check it for money make sure it looks

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,530
good on your site and I recommend

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,570
editing one more time 19 for my tubes

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,660
once it's on your site you actually

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,970
you'll see the remains so go ahead and

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,600
one more time and then publish so know

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,190
when when in your process you want

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
those things that we never miss a

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,830
deadline also you're going to save

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,210
yourself time because we already know

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,210
what tasks you have to do beforehand

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,990
this is my concept matrix so this is how

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,280
you're going to basically determine to

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,520
what you're going to publish at all

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,350
times on the top is these are so many

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,550
different examples and ways that you can

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,940
use we use again we're educational and

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,760
approachable and with WP visitor views

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,980
were more informative and left a little

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,190
more casual so they're different they're

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,800
very similar but they're different in

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,840
the actual matrix matrix itself you have

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,970
sales six on the left and the type of

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,510
cars on top some people call those

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,430
personas so I like to start with the

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,500
sales let's determine why somebody's

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,490
going to use your your product or

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,020
service over another so why would

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,400
somebody use your plug-in that does the

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,980
exact same thing when I'm going funding

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,410
this or why doesn't use your marketing

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,700
service when there's hundreds of others

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,880
out there what do you have to offer that

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,200
so meals doesn't one that one I thought

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,630
of here is actually keeping up with the

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,650
Joneses so we have really expensive

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,570
services or products but they're really

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,790
cool they're awesome you can actually

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,280
exploit that in your content and talk

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,570
about how some anything's better than

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,580
their front because they have your

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:27,890
product once you have your sales hooks

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,870
you're actually gonna build personas so

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,520
don't would say on science or business

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,340
on business

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,400
fully different depending on who they

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,319
are you might have and ideal customers a

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,419
business owner that's not tech savvy

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,860
that's what does a key point there there

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,569
he's not tech savvy has different

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,849
interests from a business owner who may

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:50,900
be tech section and you're gonna talk to

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:53,120
them different name so knowing who

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,340
you're talking to down on that level is

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,699
really important I like to actually

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,650
create names and people so it's almost

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,680
like a fake profile and you're talking

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,389
to that specific person once you have

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
all that the across key messages so this

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,970
is kind of the hard part but can you

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,479
alter what you're saying for the same

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,430
concept and getting our legs so let's

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,349
say you're a monkey monkey and you're

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,180
trying to sell to like a 22 year old

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:24,110
male and you're also trying to sell to

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:28,009
it 35 as one single on the 20 viral male

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,409
is going to be on the goes among his

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,140
friends and he's going to be probably

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,700
more invested in like going out into

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,140
anything

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,940
the mom can't wanna spend time with her

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,740
family she's going to how you trust and

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,589
she's only one nature should hire

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,640
somebody but they're falling so you

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,160
could probably talk to them differently

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,450
you use convenience if you want to be if

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,279
you need it for both of them you could

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,740
that human states between my marrow male

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,750
see so time more time with your friends

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,430
who want to stay here if you want from

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,690
35 year old mama not going to say that

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,070
you're going to say okay so then

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,860
partners and family there these would be

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,300
fun let us compare you want so just the

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,920
way we say that it is different but it's

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,580
the same concept here you're talking

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,580
about convenience

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,140
once you decide all of the backgrounds

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,810
you can also know the template so we

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,660
have something that looks this is

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,100
exactly design method and I fill this

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,839
out every single time and whether or not

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm writing a post or somebody else's

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,560
they have this in front of them to know

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,640
what words are going with it why if

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,050
they're doing it it's important to have

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,180
three things like narrating work your

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,190
offer and value is probably the most

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,160
important that's why your readiness why

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,570
are you writing speaks what's the point

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,040
your target audience is important to

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,320
take that persona which one are you

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,980
talking to and talk to them specifically

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,690
and then the keyword keyword even forty

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,329
but it's important to remember not to

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,529
stuff it and not to overthink it diggity

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:00,390
where it keep in mind

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:02,070
music you're not forcing the rest of

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,500
them who they're important they just

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,050
kind of help us organize but if you

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,519
create something like this

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,779
and you sit down to read oh so you're

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,970
going to save yourself time because it's

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,410
not coming up with the same stuff over

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,939
and over you already have in front of

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,769
you they're making selections based on

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,769
what you've already done makes it fun

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,939
lastly on this section is or having all

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,399
of that so you have all all of these

00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,319
things they're everywhere keep them in a

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,079
folder and then you have to organize

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,629
your calendar the free way to the United

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,420
excuse Google Drive and use calendar and

00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:42,649
Excel spreadsheets and Google Docs and

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,569
everything we used to do this and we

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,269
have a fourth one branch it's actually

00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:49,339
almost impossible to keep up with so I

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,040
are like oh schedule because it

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,779
integrates with WordPress and you can

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,489
schedule out your social media posts and

00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,989
it functions as a full project

00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:01,429
management system basically for

00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:03,110
contouring time tasks plan up content

00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:07,459
you can even say marketing campaigns but

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,809
it's a little bit more crazy so no

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,129
matter what make sure you're organizing

00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,470
it if you're using an Excel spreadsheet

00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:17,629
great do that but just make sure you can

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:22,189
pop it if you tell me looks like mine

00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:29,839
you need it and that's actually it's

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:32,240
pretty late so you did all fabulously

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,799
you know what you want or your mom knows

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,299
what he wants publish how you want to

00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,949
publish change about a workflow now you

00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:40,130
know how you're gonna work maybe you've

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:41,360
written a couple posts yourself

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,400
involved because you're not the expert

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:51,560
on every single subject female range

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:54,920
you're making actually used to whenever

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,770
for complex where I used to sit down at

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,210
the counter and wait for the cashier who

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,970
was the only person who knew anything

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,440
about her promise to be free and in

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,180
between is customary I would sit there

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,530
and say what somebody's saying I'm

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,510
asking about what they just told me

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,250
about or a new product and get all the

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,720
information and go read folks on it and

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,550
then bring it back to me have him edit

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,200
it and tell me what was wrong with it or

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,740
what bourbon sounded dumb because I'm

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,900
not woman and writing that sounded weird

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,460
and so that right there is why I

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,650
emphasize working with the team because

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:30,140
if you've written on himself and then I

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:32,330
edited who have put up so much time so

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,040
everybody does a leader just because it

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,050
was a team effort doesn't mean but

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,610
somebody wants right Sony does need to

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,500
organize your counter

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,180
you know what topics are writing about

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,649
how you're writing about them and how

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,000
they will be distributed and then of

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,810
course publishing posting and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,720
distributing so he needs to do that they

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,279
really can't do it all like I said while

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,870
I was working at that place or I

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,450
was threatening it literally running

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,560
back and forth between the offices

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,140
pretty far because that's a bit of big

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,220
warehouse and it wasted a lot of time so

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,120
this is our team

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,709
I use my dream strengths so better rates

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,930
tutorials videos on our support so he

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,329
knows the plug-in inside and out he

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,010
knows how to do all of the things that I

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,720
might want to teach somebody to do and

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:25,640
he has all the tools to do it and create

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:27,140
the screenshots and then Rochelle if I

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,850
had a customer success so if you know a

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,620
lot about fundraising and nonprofits and

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,820
she talks to them on a daily basis so

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,850
she knows what they're thinking about

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,070
and she found something a lot of great

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,959
qualities three nonprofits she also

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,240
comes up without that boss uses forgive

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,680
because she use it so much but she'll be

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,540
like hey this was a great way to use it

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:51,230
to write a post on that Amanda there's a

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,940
lot about SEO in our team so I she

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,199
helped a lot with our W key this is her

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,499
news blog and she's written a lot of

00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,379
content there she also wrote

00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:00,849
nonprofits while I probably could have

00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,339
written that amanda has a lot more

00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:06,869
technical things than I do and using her

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,869
strengths there was perfect

00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:16,209
Kevin Kevin is load up with altercation

00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,859
of 11 he rates all over there's a lot of

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:23,739
development based blog stuff about

00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:26,079
Gutenberg WordPress for the content that

00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:28,479
not great not great community and

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,969
product instead of set of support he's

00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:33,339
also tend to be outreach so here at

00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:35,999
Glencoe WordPress our product on some

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,669
more tutorials and things like that so

00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:42,959
my tuck is take all of these people and

00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:45,609
heard them I need to read the text

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,829
because it's not part of their daily job

00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:49,719
ordered normal job let's just write the

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:51,639
book so I might have a quote book six

00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:54,249
times being able to start writing hey

00:14:51,639 --> 00:15:00,429
terrific it is your eighth it now okay

00:14:54,249 --> 00:15:02,319
great book let's do better cut anything

00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,639
that nothing is going to stay all the

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:07,779
same time we need to eat stablish a

00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:10,419
meeting so go back and figure it out

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,929
what works with your team your any old

00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:15,039
sign that it's not going to be your hand

00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:22,689
especially if you work the development

00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:24,879
remember that okay so then to keep your

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:27,129
team invested for for back to them

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,680
nobody's inherited giving you stuff and

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,360
I never hear back about it

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,830
they would hear what their content it

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,510
that they read great folks that somebody

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,790
planted on and since it's a hot summer

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:41,320
that was shared on social media and

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,959
really helps somebody let enough use the

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,209
numbers put a chart on them show them

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,750
what the content is doing so that that's

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,700
still invested because weeks go by and

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,730
people to forget you know keep them

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,070
invested report regularly use all of the

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,380
data so website analytics you're gonna

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:05,170
look at use your time on the page your

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:06,640
bounce rating and excavate your time on

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,600
the page is really key for content

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,149
because you want to know if actually

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,769
reading it if they're not and you have

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,500
like two seconds on the page you have

00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,200
like a thousand views and there's really

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,800
no point because they're not staying on

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,420
page they're reading social media you

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,190
want to know about engagement makes

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,880
chairs reach it depends on your goal

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,070
which of these is more beneficial or

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,200
more important for your company but for

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,270
we are afraid of your team they want to

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,800
know how much their goes for share your

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,250
how many people light thing because that

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,720
means something good and then email

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,920
statistics let them know he'll be

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,700
emailed it when you send it out

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,070
subscribers

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,350
part of your fax to so what I want even

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,060
profiling how many people liked it and

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,060
how it's doing social media

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,209
so my whole point is teamwork is the key

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,089
to a successful content strategy

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,439
really you can't you came you can try to

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,429
publish it all yourself you can write it

00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,679
earlier so if you can do it all yourself

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,089
but the reality is it's probably not

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,750
your main dog and probably doing

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:19,150
something else and in order to actually

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,000
make it part of your culture it has to

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,530
be a team effort so and I also recommend

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,240
hiring a writer if they're not a writer

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,760
hire a writer to help you at least

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,500
organize it it's not grand living with

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,440
your best friend because it'll tell you

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,030
doing you write something them and I

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:40,350
love great money but it's not only very

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,350
I never so good fun right yes

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,700
yeah so I think I left it all the way

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,110
from lip but the call action he's

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,490
writing with the purpose of people

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,950
you're right and so if we want to send

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,490
them to an event that is a home action

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,470
in a female in your funnel where where

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,850
where they coming from where they're

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:32,750
going to do it where you want them lined

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:35,030
up yeah well then it looks perfect I I

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,690
would say don't call action and even a

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:41,780
lot of the want to say that really need

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,059
one sex to design an accident plugin so

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,720
that women go sleep it will pop up when

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,870
we like hey before you go go go after

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,870
this

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:12,580
I love this question no I don't like you

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:14,409
I did it between I agree between 500 and

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,869
1500 words I know about a thousand now

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:20,169
with people changed only recently about

00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:21,249
a thousand I've heard it's better I put

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,659
in folks that have been twenty five

00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:25,389
hundred words and I've written posts

00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:27,399
though to think backwards you don't want

00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,899
to be you want to be white props and you

00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:49,570
don't want to have stuff in an elite

00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:50,379
unit that's the question that I don't

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,450
know the answers to

00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53,950
I do have recommendations affinity

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,739
nipple wrestling but I don't know how

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,679
Google reads but like I said man is my

00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:03,609
technical SEO expert I know about

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,429
writing but putting an infographic

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:08,769
injury I know that new place people will

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:11,019
interact about more and I think that if

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:13,210
you do it in a PDF format and it is

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:15,940
readable you can restore read context on

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,279
there and if it's already done but most

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,139
likely dramatic image so about all those

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,849
happy will stay on my page water which

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,849
will help with this

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:42,890
everywhere guys need not necessarily

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,169
alter it at the same content just alter

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,030
your message though people on Facebook

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,380
like stories they like they can interact

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,240
with and share with their friends

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,820
people on Twitter open it quick that

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,140
they can comment on click on and scroll

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,059
past

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,040
LinkedIn is great for business stuff

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:00,250
because people do actually read articles

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,020
on there

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,830
other than that always have it on your

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,320
site because you want to own your

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:12,820
content for sure originate your compound

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,820
shape and then post it oh sorry sorry

you're never not going to feel like that

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:38,920
just so you know you're not really here

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,360
you're going but I went using slack

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,540
telling us of themselves a reminder and

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,780
then we also with Co schedule if you

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,460
have a team planner that makes us a

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,100
growth plan is when you can start

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,480
letting more than one user and you can

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,590
assign Google Tasks when they have due

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,540
dates and things like that so it'll

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,710
remind them and maybe not so you don't

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,309
want to be lining up writing an

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,059
