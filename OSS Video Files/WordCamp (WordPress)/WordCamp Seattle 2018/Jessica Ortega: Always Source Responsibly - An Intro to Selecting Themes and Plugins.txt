Publication date: 2020-04-11
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Sourcing responsibly is crucial to the security, efficiency, and success of any WordPress site. Faced with millions of open source plugins and themes on the repository, how do you evaluate the add-ons you use to enhance your website? This introductory talk will go over best practices for ensuring you select the best and most necessary plugins for your website needs. I will also cover security basics, such as how to update your plugins and themes to ensure they donâ€™t leave vulnerabilities on your website that could lead to being hacked.

the first time I've ever done this have

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,250
never spoken in a work camp before I've

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,830
never done and a security talk before so

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,570
bear with me I also want to kind of

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,150
preempt everybody with and really about

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,530
a PowerPoint I'm practicing so you know

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,140
keep that in mind as I go through my

00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,519
slides she covered most of what we're

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,750
going to go over and I do want to give

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,490
you a quick agenda of what we're

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,869
covering today first of all I'm going to

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,090
give you a quick introduction to who I

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,970
am and why you should care about

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,130
anything I have to say I'm gonna give

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,200
you some basics on what themes and

00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,670
plugins are we're really pleased over

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,230
because there's a pretty good shot that

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,110
everybody in the room to use the FIFA

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,500
plug-in before I'm going to throw some

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,570
pretty scary numbers at you and then I'm

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,790
going to go over how to get around those

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,760
scary statistics by selecting things

00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,540
that work a quick guide to selecting

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,220
plugins that work and are secure how to

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,900
stay on top of lefty it's four themes

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,580
and plugins which is really important to

00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,640
WordPress security as website security

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,380
in general some general security tips

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
for keeping your WordPress site secure

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,400
and safe but conclusion and then I will

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,530
answer any questions that you guys have

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,390
so first of all Who am I again she says

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,680
my name is Jessica Ortega Phoenix

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,170
Arizona I am here with psycho calm I'm a

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
web security research analyst and

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,130
business analyst first I love my job

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,370
basically is to study number of trends

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,320
and vulnerability trends I am a

00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,240
co-founder and focus to the security

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,970
podcast decoding the security which

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,650
takes big security topics and makes it

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,970
more digestible for the small business

00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,229
owner or average Joe

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,970
and besides website security I am really

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,860
involved with Dog Rescue League

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,290
helped over sixty dogs finder for our

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,860
homes this year and I love the heavy

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,990
metal this is a very cute dog her name

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,910
is Francesca she is wine one of my

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,490
rescues and she is more interesting than

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,410
anything I have to say today so let's

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,000
start with a warm fuzzy feeling before I

00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,660
get into they're really scary security

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,760
stuff so some basics what are themes and

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,650
plugins everybody her in here is

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,140
probably use a theme or plugin at one

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,120
time or another basically where recipes

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,340
are your template they're your front end

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
they're what powers with the way their

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,750
WordPress site looks they're you know in

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,170
the old days they would have been a

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,360
thousand HTML files that tell your site

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,540
what to look like in individual pages

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,730
now they're primarily CSS and PHP there

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,030
are some JavaScript elements and other

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,500
languages that you can build themes in

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,170
WordPress plugins are a software that

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,160
can enhance or expand the functionality

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,250
of your website

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,310
some examples of WordPress plugins would

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,519
be things like contact form search

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,900
engine optimization plugins social media

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,180
buttons photo galleries there's over

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,980
56,000 plugins available for free in the

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,730
WordPress repository which is pretty

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,950
impressive

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,560
because look at me is that all of this

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,810
is open source and theoretically anyone

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,709
can build a theme or plugin just like

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,570
the WordPress core is open source so

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,010
some scary statistics the first one that

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,709
I want to provide you is that the

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,980
average website is attack approximately

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,480
58 times per day now what that means is

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,220
that it's not successful attacks

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,250
obviously your websites are not getting

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,320
hacked 58 times per day that would be

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,480
both excruciating and a little bit of

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,910
certain rate but that means though is

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,489
that there are automated intact BOTS or

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,760
hackers using scripts out there that are

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,980
trying to intern us here

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,200
site about 58 times per day or

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,750
approximately once every 30 minutes

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,209
which is pretty scary to think about and

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,720
it only takes one successful attack

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,579
account of one intruder or script or bot

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,940
that can get into your websites your

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:04,849
week absolute havoc and when I say havoc

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,370
I mean blacklisting on the search engine

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,720
as your site could go down WordPress we

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,599
could be talking the white screen of

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,280
death they can completely hijack your

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,530
website they can inject their own

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,799
contents into your web site drive

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,930
traffic to their websites that's where

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,389
you see things like pharmaceutical spam

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,880
escort service spam we've seen things

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:29,060
that say live all the way up to and

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,930
including car car dealerships who are

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,699
trying to sell things alone four

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,280
different pyramid schemes real estate

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,470
spam all the back over take your website

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,240
and completely destroy your your

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,440
reputation on the search engines so

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,080
that's something to keep in mind I know

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,470
it sounds really scary well we'll talk

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,860
about ways to get around it after this a

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,810
few more scary statistics we're correct

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,990
about one percent of WordPress sites

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,849
that were studied in q2 of 2018 have an

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,110
hour on them what this means is that if

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,570
you think about the total number of

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,910
WordPress sites out there approximately

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,310
five point eight million WordPress sites

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,949
globally could be infected with malware

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,470
at any given moment in time that's a

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,110
pretty scary high number

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,950
we found that WordPress sites on average

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,110
were about two

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,150
times more likely to be compromised and

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,360
websites that were built without a CMS

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,610
or that were built with a custom non

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,470
open-source Santa so the reason for that

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,780
largely is because of a process that we

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,460
call responsible disclosure what that

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,320
means is that any time our security

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,660
researcher like myself or like the guys

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,600
over the fence or security find a

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,910
vulnerability inside a plug-in or inside

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,060
the WordPress core or instead of theme

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,550
they notify the developers of that theme

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,830
or plugin or CMS and give them an

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,080
opportunity to patch to release a new

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,980
version that addresses the vulnerability

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,590
before before they actually disclose or

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,150
publish that vulnerability what that

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,490
means is that once the patch is out a

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,190
new version is updated they do publish

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,620
and publicly announce hey we found this

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,720
vulnerability attackers could get into

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,360
your site through a pc vector that's

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,370
usually something like crust X scripting

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,270
or sequel injection where they can

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:20,360
actually get into your database and then

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,030
script kiddies or amateur hackers will

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,440
actually go in and build tools to

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,270
automatically scan for that

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,370
vulnerability what that means is that

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,950
sites who don't go in an update right

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,100
away are now vulnerable to a security

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,470
issue that's published that anybody can

00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,300
build a box to attack and so what

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,220
they'll do if these attackers will build

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,620
these BOTS that scan millions of

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,380
websites every day looking for this one

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,140
known vulnerability and if they find it

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,090
they will immediately attack it they'll

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,530
exploit it given your website and

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,660
they'll upload whatever malicious

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,030
content Sleeper they happen to be into

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,520
whether that's phishing or back to work

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,229
files - or the aforementioned us

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,030
so that's something to be aware of and

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,979
we think that's probably got a lot to do

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,199
with why we WordPress and other

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,659
open-source applications tend to be more

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,080
vulnerable or infected with malicious

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:14,990
content in higher numbers what we found

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,819
was that 55% of the WordPress sites that

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,099
were infected with malware were running

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,110
the latest core versions that means that

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,060
even if you're viewing automatic updates

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,879
even if you're on managed wordpress

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,819
platforms with your hosting provider

00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:31,759
even if you've got every security model

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,250
in place for the core you can still be

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,219
infected with malware if you have a weak

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,520
password or if you have a theme or

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:43,009
plugin that's not up-to-date we've found

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,099
that 24 percent of WordPress sites have

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,300
a vulnerability and 16 percent of

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,449
WordPress sites have those

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,370
vulnerabilities and malware so if you're

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,719
not running the latest version or you're

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,569
not running your latest plug-in updates

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,879
you're infinitely more likely to be

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,960
infected with malicious content than you

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,120
would be if you work when we studied

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,460
approximately 1.5 million sites that

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,889
were running WordPress in q2 we found

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,629
that 6% of those sites were more like

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,639
more than likely infected through a

00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,889
vulnerable theme and plugin what that

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,509
means is that they have a loner ability

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:21,710
on their website but they were running

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:24,469
the latest core urgent of WordPress of

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,539
the wordpress course so they had a theme

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:28,550
on plug-in that was likely not

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,529
up-to-date or not being updated by the

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,570
developers it was code that nobody cared

00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,459
about and had a security vulnerability

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,940
that allowed an attacker to get into

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:39,800
WordPress so those are some pretty scary

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,709
stats I know it makes it sound like

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,959
WordPress is super vulnerable like it's

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,279
not a useful platform now they can be

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
for

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,749
from the truth the fact about is that we

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,569
know now that one in three sites online

00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:54,610
use wordpress so it's a huge platform

00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:57,249
it's the largest open source CMS

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,470
platform in the world which makes it a

00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,660
big target it doesn't mean that it's

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,329
inherently insecure it doesn't mean that

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,860
it isn't worth using it just means that

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,870
there are people out there who want to

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,589
attack it and you have to keep security

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,499
in mind so how do you select the right

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:16,360
theme obviously everybody is everybody

00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:17,559
excited is going to be different and the

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,809
first thing that you're thinking about

00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,819
when you think about a theme is how is

00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,370
it going to look how is it going to work

00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:27,069
is it going to do everything that I want

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,829
my site to do functionality wise that's

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:33,850
a great first step your second question

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:36,360
should be is it safe isn't secure so if

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,529
you tips for selecting a secure theme

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,240
first of all you if you're going to use

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,879
a free theme which is great they're

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,199
super customizable always choose your

00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,720
free themes from the WordPress

00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:50,379
repository that's wordpress.org slash

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,939
themes or from reg limit your WP admin

00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:53,829
which is what this screenshot is if you

00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,870
click Add theme and inside of your

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:59,470
WordPress dashboard it goes directly to

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,029
the WordPress repository so the reason

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,709
that we recommend using the WordPress

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,019
repository is that there's actually a

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,120
team of volunteers who monitor that

00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,850
repository for security issues and

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,759
updates if same security researcher

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,430
reports an up DARAB vulnerability inside

00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,230
of a theme to the WordPress themes team

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,629
to those volunteers they'll actually

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,110
remove it from the repository until that

00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,910
theme has been patched and updated so

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,569
generally speaking the repository is the

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,000
safest place to get a theme or plugin

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,520
you can pay for themes the issue with

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,590
pain

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,750
themes and plugins is that unlike the

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,090
WordPress repository where anybody can

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,430
download a zip file and run it through a

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,290
code scanner or review the files

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,140
themselves for vulnerabilities or

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,000
anomalies with a pain theme you have to

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,740
buy the product before you can actually

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,470
look at any of the codebase

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,240
so it can be kind of a mixed bag but

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,760
it's not to say that pain themes are not

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,740
good it's just to say you can't look at

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,230
them before you download them and pay

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,150
for them so if you're going to use a

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,280
pain theme or you want to use a paid

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,050
theme make sure you're actually paying

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,270
for it I know I feel like that should go

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,680
without saying but let's face it we live

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:14,630
in the era of pirating and streaming and

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,800
free unlocked versions of everything

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,960
right that's a trip more often than not

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,700
when you see a premium theme being

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,940
offered for free and it's not being

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,240
offered as a trial or freemium from the

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,360
actual developers you're seeing it on

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,980
Santorin site or free download site it

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,160
means that there's been malware infected

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,080
with it preemptively so attackers will

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,110
actually download these themes they'll

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,060
pay for one copy they'll make a million

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,250
copies of it and make that available to

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,260
you but before they do that they'll

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,510
actually insert your own malware or

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,130
their own backdoor files so once it's

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,850
been uploaded and installed on your

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,470
website they have remote access

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,070
everything in your code so that can be

00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,510
pretty

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,600
Duras and it's something that a lot of

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,890
people aren't really aware of when

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,420
you're looking at themes inside of the

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,760
repository you want to look for things

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,840
like when they were last updated

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,670
generally speaking you want to look for

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,650
an updated date within the last three to

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,140
six months what that tells you is that

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,000
the developers will care about that feet

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,920
are still reviewing the code are still

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,370
monitoring it and they're still thinking

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,350
updates you want to check on with your

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,780
developers so inside of the repository

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,490
will actually have the name of the

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,980
developer or the development team for

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,420
every plug-in and PM you can generally

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,360
click on that and go look at their

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,330
website do that make sure that their

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,610
website is secure they're using SSL they

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,980
have good reviews things like that and

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,870
then do a google search of that

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,530
development team and you can use things

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,080
like theme name broken female honorable

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,940
theme name hacked those are all keywords

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,710
that you can use in a quick google

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,440
search to tell you whether or not other

00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:01,700
users of these themes have actually had

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,590
issues with them and then scan that

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,300
theme code for vulnerabilities like I

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,830
said anybody can go to the WordPress

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,500
repository and the through your

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,940
dashboard or through WordPress tower and

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,520
actually download the zip file

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,800
associated with everything you can then

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,570
either open it up on your own or pyramid

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,850
with code or you're relatively familiar

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,180
with it and look for anomalies in the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,920
code using a text editor anomalies in

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,950
the code would be things that are exist

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:32,360
stay outside of your opening and closing

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:35,240
PHP tags or things that seem to run off

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,860
the page if everything looks relatively

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,440
uniform everything is really well

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,740
notated and then all of a sudden you

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,350
have to scroll way way away

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,990
way way down or way way way up and

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,360
there's random a few scattered or

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,280
randomly generated code on in any of

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,410
those places a lot of times that's a

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,930
symptom of malware most fema plugin

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,280
developers will keep really good notes

00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,870
they'll make everything look really nice

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,490
and uniform because they know their code

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,560
is publicly available and they want to

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,600
have a good impression so looking for

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,890
anomaly it's like that even if you don't

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,080
understand what they're doing because

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,930
you're not a malware researcher or

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,900
reverse engineering code it's a good tip

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,730
that hey this might be a red flag maybe

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,270
I should run it through a vulnerability

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,100
scanner or a quote risk scanner or just

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,270
an antivirus scanner if you happen to

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,980
have one on your computer you can

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,140
download that set file and run it

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,810
through and I'll tell you okay there's

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:33,730
no malware there's no viruses inside of

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:35,670
this code so picking your plugins a lot

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,140
of this advice has been astound

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,960
repetitive because a lot of it is the

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,780
same across themes and plugins

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,580
however with plugins is arguably more

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,710
important so if you pay attention to

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,420
nothing else that I'm saying pay

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:53,740
attention to picking your plugins

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:56,470
because plugins have the power to do a

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,570
lot of good but with that we have a

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,510
power power to do a lot of damage as

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,060
well plugins often and access the actual

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,950
code for your WordPress site they change

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,200
the functionality both on the front end

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,180
and the back end they gather information

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,830
and they store information in your

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,670
database they're critical to the way

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,650
WordPress functions and because of that

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,630
there's a lot of room for malicious

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,200
actors there's a lot of room for bad to

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,630
happen

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,790
so again if you're going to stop plugins

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,410
from for free make sure you're doing it

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,709
from

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,050
repository fest wordpress.org / plugins

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,329
much like the themes there is a plugin

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,029
team it's a team completely comprised of

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,069
volunteers who will actually go and

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,990
remove report and plug-in is from

00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:43,649
reported vulnerable plugins from the

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,449
repository to ensure that nobody else is

00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,339
downloading that former a little code or

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,250
if malware is found in a plugin although

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,100
I never remove it from the repository

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,949
just last week there was a pretty big

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,500
plugin WP gdpr which was used for gdpr

00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:01,550
compliance for the European Union had

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,019
over 300,000 active installations and a

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,360
security researcher found a critical

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,709
security vulnerability in it within a

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,629
couple of hours of reporting that

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,430
vulnerability to the WordPress book and

00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:13,560
his team it was removed from a

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,600
repository and it was kept up the

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,750
repository for about 24 hours while the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,550
team patched that vulnerability so keep

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,040
in mind that again the repository is

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,500
generally pretty safe because there is a

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,220
team of people who actively modern and

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,980
manage that and again along the same

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:35,069
lenses themes chat October 10 reviews

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,589
and active installs generally speaking

00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:41,130
if a wordpress plugin has a lot of

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:43,920
active installations it's probably safe

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,500
if it's being frequently updated it's

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,930
probably safe even if there have been

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,279
security issues with a plugin there have

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,110
been a lot of security issues with

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,689
really popular plugins things like

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,360
contact form 7 which is one of the most

00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,370
popular contact form plugins that's have

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,100
reported security issues but because

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,870
it's got an active development based you

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,039
don't have to worry about that so long

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,980
as you're running the most up-to-date

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,500
version and there's nothing inherently

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,510
wrong with having somebody report a

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,760
mistake or a vulnerability in a plugin

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,729
so long as that team of developers is

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,559
patching apple

00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:22,049
so again review your developers look at

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,059
who's making these plugins I don't know

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,399
if anybody got to catch Kathy's amp from

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,590
WordPress yesterday gave a speech about

00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:30,570
evaluating the security of plugins as

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,299
well as she talked about what happens

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,190
when plugins change hands sometimes the

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,899
development team will change and you can

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,269
go into the plug-in the per depositor II

00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:40,710
and see a complete history of every

00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,349
change that's ever occurred on the

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,229
plug-in and if it changes development

00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:48,119
hands make sure that it's still being

00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:50,099
actively developed make sure that

00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,799
somebody is still actively updating and

00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,249
managing that because it could be a very

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,409
popular plug-in that gets sold and

00:17:55,249 --> 00:18:00,570
changes developers hands and the new

00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:03,570
developer is now in started malware into

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,059
it or they're no longer paying attention

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:09,119
to it so keep an eye on the history of

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:11,580
those plugins that you're using and

00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,710
again do Google search search for

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,129
problems things like plug-in named

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,719
broken plug-in name chapped is probably

00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,629
one of my favorites because it usually

00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:23,129
will tell you whether or not issues have

00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:25,019
popped up you can also check the

00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:27,690
wordpress.org forums one of the best

00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,190
things about WordPress is the community

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,049
and I mean that's that's what brought us

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,299
all here today right is the WordPress

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,129
community talking about it getting out

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,169
there and engaging people who work with

00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:39,269
WordPress use that to your advantage

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:43,049
when you're selecting their themes and

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,879
plugins and search for scandal for known

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,649
vulnerabilities again just like themes

00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:47,300
you can download that zip file and you

00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:49,550
can review

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,620
put yourself in a text editor you can

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,330
run it through a malware scanner there

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,190
are plugins that you can use that will

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,170
actually scan it for vulnerabilities

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,300
there are a lot of different companies

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,430
out there who offer code scanning and

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,870
vulnerability scanning and generally

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,480
they'll tell you whether or not hey this

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:08,860
is something that we know is insecure

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,420
this could lead to your singing hat and

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,180
really really important install the

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,400
updates as soon as they're available

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,560
unfortunately unlike the WordPress core

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,920
there aren't a whole lot of themes and

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,650
plugins that have active automatic

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,300
updating so you have to check for the

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,740
updates on your themes and plugins and

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,810
you have to update them as soon as

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,890
possible now there's a couple of

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,670
different ways that you can make

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,260
yourself get yourself get alerted to you

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,960
have themes that have been released for

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,660
themes and plugins with plugins you can

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,970
go to the WP lone DP which is the

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,610
WordPress vulnerability database they

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,170
have both an RSS feed and a mailing list

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,270
that you can get on so that they'll

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,640
actually send you an email alert or an

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,440
RSS alert as soon as a plugins been

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,290
updated or as soon as vulnerability has

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,060
been identified so you know hey I have

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,950
to log in tomorrow and update WordPress

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,340
or I have to log in this afternoon or

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,470
not date this plug-in so let's talk

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,900
about that dates a little bit this is in

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,610
case you've never seen it and I hope you

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,520
have appeared in WordPress

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:16,220
this is the WordPress update page it's

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,650
really tempting to go in here when there

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,340
are updates and hit select all and

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,500
update ball that's great if your site

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,770
isn't critical to your business or if

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,240
they're minor updates how about it if

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,420
your site is critical to your business

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,240
or you your major version updates or

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,490
it's an older plugin that hasn't

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
dated in a long time I think these

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,900
things one by one because if something

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,480
breaks you're going to want to know

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,690
which one of these items caused your

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,090
site to break even better if you can and

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,920
ensure your business website use the

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,870
staging environment my colleague Jamie

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,360
just had to talk couple hours ago about

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,280
using a staging environment for your

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,740
site to make sure that when you do these

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,380
new plugin installations new theme

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,810
installations or updates that you're

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,790
catching any errors or issues before

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:11,470
that happens before they break your site

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,450
and take it down so all of these plugins

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,400
and themes should be getting fairly

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,830
regular updates if it's something that's

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,980
relatively static one or two updates

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,380
that addresses a security issue or above

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,830
fix every six months or so it's usually

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,210
okay if it's something more dynamic or

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,600
more critically you want to see things

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,670
every couple of months at least updates

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,390
can be done from your WP admin dashboard

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:40,690
I recommend checking monthly so at least

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,760
once a month if not more often log in to

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,080
your WordPress dashboard and hit updates

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,300
and make sure that everything you're

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,590
running the subsidy that'll keep it so

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,000
that you're safe see if you're safe

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,120
secure and it doesn't how many

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,560
vulnerabilities and once you've

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,390
completed your updates you want to go

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,490
ahead and clear any cache that you have

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,720
and make sure your say it's still

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,260
running the way that you wanted it to

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,390
look for things like new content that

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,460
wasn't there before that could be

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,890
injected malware rejected spam that's

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,560
coming from a plugin that's recently

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,420
changed hands the guys over at WordPress

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,700
tell a story about a guy named me since

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,100
Ouisa who was found to have actually

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,530
purchased several plugins and used them

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,190
to insert malware into dozens and

00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,320
hundreds in some key

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,720
sites so that's something that you

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,360
should always look for again if you can

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,700
a staging environment is really good for

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,440
this kind of thing the best double-edged

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,549
sword though and you want to keep in

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,610
mind that if you have a staging

00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,289
environment especially if it's say a sub

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,539
domain or a subfolder on your own

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:45,169
hosting encounter your own server links

00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:47,360
staging sites comm you have to promote

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,950
updates on your staging environment and

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,350
treat with your staging environment with

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,690
all of the good care and love that you

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,539
put your production site because if it's

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,860
on the same server and you leave

00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,600
something well remote or you do

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,070
something not even on your staging

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,529
excited that is that the amount of your

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,389
production same hackers can still get in

00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:07,490
through a staging site even thinking

00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,350
more often than not traverse directories

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,179
and getting your production site as well

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:15,919
we see that all the time inside Bach and

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,019
one last note when you're doing your

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,909
inventory of your plugins you're doing

00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,980
your monthly checkup make sure that

00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:24,139
you're removing anything that you're not

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,269
using and when I say we're moving and

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:28,580
don't mean deactivating that's a common

00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,919
misconception the aggravating themes and

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,080
plugins is not enough to remove all

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,419
neural code from your website it leaves

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,450
it very accessible for any attacker to

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:40,940
see so if you're not using something

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,639
make sure you go in and post deactivate

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,429
and delete it there are also plugins

00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:48,019
available that will do things like

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:50,570
optimize your database tables remove

00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:53,120
duplicate posts and folders WP optimize

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,769
this great forgot and relax you to clean

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,509
up the remnants of anything that is

00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:58,990
deleted plug-in leaves behind so that's

00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:02,149
something to keep in mind as well

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:05,240
so file updates most of us use our

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:07,490
managed WordPress sites or we have

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,669
automatic updating on our core enable

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,180
already that's a great first step if

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:14,770
you're if you feel confident with your

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,390
in your plugins and I really don't

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,180
recommend this but I want to include it

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,550
anyway because it is an option you can't

00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,980
actually set themes and plugins to

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,960
automatically update by including these

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,930
two lines of code on your themes

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,360
functions.php file so you can go and add

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,430
this to your functions.php file if you

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,290
feel comfortable doing that and will

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:38,260
actually update all of your themes and

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,850
plugins automatically for you but again

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,820
the reason that I don't recommend doing

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:46,180
this for a production website is because

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,970
if a theme or plugin is updated and it

00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,110
breaks your site it breaks your site and

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,090
if you're not paying close attention

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,160
when those updates occur things like

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,930
maybe overnight or late or early in the

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,900
morning when you're when you're asleep

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,670
you may not know how long your site's

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,620
been down you can get away screen of

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,270
death because something Auto updated

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,760
that wasn't compatible with something

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,320
else on your site but you'll have no way

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,650
of tracking that down and they'll have

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,010
no logs to tell you what broke your

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:17,260
website so if it's a relatively minor

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,060
site if it's your personal blog and you

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,410
don't care about downtime on it it's not

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,930
gaining you know it's not making you any

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,760
money here's a quick and dirty kind of

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,620
solution to having to log in all the

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,730
time and check for updates but it's

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,110
something that you really want to be

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:35,500
careful using all right a few general

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:38,590
WordPress security tips and again really

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,720
quickly I know this slide is hard to see

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,330
it will be available on the website if

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,490
it's not already this is my first

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,590
presentation and I didn't think to bring

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,010
up this laundry list of homework that

00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,870
I'm giving you guys so my apologies but

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,750
just really quickly we're going to run

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:58,240
through some quick and dirty WordPress

00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:01,090
security tips things like changing your

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,559
admin URL so what that is is your domain

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:07,440
comm slash WP

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,169
leaving that accessible allows anybody

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,019
who's looking at your website to try and

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,539
see if you're running WordPress so

00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,389
rather than changing that to something

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,090
else whether that's your domain /

00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:23,789
administrator your domain / dashboard

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,399
your domain / your dog's name whatever

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,380
you want it to be to hide that it gives

00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,419
attackers one less thing that they can

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,429
look for on your public facing website

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,559
and there are plugins city that there's

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,769
ways that you can do custom code inside

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:43,830
of your settings but I personally use a

00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:46,490
plug-in because it's easier I use I

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,200
think it's called WP change admin

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,880
there's a ton out there if you want to

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,820
find me afterwards I'll give you a

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,620
couple of lists of specific plugins that

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,779
I'm using and we have to look inside of

00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,760
my my dashboard if I'm being totally

00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,919
honest with you

00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,380
I also recommend using a Web Application

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,549
Firewall this is a paid option and it's

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,880
not something that every small business

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:10,769
is ready for but a firewall will

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,720
actually do a lot of these things for

00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:15,360
you but a limit brute-force attacks it

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,370
will filter out bot traffic it stops

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,250
specific kinds of attacks for example

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,779
uploads cross-site scripting the sequel

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,639
injection a lot of firewalls will

00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:26,340
actually block that type of traffic

00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:28,740
before it ever accesses your site so

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,960
that's a great proactive solution to

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,299
keep your website online and a lot of

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,970
them come with CDN it's like CloudFlare

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,409
that speed up your website - so if

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,730
that's something that you're concerned

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,470
about performance is something that

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,419
you're concerned about or you just want

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,879
to limit the amount

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,729
with the Boxster using a firewall is a

00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:47,779
great way to do it use two-factor

00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:50,029
authentication

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,159
there's a couple of editors out here who

00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,700
are offering some really cool two-factor

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,070
authentication options through plugins

00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:01,309
use two-factor authentication passwords

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,099
are not strong and enough anymore

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:06,709
whether you use SMS authentication

00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:09,019
whether you use an app whether you use a

00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:11,659
physical token that's all up to you

00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:13,070
however you want to do it two-factor

00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:14,839
authentication is available for your

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,499
wordpress dashboard and you should be

00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,359
using it using numbers in turn so

00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:22,249
there's free options there's cloud

00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,279
options there's plugin options like

00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:28,429
wordfence there is you know physical

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,889
options like sidewalk like security

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:32,989
however you want to do it use a malware

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:35,450
scanner preferably one that runs at

00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:37,339
least a week that can automatically

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,799
remove or at least alert you to any

00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:42,229
malware that's found on your website you

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,070
know ideally we use all these things

00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:47,599
change the event you use a firewall you

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,579
use two-factor authentication

00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,190
actlly an attacker never gets into your

00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:54,709
website but it's better to plan for the

00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:04,009
worst than it is to clean up a mess

00:28:54,709 --> 00:29:07,519
afterwards I prefer daily weekly is okay

00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:10,519
if you're okay with your with malware

00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,200
not getting hot for seven days so keep

00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,899
in mind that one of the things about how

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,940
are especially late malware that changes

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:19,459
how your search engine optimization or

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,259
your search engine visibility works it

00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:22,999
could be sending traffic elsewhere

00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:26,179
redirects could be sending traffic from

00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:28,339
your site to other sites for days if

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,480
you're running weekly you could have a

00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:33,120
hacked by the Syrian army message

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,740
on your website for up to seven days you

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,500
know they get in within a few minutes

00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,320
after that your outer skin runs the same

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,090
is true of daily scans but typically it

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,790
takes the search engines and it takes

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,410
customers longer than a day to find that

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,540
there's a problem on your website

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,630
especially if you've got good caching so

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:54,830
I read the men's daily weekly is okay

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,830
it's better than not at all

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,190
so with malware scanner it's a lot of

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,530
them actually include vulnerability

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,510
scanners now as well so I also recommend

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,210
regularly scanning for vulnerabilities

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,280
now unlike malware vulnerabilities you

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,920
can scan or weekly or monthly for those

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,080
so you know if you don't want to pay for

00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,910
a daily phoner ability scanner you want

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,310
to use something free that you run once

00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,770
a month or once a week that's okay

00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,660
because chances are you're not going to

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,370
have a new vulnerability on your website

00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,770
every day as long as you're staying on

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:29,250
state with your updates

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:31,760
use strong passphrase so the most secure

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,010
password is the one you don't know if

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,470
you can I always recommend using a

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,420
password manager the only password that

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,370
you should ever really know is the one

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,340
that you use to get into your password

00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:47,640
lock box if you can't use a password

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:50,460
manager use password phrases so these

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,740
are things like entire sentences or

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,760
anagrams made from the first letter of

00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,860
each word entire sentence we're finding

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,230
more and more that password brute-force

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,090
programs are getting more sophisticated

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,060
it's getting easier and quicker to break

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,520
into passwords and are entirely too many

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,790
people still using password 1-2-3 is

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,260
their password please I'm not going to

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,230
judge you you don't have to raise your

00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,990
hand if you're in this room you're

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,620
listening to

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,020
security sauk and you know somewhere out

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,850
there you have an account using password

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:29,500
from password 1-2-3 or password one

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,580
exclamation point that doesn't make it

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,040
any more secure

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,890
promise me silently with your eyes

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,030
promise me you're going to leave this

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:42,850
room and change your password I will

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,350
give you some invitations to free VPNs I

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,420
will give you some recommendations so

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,970
you can sign it over your hotel Wi-Fi

00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,740
for the word camp Wi-Fi I don't care

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,929
get out of here and change your

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,540
passwords right away it's that critical

00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,970
you guys they've done studies that last

00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,030
year password was still the number one

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:08,290
most used password in the world stop it

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:10,030
I can't I can't I'm begging you that's a

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,890
wordpress that's that's of general

00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,530
security for everybody don't use fast

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:18,720
for this your password don't use PE @

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:23,260
sign ass word that is not anymore secure

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,550
it does not make you leave when you're

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,800
looking at your your WordPress database

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,870
another thing you can do to secure it is

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,820
to change that briefing so when

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,770
WordPress sets up by default it sets

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,570
your prefix on your tables to WP

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,850
underscore and then whatever the table

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,220
name is during setup you can actually

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,840
change that you can change it to random

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,730
letters and numbers you can change it I

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,340
think one of my sites is actually using

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,070
my dog's name so it's like lying on her

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,279
score WordPress tables so whatever you

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:53,039
want it to be that's one more thing

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,029
hackers can't guess automatically when

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,499
they're trying to get into your website

00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:00,419
limit login attempts and avoid

00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:02,940
brute-force attacks there's actually a

00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:06,169
plugin that Kathy talked about yesterday

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,940
called limit login attempts it has about

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,049
150,000 active installs it hasn't been

00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,379
updated in six years

00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:15,779
don't use that there's another one

00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:17,580
called I believe no brute force that's

00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,950
what I use it's got great reviews

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,599
it's regularly updated and what that

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,479
does is it locks your WordPress

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,849
dashboard down for 24 hours or until

00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:29,299
your reset password or 30 minutes

00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:31,469
depending on how you set it up once

00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:36,509
somebody's tried to log in to your

00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:38,669
dashboard say 5 or 10 times check file

00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:39,869
permissions and limit access so this is

00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:41,779
something that you can do when you're

00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:44,219
actually installing news plug-ins

00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:46,080
sometimes you'll see plug-ins kind of

00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:47,999
like apps for your phone and ask for

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,149
weird permissions they want to ask for

00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:53,669
access to things beyond the WP plugins

00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:55,979
and the wp-content folder that can be

00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:58,200
really dangerous sometimes they want to

00:33:55,979 --> 00:34:01,019
do things like change file permissions

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,659
to 777 or read/write/execute

00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,089
no plugin means seven seven seven

00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,909
permissions for anything just don't if

00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:11,369
they're asking you for that when you see

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,289
but if you see files on your your file

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,429
and during your hosting provider that

00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:20,309
have 777 or rewrite execute permissions

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,720
run uninstall that deleted leave a bad

00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:24,690
review run

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,059
what 777 or rewrite execute removes do

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:30,419
is they allow anybody to view or modify

00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:33,299
that file without authentication without

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:35,039
permission from you it's really

00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:37,079
dangerous it's a really great way for

00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,490
attackers to use scripts to insert

00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,069
malware inside otherwise legitimate

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,960
files so some when we see a lot of it

00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:45,990
that Sidewalk when we clean malware off

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,810
of science is legitimate for wordpress

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,820
files

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,620
have been a lot of five to seven seven

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:55,810
seven or 700 permissions and they have

00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,150
malware injected to the top of them they

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,790
have things like cryptocurrency mining

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,010
scripts they're hanging your visitors

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,690
resources your visitors computers when

00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,790
they read when they hit your site and

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,770
you don't know that because it's

00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,620
symptomless because nothing has caught

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,500
it so really watch your permissions guys

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,210
I know that this is kind of bordering on

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,830
intermediate to advanced and this is

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,300
supposed to be a beginner's top but

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,610
there's a lot of guides available both

00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,350
through wordpress.org and for your

00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,700
hosting provider more than likely I'm on

00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,530
how to go in and look at those file

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,210
permissions I encourage everybody to

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:34,060
learn a little bit about it it's not as

00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:35,710
complicated as it sounds so remove your

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,020
WordPress version number this is another

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,670
kind of more advanced tip there's a lot

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,410
of places inside that WordPress core

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,540
files where it lists what were press

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,730
version you're using the reason that you

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,640
want to remove that number is because

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,920
it's again one more thing that hackers

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,810
have public access to they'll tell them

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,190
whether or not your site is vulnerable a

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,280
couple of weeks we're going to have

00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,270
WordPress version 5 will come out and

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,810
everybody we're running WordPress

00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:03,580
version for point whatever is probably

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,630
going to be vulnerable to some kind of

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,430
security issue

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,860
it's going to be easier to break into a

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,290
wordpress 4 point whatever site then it

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:14,200
will be to break into WordPress 5.0 and

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:17,460
if they can find your WP dash admin page

00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:21,700
and it says running WordPress for 0.98

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:24,010
they know exactly what weak points to

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,830
hit without and we're looking at your

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,580
actual website I can keep accurate

00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,320
backups

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,690
something that we talked about on our

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,050
security podcast a lot is the rule of

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,690
three so if you have a site you should

00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,910
keep three copies of that site increment

00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,069
every time it changes you should keep

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,470
one on the same server rear sight is for

00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:47,440
an emergency you should keep one off

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:50,230
safe so in cloud storage like a Google

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,940
Drive or one driver you're out of flour

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,880
whatever flavor of cloud storage you

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,750
enjoy and one physical copy so whether

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,190
that's a DVD CD a thumb drive whatever I

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,020
had a copy of my first couple of

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,569
WordPress sites that lived on my iPod

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,250
I'm not even kidding it was just a place

00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,890
to keep it that I knew would be secure

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,839
so keep backups make sure your

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,990
increments I recommend backing up your

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:18,670
site at least weekly and every time you

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:21,099
do an update or make a change so in

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,980
conclusion I apologize if I have

00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:25,660
frightened you I promise you I love

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,430
WordPress and it's because I love

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,650
WordPress that I talk about all of the

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,500
scary things a moment WordPress makes

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,299
building a website really easy makes it

00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,220
accessible to everyone and lowers the

00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:41,109
bar of entry for building a website to

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,779
anybody literally anybody with a

00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,470
computer can build a WordPress site

00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:46,660
that's awesome

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,779
seriously I remember when we were using

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,549
geo cities and had bad mini files of

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:53,890
Metallica songs and that was how we got

00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:57,130
our websites off the ground and it was

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:59,799
still too complicated my mom could build

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:03,460
a wordpress site on our iPad with no

00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:05,440
skill but that's a double-edged sword

00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,289
any time that something is easy to

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,160
access for you for good it's equally

00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:15,430
easy at access for back so if you learn

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,940
nothing take away the day that you have

00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:22,029
to think about website security hacking

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,960
is becoming increasingly profitable it's

00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:28,539
easy its automated it doesn't require a

00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,099
whole lot of effort from criminals to

00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,279
and your website doesn't do things like

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:36,039
find for bitcoins or siphon your traffic

00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:37,890
to their pyramid scheme sites or our

00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:40,809
escort sites or whatever

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,859
so think about website security when

00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:45,429
you're putting your WordPress site

00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:49,029
together think about is this theme safe

00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:51,969
is this plugin safe if you can do that

00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:53,979
you oh you're already ahead of the curve

00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:57,039
you're already ahead of the average

00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:59,439
website owner and if you have the budget

00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:03,309
and your website is critical to your

00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:05,349
business invest in the security invest

00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:07,169
in a good firewall invest in a good

00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:09,549
malware scan for whether that's through

00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:11,349
silo or whether that's through another

00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:13,779
provider as long as you're thinking

00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,719
about it being proactive you're taking

00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:18,849
those steps you won't be in that one

00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,179
person you won't be in that six percent

00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,469
of honorable plug in minute they let

00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:25,599
somebody get into your website

00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:28,329
completely destroy it completely destroy

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,400
your livelihood let's go out every day

00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,249
and not be part of that five million

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:43,409
sites that has a vulnerability or that

00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:43,409
has malware so questions sure

00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:57,020
from inside the various places where it

00:39:49,460 --> 00:40:00,620
appears or is that there's probably a

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,790
plug-in before it so she's asking if

00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,220
there's a flooding that will help you go

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,140
in and remove the WordPress version so

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,870
to my knowledge there isn't but there

00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,390
may be however I know that there are

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,550
tutorials online that show you exactly

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,700
what files and where to edit and they're

00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,320
really easy to follow so you know that's

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,420
one of those things that if it takes two

00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,250
minutes to do with an online tutorial or

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,630
a YouTube video I recommend doing it

00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,690
that way instead of using a plug-in

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,360
because the less plugins you have the

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,040
smaller your attack service so if it

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,600
can't be done manually I recommend doing

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:50,660
it manually versus doing it with a

00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:52,940
plug-in this is my this is my first step

00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,119
my first cover prime security talk so

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,119
[Applause]

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,130
mostly the same repository such a

00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,539
trusted in the same way yeah so the

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,789
repository has a lot of what they call

00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:16,279
freemium and what that is is revealed No

00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:18,440
thank you young movie a trial version or

00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:19,880
a version that's kind of neutered a

00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,319
little bit doesn't have all the bells

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,630
and whistles and then they want you to

00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:26,479
have created a paid version those are

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,819
just as safe as the free plugins that

00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:30,559
give you full functionality they are

00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,239
asking you to pay basically so those

00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,089
developers can keep the lights on so I

00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,619
personally really like freemium because

00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:38,749
it gives you a way to you can interact

00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,759
with that development team and you

00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:42,380
paying them for something there's a

00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:43,819
pretty good shot that you're actually

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,890
they care about that code and they're

00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:47,569
going to keep it maintained so they are

00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,339
equally safe to the free plug-ins on the

00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:51,349
repository so long as you're getting

00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:53,299
them either from wordpress.org flash

00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:56,140
plugins or from the add new plug-in

00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:56,140
inside of your dashboard

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:04,279
sure yeah one thing as far as what they

00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:07,309
were talking about with yes one of

00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:10,279
juicing things I frequently worry

00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,259
I had the theme that I use which is

00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,219
mainly because it's the only theme for

00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:15,920
my needs

00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:18,289
it's very much a labor of love by one

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,529
guy while he'll give you all the support

00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:23,660
he can provide the only guy doing it but

00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:26,509
having said that I always get nervous

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,870
when on any theme or plugin that doesn't

00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:29,570
happen

00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:34,280
they say over six months is that a

00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:36,350
rational concern yes yeah yeah you know

00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,930
you can always reach out to that one guy

00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,400
and say hey I noticed you have enough

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,320
did with this plugin or this theme in

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,480
the last eight months or the last year

00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,760
however are you still maintaining it

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,410
have you received the reports and Google

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,140
you know do a little bit of research but

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,790
it could just literally be that they

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,580
haven't have an issue they haven't had

00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,480
above so you know I encourage

00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,250
communicating with developers get

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,810
involved in the community that's again

00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,730
that's why we're all here today is for

00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,460
the community and those open source

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,980
steps it is a labor of love and if they

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,520
can't believe a answer your question but

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,520
it absolutely is a rationale here

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
sure

00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:24,430
I would say yes if you can there are a

00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,499
couple of options there plus the amount

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,599
of plugins no longer developed you can

00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:30,279
either start researching and preparing

00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:32,049
to change back theme and I know it's

00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:34,779
themes it's a large undertaking because

00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:37,209
it could potentially mean completely

00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,769
changing the way your site functions or

00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:41,440
the way your site looks and I know that

00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:44,410
that's a huge labor but it's probably

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,479
still a good idea alternatively if you

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,219
really want to put the love into it you

00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:50,619
can learn how to keep that theme updated

00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:53,319
yourself that's a pretty advanced

00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,119
undertaking as well so you know

00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:58,450
unfortunately there's no easy answer to

00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,009
that question the TLDR of it is yeah if

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,630
they're not developing her they're not

00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:05,069
supporting that beam anymore it's

00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,069
probably time to find anyone

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,930
I got a lot of good themes in the

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,510
repository it's hard to give specific

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,040
recommendations for themes because it's

00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,720
going to be different depending on what

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,000
you do with your website I use one

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,700
called WP spot for my small business

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,320
site and I love it and I've never had an

00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,690
issue with it and it gets regular

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:49,020
updates but that may not work if you're

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:50,970
not running a daycare so I'm not working

00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,830
who harness enough to give a good

00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,800
recommendation one way or the other I

00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,200
would say just you know do your research

00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,700
look at the reviews and reviews are kind

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,520
of a double-edged sword right because

00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:06,180
you can buy good reviews so it may not

00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,010
be great or one crazy guy who couldn't

00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,350
get in a scheme to do what you wanted it

00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:13,320
we will want to start on our reason so

00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:15,900
really dig in and if you have to email

00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,070
interview those developers and ask any

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:28,380
questions that you might have about

00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:30,150
their theme behind you so you would

00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,700
actually have to go in and edit PHP

00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,470
files that have that version number in

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,000
it like I said there's a lot of YouTube

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,800
tutorials out that you can actually

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,780
follow it takes about five minutes to

00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,120
remove it from our site if you're good

00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,120
with the text editor not to be yep

00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:52,640
the question about the e-commerce if the

00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:16,940
storefront is like the theme that seems

00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:19,160
automatic but their official theme is so

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,779
I would start with tutorials for your

00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,700
hosting provider on how to get into your

00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:25,579
file manager or how to connect to your

00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,400
site through FTP most WordPress sites

00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,589
run on a Linux environment so you can go

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,019
in for FTP or File Manager and really

00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:35,510
quickly to see list of all the

00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:39,410
permissions the big red flag that you

00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:41,510
want to look for is 7 7 7 so lucky 7 7 7

00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,299
your target about Linux is actually

00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,740
unlucky 7 7 7 so that's a really easy

00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:52,069
way to remember it that's all you're

00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:54,450
looking for anybody else

00:46:52,069 --> 00:47:06,150
sure

00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:13,589
ah it's the WP Boland DB or double use

00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:16,920
WordPress vulnerability database WP vuln

00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:23,640
the B or w wordpress vulnerability

00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:25,920
database it is o @ WP boom DVD org or if

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:38,040
you just google wordpress vulnerability

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:48,660
database it's the first result watching

00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:50,010
if it's when it's free yeah and paid for

00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,460
themes and plugins is a double-edged

00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:54,990
sword too because just because you know

00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,720
that they have developers that are

00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,940
managing it it doesn't look very good or

00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,849
that they're aware of vulnerabilities

00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,140
because unlike free plugins are open

00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:06,569
source plugins and themes

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,150
nobody can download that content and

00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:11,910
research it without paying for it so

00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:14,490
they might have an in-house dev that

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:16,619
manages that but that MN on step isn't

00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:20,250
necessarily a vulnerability researcher

00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:21,390
so it's it could go both ways I always

00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,490
encourage if you're thinking about

00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,020
paying for a plug-in our theme really

00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,589
get to know the company that you're

00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:31,650
paying for and ask them hey you have a

00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:33,059
bug bounty program or a vulnerability

00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,339
program that will be

00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:39,269
you're coding and scans your code for

00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:59,579
vulnerabilities okay we've got one more

00:48:39,269 --> 00:49:01,949
question so it's hard for us to tell

00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,469
because we can't get updated themes and

00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:08,189
plugins because there are so many but

00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:10,829
for people who have almost no plugins so

00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:15,119
one of my plugins and wonderful themes

00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:17,519
and or updates the the incidents of

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,709
hacked sites or incident the malware

00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,869
infection is about half of what it is

00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:24,419
for the rest of the population so where

00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:26,519
we see 1% infection rate work for

00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:28,409
everybody else as an average for those

00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,390
who are running one to five plugins and

00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:35,089
keep their porn updated we see it at

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:40,049
about 0.45 percent and of site web.com

00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:41,429
slash website security insider or just

00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:43,049
go to our second big banner on the

00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:45,709
bottom of it you can actually read that

00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,709
full report

00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,260
[Applause]
