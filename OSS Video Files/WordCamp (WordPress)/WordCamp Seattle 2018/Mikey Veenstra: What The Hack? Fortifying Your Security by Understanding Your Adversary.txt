Title: Mikey Veenstra: What The Hack? Fortifying Your Security by Understanding Your Adversary
Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Malicious activity is an unfortunate reality when maintaining a web presence today. Most people involved in the web industry know someone who encountered the aftermath of a disruptive attack–if they haven’t themselves. Because of this, awareness of security best practices is at an all-time high. To many, though, it may not be clear exactly why these measures are important.
To remedy that, we’ll be taking a practical look at what’s actually happening when a website gets attacked, as well as discussing the hows and whys along the way. From understanding why small sites still get hacked, to why password reuse is really as bad as everyone says, we’ll explore the rationale behind the security principles you’re always being told to follow.

	00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,040
to introduce my future

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,830
what the hack porta fighting your

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,430
security by understanding your adversary

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,720
my concern is an analyst at work cuts he

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,980
believes that the best way to understand

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,270
something is to try and teach it to

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,090
someone who believes that never

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,820
understand it themselves the Internet is

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,590
a pinnacle of human collaboration at the

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,770
same time can seem prohibitively

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,170
difficult to make proper use of for the

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,940
layperson I may contribute concepts and

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,309
digestible and accessible as possible

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,809
we stand to greatly improve the

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,909
experience not only for the

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:58,319
organization's building presence but for

00:00:38,909 --> 00:01:00,539
the future users as well this is what

00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:01,640
the heck or define your security by

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,030
understanding

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,490
theory here in the next hour or so we're

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,440
going to be talking about how websites

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,020
get hacked and how organization from

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,409
South connect from the perspective of

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,119
the people doing it and by understanding

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,280
then you're going to be in a much better

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,110
position to defend against it rather

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:28,220
than trying to defend against some

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:29,570
nebulous concept of you know the trying

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,430
to defend against the nebulas hacker

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,520
that you know just has these seemingly

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:42,110
magical policies pretty impossible so if

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:44,479
we can make that part let's invade so my

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,100
name is Mikey I have a threat analyst at

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,530
defiance here the company that makes

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,390
wordfence you probably see me over at

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,619
the word fence booth raise your hand if

00:01:50,390 --> 00:02:01,340
I taught you how to pick a lock

00:01:51,619 --> 00:02:02,690
yesterday so in addition to that my

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,789
global information assurance

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,110
certification advisory board member and

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,350
a certified by the application

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,230
penetration tester it's all a bunch of

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,260
lofty language to say that I've done

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,650
some studying different tests and people

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,680
seem to like what I have to say about it

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,370
what I do ed to find is Brent analysis

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,920
or threat intelligence so I look at data

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,920
from millions of websites the firewall

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,150
logs malware scan activity and I try to

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,129
use that thing

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,349
all WordPress sites are getting attacked

00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:37,580
who's doing it and how we can better to

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,549
stop it from happening in the first

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,860
place outside of all that I'm just sort

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:44,269
of a standard-issue dead I've got a

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,920
beautiful two and a half year old

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,739
daughter but she is way cooler than you

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,890
and way smarter than me too so look at

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,890
me

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:58,370
so lately probably the last year or so

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,440
it really seems like information

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,349
security news is just constantly

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,239
dropping like every 45 minutes or so you

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,910
hear about some major service getting

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,859
breached all hell is breaking loose and

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,040
then they lost all of our passwords and

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,030
all their credit review and what with me

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,650
but there's actually a silver lining

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,780
here despite the fact that that can be

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,319
completely terrified for the layperson

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,489
we know that awareness is going up and

00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,799
this is definitely go to the vendor

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,060
level at the consumer level we know

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,569
vendors are becoming more open to

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,489
depower

00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,790
security because responsible disclosure

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,609
policies are coming out where if you are

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,790
a security researcher and you identify a

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:40,609
flaw in some software or some service or

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,870
something website or anything more and

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,700
more vendors and are willing to hear

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,489
about it they want you to tell them hey

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,440
I found this gaping hole in your

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,200
security posture they didn't please

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,970
kindly fix this before somebody else

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,459
does that isn't maybe quite a spectacle

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,349
is being and they can do this now

00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,819
without as much fear of reprisal because

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,859
before if you were sending something

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,019
like this to a company saying hey I

00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,919
found something do something about it

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:09,160
that reads like blackmail and you want

00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,109
to avoid that and so by opening the door

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,959
preemptively to this sort of thing we

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,930
establish that we could trust us

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,480
please just come tell us what's going on

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,780
and then now we receive more

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,600
as well so in addition to a lack of

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,950
reprisal for finding the sort of thing

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,610
we're also seeing where companies are

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,140
paying a help cash bonuses to the

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,840
individual to report security

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,270
vulnerabilities Google specifically has

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,130
an amazing bug bounty program if you

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,120
follow security news just about every

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,560
couple of months you're gonna hear about

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,900
some researcher in Chile or Singapore or

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,760
anywhere around the world who found some

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,160
interesting vulnerability in a Google

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,930
service reported it and then got kind of

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,190
checks like $17,000 two weeks later and

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,230
it's it's more and more common than

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,630
excellent because it's removing a lot of

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,580
the incentive to be a bad guy it used to

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,380
be you know you've got some skill and

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,470
happy you're not immediately working for

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,750
the government or working in security at

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,210
a company kind of amount of luck so you

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,740
might as well sell data already exploit

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,600
stuff steal credit cards or what have

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,190
you

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,630
on the consumer level though we know

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,520
that we're in a situation because the

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,040
security conscious lay person is

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,980
becoming a demographic that is just

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:32,410
actively marketed to about your and two

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,390
months ago well September 2017

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,580
does anybody know a little company

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:42,910
called Equifax you don't know what I'm

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,750
referring to that's awesome

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,910
so in September 2017 the credit

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,400
reporting bureaus Equifax disclosed that

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,510
there had been a massive security breach

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,150
at the time they said that there were

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,020
about a hundred and forty three million

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,650
accounts of user data that had been

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,780
leaked to god-knows-where and even later

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,740
on it was determined there was even more

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,930
than that and following that we see this

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,320
wave I mean if you listen to the radio

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,230
on your car there's a bottom about

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,710
billion percent chance that you've heard

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,480
of dark web analysis service where

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,220
there's a company that's promising you

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,650
that we're going to listen to chatter

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,600
the dark net and we're all the even bad

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,340
guys talk to each other and we're going

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,900
to tell you if we hear your name or your

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,750
email address or the name of your

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:36,940
company some of those I can pretty

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,720
confidently say that don't waste your

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,370
time but the fact is is they see a

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,290
market there they know that people are

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,410
more conscious of their security posture

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,700
than ever before and just because some

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,900
of them are a little exploitative of

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:56,470
that doesn't mean that they haven't

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:59,470
recognized people care now but despite

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:03,100
this improved awareness these attacks

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,080
keep succeeding so and then these aren't

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,680
really all super sophisticated attacks

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,200
either they're just unpreventable

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,650
golden bullets that can kill the sky

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,580
Equifax is Dave reach the woman to lead

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,740
140 something billion

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,009
user accounts was a vulnerability in

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,110
Apache struts vulnerability itself had

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,900
been patched two months prior to the

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,080
breach even beginning and they failed to

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,930
patch it until they identified it two

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,199
months after it had started so there is

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,330
a four month long gap where they knew

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,659
that there was a patch to be done and

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,830
had been doing it and saying I hadn't

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:45,889
gotten around to it as a little

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,050
reductive I mean we all work in places

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:52,599
where maybe an update needs to be feted

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,599
first but something that serious

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:03,020
more recently the atlanta god atlanta

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,150
georgia city government was hit by a red

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,969
support attack this has been March of

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,409
this year anybody not heard of that that

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:10,520
one's a little bit less publicized with

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,960
Indiana backs thing because it's a

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,880
little you know if you don't live in a

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,020
hurry or not the security spacy maybe

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,060
not maybe but they did almost the entire

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,180
Atlanta city governments network was

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,940
taken down by the Sam Sann ransomware

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,039
and there hasn't been a public

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,880
disclosure of the vector of that attack

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,640
yet but circumstantial evidence and just

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,020
the type of attack sort of seems to

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,360
suggest that the eternal blue

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,550
vulnerability was responsible that would

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,260
have been even less people heard of but

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,190
you may have heard of wanted right the

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,860
ransomware the swept Europe

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,330
mm hospitals all that water crap is

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,710
almost exclusively distributed through

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,040
this vulnerability the windows flight

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,040
engineers service and it comes down to

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,150
everybody seems to think they are the

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,560
exception and then they know that

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:06,270
there's an update they know it's a

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,450
security patch but for some reason I put

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,480
it off it'll be okay

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,200
it's at this point that I want to give a

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,950
little bit of audience participation

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,690
especially cuz it's the morning of the

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,880
second day of work camps all viewers not

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,340
bees just like me

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,500
so raise your hand you don't even have

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,840
to like move or get up or anything but

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,010
you do have to shout so raise your hand

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,050
if you want to improve the security

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:37,640
posture of your business by 30 percent

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:40,740
in five seconds right there

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:53,490
Glenn I want you to say my name is Glenn

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:55,740
and I'm not the exception now that we've

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,610
gotten past that we can start mixing

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,530
this a little bit so we're all on

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,930
WordPress it's kind of why we're here

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,940
WordPress powers 30% of the internet

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,890
right now and that is the insane and

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,320
it's 60 percent if you only count site

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,530
that are using some distributed content

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,630
management system a 30 percent market

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:19,620
share anything in his sort of legendary

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:24,300
I mean there's Coca Pepsi and whatever

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,490
but it's the simplest sort of supplied

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,030
commander it if there is a market or

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,640
people

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,430
something it is profitable to exploit

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,550
that it couldn't get more basic than

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:53,010
that and the example I like to give here

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:54,480
for this between 2007 to 2009 well it

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,800
was you know the first couple of years

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,810
the iPhone was out the smartphone's

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:03,240
coming to vote but this was also the

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,590
years that we were seeing on TV hi I'm

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,550
Matt hi the PC

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:13,890
hi I'm cool attorney hi I play chess by

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:17,730
myself or something the entire this was

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,950
back when Mac os10 had a bomb a four

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,000
percent market share the desktop space

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:26,430
and and this was this you know I'm only

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,150
for office software but I'm cool and I

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,520
have friends and do Photoshop stuff and

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:35,850
more than any of that you would see I'm

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,620
a PC and I was sick I have a virus

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,790
because that's what pcs do is they get

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:46,950
viruses what was me and then just long

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:50,010
as sitting there like skateboarders he's

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,120
fun because max don't get viruses that's

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,680
just how it works

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,090
and we see that's for about 2011 so this

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,820
has been going on for 40 years now

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,090
max market share is about it's about 8%

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,940
now still a little smaller than 30%

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,670
can you stop seeing this whole max don't

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,290
be a malware thing anymore

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:16,230
any guesses why because they did okay

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:18,320
and not so the market share increased so

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,770
more people want a piece of that pie

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,070
it's a bigger tie now but also there's

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,360
sort of this concept in the hackers base

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,160
and you'll see it in just about

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,790
everywhere but hackers are a little bit

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,930
notorious for this and it's it's the law

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,170
challenge accepted I know you tell me I

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,550
can't and let's watch what happens now

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,070
so we start seeing back to around we're

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,740
like oh it's ten pin deck and the black

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,330
hole remote access tool and they come

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,400
out of the scene and we stop hearing

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,010
this whole next time viruses thing as

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,930
much anymore I think that the general

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,340
populace has already allowed it to enter

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,290
into their consciousness and so even

00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,890
your Mac fanboy ISM that's still kind of

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:04,520
echoed that but their official marketing

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:07,130
stop being so heavily into that I bring

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,620
this up because well here we are

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,180
WordPress 30% of the internet if you're

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,860
spinning up a new website there's about

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,260
70% chance you're going to click

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,260
WordPress in your hosting account and

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:32,270
there's a knee-jerk reaction WordPress

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,560
is a really excellent remote with

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:38,750
blogging features it's clever it's kind

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,520
of a funny turn of phrase but it makes

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,650
me mad because I love WordPress and I

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,800
hope you guys do too and WordPress is

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:47,480
not even secure WordPress has an amazing

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,680
security team that's doing reviews of

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,330
things as they can

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,100
all of them are human and humans make

00:13:50,330 --> 00:14:01,130
mistakes that's a whole other talk I

00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:04,870
give and it's easy to make an insecure

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,560
WordPress site WordPress is not insecure

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:10,880
does that distinction not retain much

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,200
that's why I'm not here telling you that

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,040
wear dresses insecure and here's how to

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,520
stop that but here's how to make more

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,520
secure

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:26,250
so with awareness authorized and the

00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,950
knowledge that wordpress sites are

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,110
common targets you've probably come

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,300
across a guy of security best practices

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,910
things to do to help secure your

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,949
WordPress site and I would honestly be

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,720
astonished if I was the first person to

00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:45,690
be in front of you or write something to

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:50,399
you that says update your plugins it's

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:53,639
the first time anybody's heard that it

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,380
will fix it but well and in my opinion

00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,199
the gap here has to do with the

00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,820
difference between doing something like

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,339
factually speaking and understanding it

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,610
so for example I'll call myself out here

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:07,740
I can tell you that factually speaking

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,100
the Sun is about 10,000 degrees

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,300
Fahrenheit I'll also sit here and tell

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,949
you that I have no meaning to

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,630
understanding of what 10,000 degrees

00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:21,060
Fahrenheit is like my brain does auto

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:23,310
corrects it to really hot and when you

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,620
don't understand how an attacker is

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,140
getting into a WordPress site and you

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,430
hear that there's security epidemic and

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,079
you need to do these things to secure

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,079
your site it can kind of feel like

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,060
you're doing the emergency prep for a

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,490
dimensional like dragon attack like I

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,540
don't know the rules of Dragons what are

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,279
they going to do I don't know and so by

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,300
personifying this in a little bit more

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,850
than they had to do away

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,820
and explaining what happens in this

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,620
process hopefully just by making it

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,829
understood how this stuff happens you

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,560
can at least take a look critically at

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,769
your site and tell yourself some things

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,769
that you

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,889
and we're gonna do that then putting our

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,300
hacker hats on if you've been to the

00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,550
wordfence booth you've heard of spots

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,589
David you think like a hacker improve

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,790
your security posture that way the

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,040
length of your hat pretend on is

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,829
something that I want my sans

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,860
instructors used to rattle off a lot and

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,110
it makes a lot of sense because if

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,569
you're at death or your accountant or

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,800
your agency you InDesign you look at

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:32,290
everything through those eyes and it's

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,240
tough to switch your eyes out but you

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,559
you want to give a little critically of

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,059
the stuff from the perspective of

00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:41,709
somebody who wants to do something back

00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:43,240
to you and to do this we're gonna be

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,490
taking a look at two sets of examples

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,100
from start to finish

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,139
two attacks one attack is going to be

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:55,749
from a script kitty they referred that

00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:59,399
term before it yeah kie Vaal cat or

00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:01,600
anything so script kitty is sort of a

00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,819
derogatory term in the security

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,240
community for somebody who paints

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:09,309
themselves as a hacker and does naughty

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,569
things up there on the internet using

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:12,459
tools other people build without

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,230
understanding how they work it's okay to

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,240
use the tool somebody else build it's

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,880
less okay and not know how it works and

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,789
then you just sort of throw stuff out so

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,620
they're lower sophistication much higher

00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,720
in volume and you're also going to see

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,149
low ever bot attacks fall under this

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,290
same sort of field the other one we're

00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:32,780
going to look at is a bit more

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,200
this is going to be you say organized

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,179
crime person I don't know I started that

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,429
weird so if it's Stephanie above the

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,380
organized crime or a nation state level

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,660
attacker this is somebody where you know

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,390
they have some sophistication they have

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,309
the skill to do what they need to do and

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,500
money is probably no object as a nation

00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:57,170
state wants to break into something

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:59,059
they've got some budget behind it so

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,970
we're gonna be looking at it from these

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:05,240
four phases you know if you get into

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:07,549
security theory you're going to see a

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,950
much more detailed tree than this you

00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:12,410
can look up while your attack matrix

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:16,910
it's ATT ampersand CK because hackers

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:22,360
love that but for our purposes an attack

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:27,860
had about four steps discovery intrusion

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:30,470
infection and response like I said this

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,850
is an industry standard thing and your

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,620
attacker is definitely not sitting there

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,620
like oh I've entered the intruder phase

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,410
but it's handy to differentiated kind of

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,059
what state evenings happen that each

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,309
thing happens at because we're gonna

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:50,090
talk about a layered security model or

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:52,370
we're assuming failure so dividing this

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,150
in a nice manageable chunks gives us a

00:18:52,370 --> 00:19:00,049
perspective to look at this from and

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,059
hopefully prevent future attacks so

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,890
really to get the meat of containers in

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,330
this now so in our first example the

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,600
discovery phase we've got the script

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,290
Kitty has anybody seen an output that

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
looks kind

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,030
like this we recognize that I would like

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,930
to figure out who's who here but this is

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,240
the end of a tool called WP scam

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,630
very very popular WordPress black lots

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,000
of ulnar abilities and utility you can

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,700
point doesn't mean you shouldn't point

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,890
WP scan at any site on the internet that

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,440
you do not personally bone but worried

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,770
to do that it can enumerate a lot of

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,990
things it can find say probably most of

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,670
the usernames on that account where

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,550
WordPress doesn't care so much usernames

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,500
are not secrets or dress but we can also

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,840
a new write quite a bit of the plugins

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,840
that you've got installed and this is me

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,210
as an authenticated attacker just

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,800
looking for things like readme files on

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,090
your server in this case the text might

00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,850
be a little small there's a small screen

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,460
but we can see that there is an item

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,200
every one plug-in on this site and it

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,400
was a plugin called flicker and picture

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,580
back up it says it's up to date it also

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,940
said the last update for 2014 so that's

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,650
not super great and we'll talk about the

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,190
specific vulnerabilities in the next

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,200
step but the idea is there's not a lot

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,970
that you're really going to reliably

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,890
keep secret about your infrastructure

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,830
trying to do that is something called

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,120
security through obscurity the hot take

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,200
on security through obscurity is it's

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,320
pointless don't ever do it

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,050
in reality sure you don't make it the

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,040
only thing you do but it can slow down

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,750
sophisticated attackers for sure our

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,670
second example though with more

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:52,970
an attacker so that's just the biggest

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,410
dichotomy in this step is between an

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,780
unsophisticated attacker and a

00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,020
sophisticated one the script Kinney is

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,120
kind of just gonna put on a wide ad they

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:06,140
don't care who they're getting they just

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,270
want to negate backdoors Impaler as many

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,160
sites as many servers as they can they

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,780
don't care who you are they don't care

00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,600
that you think that you're a small site

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,550
and nobody knows you exist because as we

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,620
discussed already nothing's that secret

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,260
on the Internet but more in a

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,970
sophisticated attacker probably hasn't

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,180
even liked it maybe this is an

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,550
organization government organization

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,950
maybe this is just a business whatever

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,780
the case may be they've got somebody in

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,060
mind and now they're going to do a

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,420
little bit more about drill to find a

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:43,250
way in and the first step of this is

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:44,570
going to be Intel gathering this process

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,330
usually begins with a process called

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,860
ascent or open source intelligence and

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,580
this is where attackers are gathering

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,770
data about you about your company like

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,870
your website we're compiling it into

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,720
just this big portfolio so that we can

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,510
later refer to it and we know all the

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,300
stuff we need to so we're looking at any

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:08,000
publicly accessible information so

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:11,420
LinkedIn is a really big one if you want

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,310
an example of why if I'm curious to know

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:18,200
if business ABC what are they using on

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,600
the back end for the web framework well

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,030
if I go and I find

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,679
company LinkedIn profile and then from

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,750
there I find all their engineering staff

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,140
and every single one of them mentions

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,840
being an excellent reals developer

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,460
they're probably using rails same with

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,990
WordPress but we're pressing you're

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,200
probably guess that there's missing

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,770
somewhere statistically speaking things

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,770
like Twitter and Facebook if I'm looking

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,789
for a weak link in that organization if

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:51,429
I'm looking for maybe money stressed

00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:54,549
sysadmin maybe he's complaining on

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:57,460
Facebook about debt or not being able to

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,890
begin speak or oh boy christmas is

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,830
coming up and that's a nightmare and if

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,230
that's public and I find it well I'm a

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,200
nation-state attacker I can give this

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,330
guy a penance two dependents worth of

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,520
money for me but it's life-changing for

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,320
them and they'll probably plug in USB

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,400
stick into a server if I wanted to for

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,320
that well and that's not super great but

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,390
this Intel gathering stuff is where I'm

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,610
figuring this out so I'm scraping the

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,929
internet for email addresses because

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,909
maybe now I want to know how your

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,710
usernames are set up you know is it

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:31,809
first initial last name is it last name

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,130
first name with you know so if I can

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,159
find the email addresses I can do that

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:39,690
if I can spider out from there finding

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,690
your employees personal email addresses

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,570
password reach because I've got a

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:50,240
handful of those around ready to be

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:52,789
sifted through for a password and and

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,549
this one is a little bit more security

00:23:52,789 --> 00:24:00,529
theory but there's a tool called tool

00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:03,710
CDW help it's a word list generator so

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,380
you can throw tool at a website or a set

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,539
of sites and it's going to just spider

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,659
this site looking for instances of

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:13,070
unusual words and phrases by the

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,600
inaudible term everything but a

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:19,519
practical application we don't care

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,860
about the word but scanning a website

00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,809
for all these different words and uh

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,519
sorting them by how common they are is a

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:32,539
surprisingly effective way to start

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:34,429
guessing passwords so where's the take

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,750
aways during this discovery face because

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,179
we're looking at every phase one at a

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,990
time with the idea of preventing

00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:44,450
somebody from getting past it in example

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,399
one our script kitty probably would have

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,960
been sent back if that owner ability

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,419
scan they launched didn't find anything

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,889
or if there is a WebEx or web

00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,870
application firewall came in the way of

00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:56,840
preventing it from successfully scanning

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,789
or in some cases feeding it incorrect

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,659
information back to set month wild-goose

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:05,929
chase but that's warm just somebody

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:07,039
pesky exactly - does a little bit

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,240
tougher though you know you can't be

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,769
super draconian with all of your

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,460
employees and say I don't ever want you

00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,830
to say

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,110
work on social media never turn off your

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,670
Linkedin get off the Twitter like it

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,050
might be a little bit more secure but

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,550
you will just kind of like scare all

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,460
your plays away and you need to deal

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,410
with all that but you can do some

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,390
training build some awareness of the

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:32,120
sorts of things that probably shouldn't

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:34,580
be shared with the internet that kind of

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,390
you know non-critical thing a leakage

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:46,160
that could be compiled into a portfolio

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:50,320
or a Davis the next step so after the

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,550
discovery phase we've got intrusion

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,470
important part of the owner ability to

00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,530
suppose your process to produce proof of

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,630
concept so if you find a vulnerability

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,100
you want to prove that you found a

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,590
vulnerability to the people responsible

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,060
you build a thing that exploits it and

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,350
you just ship it to them and say hey

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,430
here it is here's how to do it

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,850
fix it now so from an earlier example

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,990
that took your picture backup plug-in no

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:19,160
the intended functionality of this

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:22,390
plugin is so in your admin dashboard you

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,860
can feed it the URL of a Flickr photo

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:29,000
image hosting service Tony interviews

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,860
anymore if you do a session but it

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,400
wasn't if you can point your admin

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,040
dashboard plug in this field your site

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,730
will reach out to Flickr and import that

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,020
photo in your media library maybe not

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,620
the way I would have implemented that

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,530
but yeah it's a plugin in the repo it

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:54,320
might not be anymore

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:56,720
but this plugin never did any let's

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,860
start from the top here so it didn't

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,070
check to see that what you were done

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,660
with it was from Flickr okay

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,740
it didn't check to see that what you

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,970
were downloading was an image and maybe

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm burying the lead on this a little

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,740
bit but it didn't even check to see if

00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,080
you were logged into WordPress now

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,780
they're gonna come together so you can

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,820
effectively just send a page B request

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,380
to this script if you can find the

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,350
plug-in on somebody cited with a free

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,870
tool called Toby piece again and just

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,780
point it at any URL know maybe it gave

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,970
overall maybe a pastebin link and now

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,920
we're pulling down arbitrary PHP code

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,850
storing it on their server in a place

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,100
that we can identify later maybe it's a

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,080
web show maybe it's some other malware

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,210
dropper because now I'm infecting a

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,770
website because it had a plug-in

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:51,590
installed that by the way was up-to-date

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,090
so we can talk about the virtues of not

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:59,480
using a plug-in that's been deprecated

00:27:53,090 --> 00:28:01,760
for years later but it's pretty bad and

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,950
so if you've identified that vector

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,830
exist the intriguing stuff is trivial

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,050
you just point it at a site you control

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:14,840
the word Sheldon you like and then

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:16,160
you're in example two and it's gonna be

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,890
a little bit more or up in the air

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,790
depending on what you find during this

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,170
until the other interface so with our

00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,850
gathering complete our professional

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,940
attackers is peering up to a temperature

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:32,789
fortunately for us the attacker not you

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,419
guys we have a control of email

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,500
addresses that we found these belong to

00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:39,299
corporate accounts but we've also gone

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,100
further than that associated a corporate

00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:44,120
account with a personal account maybe

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,710
multiple personal email accounts and

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,090
about terrible of you were associated

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:53,850
with password reaches from a while back

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:58,139
and if you so who's heard of the Paladin

00:28:53,850 --> 00:29:01,620
phone a little over here which is good

00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:05,159
like have I've been poned it's that's

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,889
the domain yeah I have I been pwnd d.com

00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,220
it's a service started by Troy Dillon a

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:13,139
security researcher out of Australia and

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,820
it's a really amazing utility that you

00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:17,549
can go and plug in your email address

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,649
it'll tell you all of the breaches all

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,490
the known breaches that that address is

00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:25,740
associated with now they won't spit back

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,139
out you know yes you have been gone and

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,490
here's the password so you can't just

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:35,100
like plug any buddies email into that

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,840
he's back but what you can do is look

00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,100
and see if you appear on it because

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,860
they'll tell you what breaches you're in

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,139
and if this is a breach that your

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,480
attacker has although and that password

00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:48,600
that they've got is still active

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,740
anywhere now they can kind of walk

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,299
through the front door they know your

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,990
password they know your email address in

00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:57,090
there we go now the odds of any one

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,650
individuals breach password from four

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:02,920
years ago appearing on your work

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:05,110
while their WordPress site is kind of

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,330
low if we're being honest but it's a

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,430
numbers game how many of these users did

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:13,570
I identify how many of those passwords

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,750
did identify it only takes one to make a

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:20,070
meaningful step into an organization's

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:35,820
infrastructure privileged account

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:39,070
privilege escalation is much easier yes

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,950
yep so this is a tech called credential

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,570
stuffing where we've identified a number

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,610
of passwords that have been previously

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,230
associated with you we don't know if

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,190
they're still associated with you but

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,760
we're going to throw stuff at the wall

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,440
and see what sticks depending on the

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,720
scope maybe we'll try it directly in

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,160
your WordPress site but maybe we'll use

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,780
all these other accounts we found maybe

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,030
we'll try to get in your Facebook or

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,910
your Gmail account maybe I want to do

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,950
some password resets elsewhere so the

00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,710
sophisticated attack is a lot of taking

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,470
a step pivoting or taking another step

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,900
this direction coding again because it's

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:18,130
not always as straightforward as oh they

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:20,140
have a holdover plug-in let's attack in

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,790
this case though for the sake of our

00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,560
argument we're going to say that they

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,560
were successfully able to authenticate

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,340
as an administrative user and upload the

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,170
malicious code

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,360
to the WordPress plug-in installer it's

00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,480
a very common broad Dyke

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:40,320
where if you've got admin just upload a

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:42,370
shell spread of and go from there so

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,390
what does it take aways during this

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:48,070
intrusion step this is where most of

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,740
your typical security best practices

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,510
show up so our target from the example

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,070
one probably shouldn't have been running

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:59,380
a plugin that hadn't been updated in

00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:01,660
four years is for number two though we

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,390
can all but entirely prevent potential

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,150
stuffing attacks by a using password

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,290
managers and never using the same

00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,040
password twice

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:13,660
I know exactly one password and it is

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,390
the one that unlocks my password manager

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:19,170
the rest of them are 20 to 40 characters

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,920
of garbage that I will never memorize

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,770
because I'm just pasting it in

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,350
everywhere another thing going on wants

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:31,890
to say is the most secure password is

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:35,050
the one you don't know we can also use

00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,400
so there there's through how that good

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,760
poem there's a service called the poem

00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,770
passwords getting into the technicals

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,510
might be a little waste of time within

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,450
the context of this talk but effectively

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,560
you can put your password in it checks

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,680
in anonymously you're not actually

00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,570
shipping your password out Detroit but

00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,980
they will tell you if that password is a

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:59,140
period reaches certain security plugins

00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,480
wordfence included will tell you if you

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,010
log in to your site and that password

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,870
appears in a breach so if you just

00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,610
installed it and you try to log in again

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,570
and it won't let you

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,820
it's probably because that past

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:15,830
has been seen somewhere we don't want

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,180
you to use that anymore and then also

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,790
implementing two-factor authentication

00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,980
is really important that way even if

00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,510
your password gets breached they still

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,160
can't log into your site without also

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,190
having a physical device that you

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,110
control it's still a big deal that they

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:36,160
have your password but maybe not quite

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:39,530
so operational now the infection step is

00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,320
where it gets a little bit more 3/4

00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,210
because now we're in we've gotten into

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,030
the first time which is a landmark an

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,880
attack right the first time you get into

00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,770
a system that doesn't want you there is

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,970
where we're doing all this you know OS

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,230
in gathering and exploiting

00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,330
vulnerabilities in plugins and stuff but

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,720
once we've gotten it once we kind of

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,440
have free rein to enable ourselves to

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,440
come and go as we please

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,669
in the case of our less sophisticated

00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,500
attacker we're going to see kind of a

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:17,210
staple of Internet malware a spam mailer

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,260
this is an example of a real spam really

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:24,080
it's a pretty basic one the idea is even

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,840
if you're some like why would anybody

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,929
happen you have a nobody kind of website

00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,360
your major outgoing mail relay on your

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,750
hosting account probably hasn't been put

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,740
on any spam blacklist yet I would like

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,980
to fix it so we can throw spam blog on

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,850
there and start sending out spam email

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,260
maybe this is you know sketching pills

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:52,070
advertising things is some other kind of

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,590
spam marketing but maybe we're launching

00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,030
other types of attack from here what we

00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,899
see in a lot of cases is these spam

00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:03,099
mailers are going to

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:05,359
to send out phishing emails go fishing a

00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:07,160
lot of the cases where you're going to

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,720
see somebody getting fished they're

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,910
gonna get an email that says hey I'm

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,500
from DHL and your package is stuck

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:16,190
somewhere do we need to log in and tell

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,480
me what to do with it or hey we found

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,950
some weird activity on your PayPal

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,089
account log in and let's figure it out

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:26,630
and there will be a link in that email

00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:30,829
that takes you to box quilting site.com

00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,450
slash PayPal and it looks like a PayPal

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:39,650
site it's definitely not PayPal don't

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:41,720
put anything in there but using this as

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,089
a platform to direct recipients to

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:49,010
phishing or malware droppers is a very

00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:54,140
large and lucrative thing to do that's

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,980
how all of these cases pictures our

00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,420
second example

00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:06,950
does everybody know what that device is

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:09,619
there anybody seen those before it gets

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,200
credit card skimmer on ATM so you can

00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:14,119
actually see the plastic shell that

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,520
somebody's pulled off of the identical

00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,870
plastic shell

00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,710
a little chip in it that can read your

00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:26,630
card as it goes into the legitimate ATM

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:30,170
Barberie we see things like that on the

00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,750
e-commerce sites where we're harvesting

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,530
with credit cards we're harvesting

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,110
usernames and passwords of these

00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,090
accounts and this isn't something where

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,740
we can just throw an ssl certificate or

00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,490
TLS i really need to get out of that

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,930
have it TLS encryption is not going to

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,950
stop this because they're not snatching

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,840
it out of the sky

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,570
they're making their copy before they

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,560
even send it to the payment processor

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,630
and then they're sending that off of

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,910
their selves or or just logging at

00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,380
somebody get picked up later and they're

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,190
doing this by just injecting a little

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,480
bit of JavaScript into the website

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,400
really really hard for the layman to

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,050
detect some JavaScript really quietly on

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,160
a payment gateway so if they're get

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,210
something like that place then

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,010
potentially every credit card

00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:18,980
transaction that goes through it it is

00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:21,500
compromised what they'll do is they'll

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,760
find themselves scraping it out and

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,840
selling it wholesale

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,400
rather than using every little particle

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,690
Bettany's here as if it reached this

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,690
point they like they got a pretty

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,970
serious foothold in your account and the

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,390
worst part is is reminder

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,490
yeah so taking care of the infection

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,109
itself holding the next step our job in

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:45,670
this phase is simply to become aware of

00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:48,099
the infection as early as as possible so

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:52,240
I've kind of degree I was that one

00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:53,589
fairly slow so response for our example

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,450
one so site perfected with the spam

00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:57,490
alert probably sending out a lot of

00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,930
email the idea here is to keep your

00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:02,650
finger on the pulse of what's happening

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:05,440
in your server if you're seeing a big

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,839
use of our mail relays if you're seeing

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,270
CPU spiking though get lost with

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,710
increase in traffic to a California if

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,329
you're monitoring the stuff you can

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,819
identify what something is happening

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:17,200
better yet you can use some kind of

00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:18,940
intrusion detection system like a

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,560
malware scanner and that'll at least

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,839
lighten when something has been found

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,940
malware scan is not necessarily between

00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,410
us every possible backdoor but the

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,060
earlier that you can be notified that

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,619
something has happened the more time you

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:33,280
have to respond to it before everything

00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,960
completely explodes I on the other hand

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,190
approach card skimmer is generally going

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,230
to be brought to the attention of the

00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:42,099
site owner through something called a

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:44,520
common purchase log where I have seen 60

00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,650
breached credit cards

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,800
at this point and I've had 60 breach

00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,620
credit cards and 59 of them have all

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,930
made a brief a recent purchase from your

00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,480
website they're gonna notify you with

00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,460
that and then you can do an audit there

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,090
in the middle Germany probably about to

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,700
try that together in the case of

00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:08,070
resource that detects like spam dealers

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,470
just keep an eye on your server usage

00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:14,430
stats and then for a card skimmer

00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,590
cleaning services and stuff like that

00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:23,730
are going to help mitigate that but this

00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:25,770
is why we're always making backups again

00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,540
don't rely on malware scanner to

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,700
completely clean everything for you if

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,110
you've got a malware scanner and it's

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,190
telling you we found three things and we

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,640
cleaned three things you're definitely

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:38,010
good man it's all good well maybe they

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,590
didn't find something this is an

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,350
intrusion detection it's an indicator of

00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:48,000
compromise it's not a list of everything

00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:50,430
wrong with your website and at the same

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,340
time try to ignore the desire or at

00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,620
least not act on the desire to hunt down

00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,510
and kill your attacker because it's not

00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,860
gonna work first of all and the IP

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,910
address you're going to see in your logs

00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,370
probably doesn't really have anything

00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,640
the geographical location of the person

00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:08,800
attacking you VPNs are cheap tor is free

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,090
and the odds are probably attacking you

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,930
from another server they've infected

00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:18,490
anyway um

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,020
threat modeling is a big thing it could

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,460
probably be its own talk by itself but

00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,160
it can be summed up into one question

00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,930
what do I have that you might want and

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,960
then subsequently kind of a footnote

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:33,340
there is how hard will they work to get

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,100
it in the context of larger

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,780
organizations you may have personal

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,700
records of employees that I want you may

00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,440
have client data you may have a number

00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,290
of things that they that I might want an

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,120
actual trade and while their particular

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,750
information may not be sitting on your

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:55,390
wordpress site I can probably use that

00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:58,450
to pivot and get somewhere else so the

00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:00,160
largest thing here is assumed breach at

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,650
every stage of this process through

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,800
every step of the way you want to assume

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,040
that the previous one has failed you

00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,650
cannot really adequately plan for an

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,690
incident response when you confidently

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,800
believe that nobody will ever get to the

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:19,930
step in the first place threat modeling

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,030
and risk analysis is a big thing you're

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:25,140
calm and I'm not but that's pretty bad

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:27,520
specifically but if you assume breach

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,750
it's better than the only alternative

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,970
which is to assume that you have not

00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:37,740
been reached I'll tell you which one of

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:40,910
those is more secure Thanks

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,910
[Applause]

00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,849
we've got a few minutes for questions

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,849
there's a microphone in the middle there

00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,599
yeah I was just wondering if you had any

00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,760
recommendations as far as a researcher

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,950
who is looking at your business and

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,170
trying to find personal information and

00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:15,230
he returns us out there for seeing what

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,119
you have that's public and you know so

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:23,420
that you can like identify things that

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:27,950
maybe shouldn't be public and so there

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:30,170
is a lot of it's just going to be what

00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:33,560
can you do yourself there there are

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,450
aggregators out there if there was one

00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,710
thing to write down it would be OS and

00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:41,869
framework it's a website you can go and

00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,670
this is this really really enormous

00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:45,109
spider tree of different categories of

00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,050
stuff that you can use for information

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:51,050
gathering and it will provide its own

00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:54,140
set of tools from there another part of

00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:56,869
it is just kind of understanding at some

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,160
level what is valuable data and where

00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:01,040
that kind of thing lives so like the

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,480
LinkedIn thing where I what

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,829
infrastructure or the organization is

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,280
using so I'm going to see what their

00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:08,569
engineers are bragging about a link to

00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,460
it that's just going to kind of come

00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:14,359
from understanding of the human element

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,610
and getting into things like social

00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,150
engineering which is

00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:21,070
it's a whole other talk there's a lot of

00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,020
data that can be manipulated in a bad

00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,970
way even so much as telling somebody

00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,970
what pest control service your office

00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,680
uses tells them what uniform to buy or

00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:34,780
steal to get on the minute access to

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,060
your business so it's it's tough to say

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,720
because this is kind of like

00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,560
simultaneously everything at nothing so

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,090
it's something that you want to look at

00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,640
case-by-case and see what's going to be

00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:48,520
relevant to your specific business and

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,620
so as I'm very particular for that but

00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,500
really just Google the names of

00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:57,010
employees Google email interested to see

00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:06,370
where things have shown out as far as

00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:10,180
actual breach data resource it is you

00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:12,580
mentioned password managers I've kind of

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,620
been staying away from those because I'm

00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,119
afraid if somebody gets in there they've

00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,999
got all of them so how do you know how

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,150
one that's chestrig so that's a really

00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,150
good question

00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:27,170
having a single point of failure with

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:31,400
your password managers is very case to

00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,839
begin at the same time if you are your

00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,609
own single point of failure that you're

00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:37,130
in the exact same spot you left so

00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,749
there's there's a lot of cloud-based

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,660
password managers out there

00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:43,009
LastPass one password and then you hear

00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,900
cases where somebody's LastPass account

00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:48,319
gets breached and that can be

00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:51,470
devastating but it is a much smaller

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,230
surface area much much smaller

00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,910
likelihood of compromised than having

00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,920
one universe password that you keep in

00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:01,819
your head the news everywhere I

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,269
personally use KeePass it's a it's not

00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:08,240
cloud-based it can be made cloud-based

00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:10,700
if you sync it through Dropbox or I use

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,349
a personal bank account my basketball is

00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,999
on every one of my devices synchronize

00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:16,970
to each other but never talks to a third

00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:19,130
party that I do not control but I owe me

00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,739
you are not necessarily me that might

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,539
not be necessary by any third party

00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:26,920
service like LastPass or one pass is

00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:26,920
going to be better than nothing

00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:40,170
I'm curious on what your opinion on the

00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:42,789
company out here that has the QR scanner

00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:46,359
to get into WordPress instead of

00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:54,069
username password is that a valid step

00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:57,789
that we should tend I haven't had time

00:45:54,069 --> 00:46:00,069
to personally vetted heaven in time for

00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:01,690
personal new pet that particular

00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:07,839
implementation for my understanding it's

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:10,509
is furious down so it's not that this is

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,900
some magic QR code that gets you into a

00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:16,329
site what it is is we are showing a QR

00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,900
code to a user on a desktop and then

00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:21,940
their phone which is authenticated and

00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:25,739
is associated with this account with so

00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:30,400
whichever device shows us this QR code

00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:32,710
brings that account to that computer so

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,049
it's if somebody else has a phone and

00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,460
snap that QR code it's not that your

00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:37,960
account is getting that to their phone

00:46:36,460 --> 00:47:04,989
it's that their accounts goes out to

00:46:37,960 --> 00:47:10,989
your computer but so you have two basic

00:47:04,989 --> 00:48:13,989
profiles I was wondering if there was

00:47:10,989 --> 00:48:16,769
you know targeting so this is under the

00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,769
CEO were events

00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,609
[Music]

00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:10,800
yeah for for the people in spearfishing

00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,810
campaigns I haven't seen it and that is

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,030
what would fall under more sophisticated

00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:16,920
you don't really need to be a super

00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,120
legit computer hacker to do a spear

00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,250
phishing campaign you just need to know

00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,240
how to trick someone but it is a little

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,880
bit higher effort than throwing a

00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,920
scanner and some things but it is very

00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,020
real where we see cases of somebody

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,450
building this profile and then launching
