Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Malicious activity is an unfortunate reality when maintaining a web presence today. Most people involved in the web industry know someone who encountered the aftermath of a disruptive attack–if they haven’t themselves. Because of this, awareness of security best practices is at an all-time high. To many, though, it may not be clear exactly why these measures are important.
To remedy that, we’ll be taking a practical look at what’s actually happening when a website gets attacked, as well as discussing the hows and whys along the way. From understanding why small sites still get hacked, to why password reuse is really as bad as everyone says, we’ll explore the rationale behind the security principles you’re always being told to follow.
