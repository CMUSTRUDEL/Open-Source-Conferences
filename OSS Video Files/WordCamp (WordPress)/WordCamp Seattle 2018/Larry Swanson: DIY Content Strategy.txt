Publication date: 2020-04-06
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	WordPress agencies and freelance designers and developers can improve their client’s website projects by incorporating content-strategy best practices into their workflows. Anyone who has built more than one website has developed a good array of content strategy skills. I’ll show how to plug those skills into a proven framework for crafting an actionable, state-of-the-art website content strategy. If you’ve ever used “lorem ipsum” copy as you struggled to extract content from your client the day before launch, this talk is for you.

diversity and outreach team

00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:44,269
thanks for so content strategy is I'm

00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:46,309
hoping to make the case this morning

00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:48,109
that it's it's more important than you

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:49,910
think and that you should care and worry

00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,679
about it more one at the point I'm going

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,910
to give you some tools to actually do it

00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,579
that's kind of a point of all time so

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,559
yeah so stay tuned a content strategy

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,499
raises a lot of questions

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,200
my first question is the neck is here

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:10,850
and I've talked about this project I've

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,890
come to discover this kind of three main

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,570
audience is we've expressed interest in

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,880
this DIY approach and strategy so first

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,829
our agencies and developers design

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,850
people making websites for other people

00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:29,630
my how many people here would identify

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:32,000
like that to make good for website

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,540
owners bloggers publishers people who

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,970
publish

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,370
and here's another category I've

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,530
identified and think of as accidental

00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,350
content strategist gives project

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,570
managers marketing manager the UX person

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,930
who's like oh David he can do the

00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,250
website he knows about WordPress how

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,010
many people would identify like that you

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,110
sort of task on the fly with managing

00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,420
and wrangling okay so we've got a good

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,070
mix of of all the different types of

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,690
folks you might be interested

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm carrier so there are other people

00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,080
though anybody would identify not in one

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,970
of those groups

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:19,090
wait back what do you guys do okay like

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,770
education okay great thanks so so why do

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,240
you even need content strategy in the

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,060
first place that's the the first

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,410
question about this if you come out

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,600
there's number perspectives to look at

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,610
it first if you're a consumer of content

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,410
nowadays you're facing on fire you're

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,150
out of entry I mean it's just coming at

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,320
you from all over the place and the

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,360
content that you're putting out there

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,769
just adding it up by rows you want to be

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,450
strategic and thoughtful consumers are

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,640
discredited they've got a lot of other

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,040
things to worry about plenty of other

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,200
stuff they can be reading or doing the

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,850
care strategic about your content it's

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,489
easier to catch their attention to grab

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,560
and grab and hold their attention if

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,310
you're a content creator you know coming

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,050
up with ideas in PR and having a good

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,230
content strategy in place can help you

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,540
that also help you with having a good

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,980
content you know

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,959
boundaries one of the features of the

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,060
content strategy is having a plan in the

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,950
calendar and reasons in place can help

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,750
you kind of set deadlines and then of

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,519
course it has been a lot of stress but

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,099
these things happen when you have

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,900
deadlines if you're a Content meter like

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,450
if you're designing developing websites

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,970
for other people the content can look

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,950
like this giant obstacle so what you're

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,519
trying to accomplish it's like where the

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,840
heck is the client content and it's that

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,280
thing that keeps you up at night

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,690
worrying about like oh crap we're

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,690
launching in a week and I don't have a

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,260
client's content yet so what do you do

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,060
Laura Matt's right I just want to put it

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,139
into them forever i just i am ready and

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,140
i just thought i'd line this morning

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,960
here title block title

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,870
for those hoping it's supports what I'm

00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,930
about to say I want to preface this next

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,580
size by saying that this comes from a

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,590
leading authority and content strategy

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,540
world one of the original kind of

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,310
founders of the discipline an important

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,020
person a delightfully snarky Midwestern

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,000
I appreciate the join but I want to say

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,620
that this is like I want to take

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,510
everybody to task for being bitter about

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,459
content strategy but Kristina Halvorson

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,150
in brain traffic because then I think

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,440
the best look at it for for for people

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,510
to build sites for the people so what

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
she said it was like typical web agency

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,050
proposal propose blah blah blah

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,180
discovery of your mind about blah blah

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,940
blah client can be responsible for

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,840
everything contact and she says that'd

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,220
do content spread is not 2004 and what

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
she's getting at is that they sort of

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,210
like and then this gets into some of the

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,270
concepts we'll talk about later but if

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,500
you're doing a website you guys all of

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,240
this you're doing looks like foreign

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,960
intent for a marketing tent or business

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,000
intent of some kind and it's it's even

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
if you're not just even if you're not a

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,290
Content strategist but are designing

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,720
developing otherwise building websites

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,540
for people I would argue that you wanna

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,100
you know I - not as most difference

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,150
about it is Kristine Allison is but

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,520
she's way more authoritative

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,050
I am so trust her anyhow but I would

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,180
argue that we should all be doing

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,919
content strategy even if you just even

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,110
feared individual like a solo profession

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,440
which is that one social media feed you

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,970
want to be strategic about that there's

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,550
a lot of business reasons to be

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,290
strategic about content so how many

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,350
people in here have an unlimited budget

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,890
unlimited

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,740
and resources create content not a

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,940
single hand one guy in Vancouver not a

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,150
couple weeks ago actually raised his

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,130
hand enough like blood so I know

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,350
important that's right any now so you

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,810
want to be a diligent Stuart Shepard of

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,730
the scarce resource by being strategic

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,740
about your content that's one of the the

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,380
main benefits of having new content

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,480
strategy you want to focus i mean having

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,890
to focus to your content evidence is

00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,110
crucial you go back to that thing about

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,530
the distracted consumer you've got to be

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,240
you've got to be focused votes on what

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,130
they need what you have to offer and

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,340
kind of content strategy and helping

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,380
bring that focus to your content efforts

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,970
you again back to the distracted guy

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,370
with porn is orange juice in this bowl

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,960
of cereal you need to get that person

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,420
attention one of the best ways to do

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,160
that is to show your uniqueness we all

00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,800
have something you better have something

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,870
to need or you might as well not be on

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,820
the web because the you know as to go

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,830
everything is so much more difficult and

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,390
so I'd be having a good time content

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,970
strategy in place can help me

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,500
demonstrate that unique set of skills

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,300
attributes values and things that you

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,150
bring to the table that'll get people to

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,890
appreciate your business more finally

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,750
from a business perspective content

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,909
strategy is like this Swiss Army knife

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,860
of

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:50,729
like if you're running an SEO campaign

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,869
that's all about content content because

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,899
if you're doing trying to serve your

00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:58,029
customers better anything that involves

00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:00,279
serving your customers probably has

00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,800
recalls certainly has a content element

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,110
to it and so having a content strategy

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,399
mindset gives you this nice little Swiss

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,740
Army ID you can pull out whenever

00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,939
whatever it is you're doing and bring

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,439
that to bear another question that comes

00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,809
up about content strategy all the time

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,990
is just this word content like I'm an

00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:22,749
old school publishing journalism guy and

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:28,569
it just content it's so demeaning and

00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:30,580
kind of vague Eric I've come this peace

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,459
with the term content and for a few

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,309
reasons first of all it's a good label

00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:39,279
to identify the unique kinds of you know

00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:41,139
words and images and recordings and

00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,509
search results whatever it is here that

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,550
whatever the content is here the

00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,729
information dealing with content is a

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,439
good label for this kind of digitized

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,719
stuff that we're dealing with now and

00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,909
the ensuing kind of complexity and

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,399
interconnectedness of that content it's

00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,779
really what makes this feel like content

00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,669
strategy necessary when I was in

00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,729
publishing twenty twenty-five years ago

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:06,249
you didn't need a content strategy you

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,930
just publish books nowadays and

00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,199
similarly you know journalists did their

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,059
thing

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,009
Regan's did their thing now we're all

00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:14,669
multimedia omni-channel publishers

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:17,379
because that we need a content strategy

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,869
so that digitization of it and the

00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,389
complexity of it that makes it feel that

00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:23,820
makes that term content dan you know

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,270
that's why I've come to these

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm cranky but anymore the other way to

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,320
look at content is Karen McGrane the

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,910
other governments or the original

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,160
governor of the field of content

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,880
strategy philadelphia-based that content

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,070
strategist

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,840
she says that content is the gift you

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,490
know if you're publishing the website

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,960
people that you know unless you have

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,860
like a coke remote or design portfolio

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,960
people aren't coming to your site to

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,380
admire the code or the way the thing

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,690
works or to are to admire your design

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,580
they're coming to learn something to do

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,740
something to achieve an intent and

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,660
content is what does that so content is

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,010
they give inside of a beautiful website

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,400
you're designing in a beautiful

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,470
functionality that you're crafting

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,640
finally content is that message this

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
comes out of like work in the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,270
communications just topple the

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,250
communications in general it's both the

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,470
top-level messaging of what you have to

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,030
say and how you can make your values and

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,060
your unique value proposition to the

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,310
community it's that and it's also all

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,930
the individual messages that you have

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,090
the same so that manifests in a

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,000
gazillion ways if you have a website you

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:34,110
have a blog you have your YouTube

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,840
channel your podcast feed your social

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:41,820
media feed for Facebook or Twitter so

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,680
again that's those are a few ways to

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,920
look at content it's like this digitized

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,750
complex' thing that needs to be

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,230
privatized without it's a gift that

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,390
you're giving

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,510
customers and it's a thing that

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,650
manifests in a bunch of different ways

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,170
now that leads the question what the

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,180
heck is content strategy I sent out

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,140
about a year just over a year ago but

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:07,440
I've been a digital publisher for 95 23

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,150
years and I got tired of explaining

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
people what a publisher is and what a

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,210
publisher does and it's like forget it

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm done with our conversation

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,600
don't ya talk don't ask me about it no I

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,160
actually seriously

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,330
I'm having to talk about it but just not

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,430
to explain my whole professional

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,010
existence around that so I really

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,450
identified as a content managers and the

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,890
first thing I discovered started talking

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,480
to a bunch of people and everybody

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,570
thought of content strategy is a

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,390
different thing and I was like is this

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,950
like community or wellness or these

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,990
other words they're just like these made

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,760
a cooperative things where you could

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,440
dump a bunch of stuff I thought now I

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,830
have a feeling there's something more to

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,930
this

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,460
so all that my reporters know but my

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,000
original training with other journalists

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,680
so having put on my reporting hat and

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,990
set out to kind of demystify and

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,690
understand what they have content

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,180
strategy is so what I just got went up I

00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,730
read every book I could find I looked at

00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,970
every online reading list that was out

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,750
there

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,940
I am listen every podcast that was out

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,950
there then I created my own podcast a

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,410
content strategy interviews I now

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:15,480
interview anyhow andrea was my 34th

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:19,080
interview I did that 30 40 interviews

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,769
live stream on content strategy I took a

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,360
bunch of online courses window

00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:26,720
great course on context right here's a

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,069
bunch of other ones out there I went to

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,739
confab to make this sort of the

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,749
definitive canonical comment strategy

00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:36,050
conference a bunch of other events I

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:39,559
joined the local content strategy we're

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,170
going to immerse myself in this and I've

00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,459
looked at every chart diagram if you

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,799
want to be a professional content

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,749
strategist there are a gazillion ways to

00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,279
understand like as a professional

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,110
practitioner how we fit into the

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,769
enterprise and the projects that you're

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,980
working on

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,959
probably best exemplified by this this

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,879
is from Kristina Halvorson southla brain

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,889
traffic in Minneapolis this is their

00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,519
famous quad which actually is why I

00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:08,809
don't want but that's another thing but

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:11,239
of the elements of content strategy so

00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:12,769
if you want to be a professional content

00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,749
strategist you know you can do what I

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:17,029
did said spend six months or a year just

00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:18,949
go out you know explore take some

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,049
classes do a bunch of reading and I feel

00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:22,489
you know and through those interviews I

00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,600
realized look and well that's the thing

00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,939
one of the things that would be these

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,170
interviews is that everybody comes to

00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:29,869
content strategy from them from a

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,629
different angle perspective background

00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,399
and so I was typical in that way people

00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:38,779
who identify as content strategies I

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,429
have publishing everybody has a story

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:44,089
like that does it come into content

00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:45,439
strategy so I am so that that left me

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,869
with a question like great if I can

00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,429
figure this out well actually at the end

00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:51,889
of that process as I was figuring this

00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,829
out I was like well this is behind Andy

00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:56,119
but as I started talking to my friends I

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,190
have a lot of time friends who are like

00:12:56,119 --> 00:13:01,110
run small development design

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,089
marketing agencies people who run their

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,199
own websites people have small

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,779
businesses that have a website

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:08,430
associated with it they don't they're

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,649
never going to have an extra six months

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,060
okay dramatic logic learn this stuff

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,180
they're never going to have the budget

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,899
to hire somebody like me to do this for

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,220
them so it's like is they're open and so

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,779
what I then the next thing I discovered

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,100
was like wait a minute does that look at

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,459
all the stuff I've learned it's not

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,629
rocket science this is there's a whole

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,889
string of activities and that's what I

00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,389
began to wonder about is there a way

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,819
that I could stream these activities

00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:34,819
together into an actionable list of

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,509
executable steps that anybody would then

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,699
of a modicum of business sense ability

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,439
to do and it turns out the answer is yes

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:45,959
the content strategy is not this

00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:47,879
mysterious amorphous thing that I first

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,480
thought it was a year ago it's a totally

00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,550
doable activity that anybody can do so

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,540
gonna do a whirlwind tour of how to do

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,129
that I can't teach you the whole thing

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,170
right now there are people who spend

00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:59,819
your there people who have jobs doing

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,829
one little tiny aspect at this whole

00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,930
time but I'm moving you over to you but

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,939
the other thing about it it can be

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,639
executed in any number of levels you can

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:10,110
spend an afternoon at your kitchen table

00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,000
sketching out a content strategy and be

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,250
better off for doing that using these

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,069
same steps as like a big enterprise like

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,839
an air B&B they have like people in

00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:20,459
their content strategy office just here

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,949
in Seattle that's a branch office so

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,160
this scales nicely and that kind of gets

00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:27,149
at the point that one of the things that

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,430
several of my interviewees and I've

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,170
discovered is I talked

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,120
other content strategist is that

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,640
everything in this world is bespoke it's

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,470
all custom tailored to your individual

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,820
you know to whatever to wear out of it

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,070
wherever it is you're applying your

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,160
content strategy it's going to be unique

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,000
so so as I go through these steps that

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,410
are coming up

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,149
they've just realized that some of these

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,529
will be things you can tick off in two

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,420
minutes and some of these will be things

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,649
you have to take a deep dive on you

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,330
might do in a slightly different order

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,290
in the organization some of the work may

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,110
already have been done in the

00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:02,120
organization but I want to show you sort

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:04,130
of like the stages that are involved in

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,890
a typical content strategy so it's good

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,510
to know oops the first stage is

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,709
discovered you want to figure out we're

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,270
going to go into more detail about you

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,370
each in just a minute but I just want to

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,890
quickly outline the whole process of

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,839
content strategy first you have a

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,730
discovery phase like everybody does this

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,350
like who are you what are you doing

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,029
what's your business intent what are

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,200
your customers need what kind of

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,480
resources do you have to spend on this

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,860
they said the combination of actually

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,300
figure out what your content mission is

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,850
then you take that you take that

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,580
information figure out a plan the

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,589
strategy for getting from where you are

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,630
at that desired state you've imagined

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:44,990
and setting out here your content

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,190
mission then you want governance is that

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,620
it's one of these terms like that scheme

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,120
together is like documentation but you

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,010
want to have a plan in place to make

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,390
sure that this beautiful party strategy

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,880
that you've articulated it actually

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,830
happens then you get into the fun stuff

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,080
you design your content now content

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,240
design is way different from graphic

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,520
design or

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,589
architecture other disciplines it's a

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,630
will talk to the more detailed detail

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,360
about that then you build your content

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,560
creation system and then you publish now

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,330
this I want to point out here this is

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,690
like with the famous five minute

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:19,330
WordPress install you can six minutes

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,860
from now to be publishing I hope I can

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,300
make the case that you want to do these

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,230
other five things before you get to that

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,790
stage so that's my local tenure one of

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,250
the one of my interviewees call them

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,120
that kind of activity random acts of

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,040
content

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,920
so let's come into random acts of

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,600
pumpkin and then finally need to manage

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,779
the whole the whole shooting match the

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,310
whole process so let's go through each

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,380
of those in a little more detail there's

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,940
sort of several steps each of these and

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,649
these are articulated by the way I'll

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,029
point that up in the end but these are

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,670
all you don't need to take notes they're

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,620
all articulated as a checklist on my

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,630
website you see I run content strategy

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,550
calm and you can grab this and that's

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,589
licensed like with a Creative Commons

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,570
chair chair like just like the GPL you

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:05,020
can do what you want with that checklist

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:08,110
as you incorporate into yourself so the

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,699
discovery stage and the number steps the

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,800
first thing and this came up over and

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,010
over again as I've researched the field

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,990
content strategy is about 90% about

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,160
people you know there's a lot of stuff a

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,050
lot of writing to be done a lot of

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,679
content to be created a lot of things to

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,800
be done but it's all done by people and

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,800
you need to be attended to

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,510
every stage in your content ready so the

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,580
very first step is you want to get

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,900
connected with your stakeholders the

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,460
other people write the checks for your

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,560
budget people we're going to create the

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,910
contact assuming there's a whole bunch

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,830
of it and again this is going to be

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,110
different in every organization but you

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:46,770
want to figure out who is affected in

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,560
any way by or can affect in any way your

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,040
content of efforts and get it ahold of

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,070
them

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,810
you want to discover your why why are

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,660
you even doing this and that's sort of

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,700
like a very high top level I could think

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,740
the business crews is the good - great

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,210
guy

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,520
and yeah there's a business career that

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,520
was part of Jim Collins thank you

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,930
assignments in assignments enacted the

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,850
classic has everybody seen that video

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,430
Simonson activity it's the second most

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,960
viewed Ken talk of all time it was

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,050
filmed right here in Seattle recorded

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,360
years ten years ago and simon Sinek says

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,090
people don't buy what you do or how do

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,920
we do it they buy stuff because of your

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,020
why they use either the example of

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,340
animal like you don't this is a great

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,470
computer blah blah blah all these

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,570
features and we do it we build it this

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:46,350
way because we're past people whatever

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:53,040
and you want to buy one he goes no this

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:54,690
is the correct way like computers you

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,800
can kind of glimpse the power of bots

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,600
right in there

00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,040
so an app so you want to discover your

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,040
why you can do that like values

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,530
your your sub this this gets a little

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,940
tricky and we can do questions more

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,250
question than the deep lore about the

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,320
skin but in terms of this it's like the

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,900
why of your current initiative now this

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,000
gets into the kind of me up the fractal

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,500
nature of content strategy I would argue

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,240
that every organization now should have

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,070
achieved content officer he's looking at

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,309
everything from website microcopy and

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,669
app alerts to the knowledge base you

00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,650
know you have any others that's just my

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,179
perspective on this but but content

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,559
strategy commands tested a whole bunch

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,590
of different levels it can be an SEO

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,549
campaign content marketing campaign

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,950
social media can take a whole bunch of

00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,090
different places it can control out you

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:48,690
want to figure out the why for your

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:50,610
current that make sense well if you have

00:19:48,690 --> 00:20:02,220
the intent of the stuff of the other

00:19:50,610 --> 00:20:03,750
client exactly yeah yeah so why the

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,059
intent of the content effort that you're

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,320
doing yeah yeah and then you want to get

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,340
clear on your business model I think

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,799
I've been doing this a long time and

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,659
even to this day I'm still there's kind

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,250
of like three main business model to

00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:19,530
give me a publisher you'd be publishing

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,330
content for its own use you can be able

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,490
to commerce the merchant the commerce

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,760
site and the selling stuff you can a

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,820
market another flavor kind of a variety

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,000
of each of those but you just want to be

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,789
super clear on what your business

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,470
and also much your business goals like

00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,789
why you know what's your current and its

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,070
kind of expect your question about the

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,389
scope of your why like what is your

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,740
current mission what are the kids

00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:44,120
current business goals you're trying to

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,059
get there and how is content gonna

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,549
support that and this it's number five

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:51,230
here but if you really be number one is

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,659
identifying new customers needs and

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,009
there's you know there's and that's

00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,500
different from what they say they want

00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:59,779
most of the time and you have to do some

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,460
work some research some cogitation and

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:04,100
trust your intuition there's all kinds

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,169
of things that go into that but like we

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,549
never would have these iPhones you know

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,289
it's the jobs are just trying to forget

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,389
to make a better way to listen to music

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:15,399
or take pictures or something

00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:18,440
so being being a little bit visionary

00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,549
about once versus needs but at the same

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,500
time if you just identifying

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,460
stakeholders you know being clear on

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,860
what the needs of your customers are are

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,080
is gonna make any content ever better

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,179
and then at the end of this day this is

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,230
where you can say here's my intent

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,230
here's what I want to do with this

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:40,700
content the strategy phase is where you

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:44,210
turn that into a plan for realizing that

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:49,669
content mission so taking those goals

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:52,190
that you assigned specific business

00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,600
goals to your content ever and then you

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,100
want to I would argue there's other ways

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,970
to do this but however you want to set

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,649
KPIs

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,679
does every order key performance

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,850
indicator as a KPI if you don't II just

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,970
google it it's a it's a great little

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,660
tool for kind of focusing your you're

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,320
after

00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,060
tracking efforts but if use of just the

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,140
few specific things to watch for to see

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,510
how you're progressing towards your

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,190
business goals then the classic that you

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,450
want to do is that you inventory what

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,040
you know and kind of have this vision

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,880
and you take a look at what you have if

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,280
you're building a site from scratch

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,600
that's nothing you know you can build it

00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,190
out from the get-go

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,080
but most of the time you'll have some

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,770
existing content that you're trying to

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,510
build out then you audit that content

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,500
against those goals in this KPIX like

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,840
how does it do it yeah are we achieving

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,280
or your dirty little secret of content

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,020
strategy everything happens in

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,970
spreadsheets so you have this audit

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,400
spreadsheet that you've done and then

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,750
use that columns basically with what it

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,880
is you're looking to to the measure

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,950
against let me look at the gaps between

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,690
what that are reveals which would go

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,520
away and then you come up with a plan

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,200
you know concise content strategy

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,320
there's a whole bunch of a sort of

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,090
Madlib looking formats out there for

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,040
crafting a content strategy kind of like

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,130
you see this in the business startup

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,900
world where they write anything that

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,810
there's sort of a number of cameras you

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,120
can do to get to that - articulating

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,620
your content strategy and then the

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,210
governance plan like I said before this

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,950
is like it used to manifest like this

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,450
like a row of blinders on the shelves

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,720
guessing it's probably going to be

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,400
digital these things but again remember

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,140
your content strategy is 90% about

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,590
people so the first thing in the

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,720
government stage you want to

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,730
owners and designers the people who have

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,130
the end Authority said if you hit an

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,990
obstacle or need a decision made you

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,450
know who these people are at a time I've

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,950
seen people get bogged down with like a

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,820
clarity right now but being around

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:47,580
really important people are is important

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,110
and part is that they're want to create

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,960
your guiding documents you have an idea

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,159
by the stage of you know what you know

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,659
why you're gonna do things you have a

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,640
policy translator how we're going to do

00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,760
it you Manson procedures manuals and

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,070
things you want to articulate your style

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
and this typically Memphis is like a

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,429
both automatical and their usage kind of

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,140
guide and there's tons of those like you

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,370
can just adopt like the AP style guide

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,140
or the Chicago Manual

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,270
but there's tons of online ones I like

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,659
18m and companies like that you can just

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,039
grab it for yourself and the other thing

00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,110
you want to have is like a voice in town

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,940
and this kind of goes with here any of

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,799
this is it's like MailChimp is the

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,240
classic example of that you know when

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,909
you're on MailChimp they just have this

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,230
distinct way of communicating that's and

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:32,159
that comes right out of their voices oh

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,590
man I really like the way I raised this

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,970
but I couldn't work with better language

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,890
but established compliance and this

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,020
basically just means getting the people

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,990
who agreed to what you're doing to do

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,730
what they said they were in you know and

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,770
so having a way to take yourself and

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,169
your team to task if things get stuck

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,330
and and just referring back to yourself

00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,970
and you're kind of documents you know

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,480
this this should be a hopefully emotion

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,250
free thing and then they want us gather

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,960
all your governance documents having

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:05,700
some place where people can refer to

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,440
them now we give them the fun stuff

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,750
deciding your content and like I said

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,720
before the designing content is it's

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,630
different from other kinds of design you

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,790
might have done

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,640
my information architecture relational

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,500
database design or things like that this

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,940
it starts with a messaging architecture

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,410
and this goes right back to that wire

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,870
that you did in your December things

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,030
like why are we doing this what's the

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,060
top level message again kind of like it

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,200
kind of tracks right back to that why

00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,900
exercise and then often you'll just have

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,440
a list of adjectives that is or about

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,930
like describe what you're doing but you

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,550
have a clear kind of framework to hang

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,640
all of your subsequent individual

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,540
message of messages on then you want to

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,610
figure out your distribution channels

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,620
this is over the web looks like they

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,350
published who I paid you for the whole

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,510
buncha together and then the the meat of

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,820
this stage of the design phases first

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,890
you design your content for your you

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,780
design the type of content you interview

00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,670
for your users and I would argue that

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,230
this is best done just in good

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,660
old-fashioned HTML it just creates a

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,670
semantically meaningful outlines of what

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,680
are you trying to get across then you

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,900
want to model your content to understand

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,090
the relationships between just like your

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,100
kind of my map kind of thing on a

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,900
butcher block paper on your kitchen

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,880
table it's usually good at under that

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,860
and then you want to structure your

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,330
content from multiple uses that in this

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,780
day as more to do this gets down in the

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,000
technical meat of it but you want to cut

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,960
another thing to care in the grain that

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,450
original governor your content strategy

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,180
says she's articulated the difference

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,470
between chunks and blogs like in content

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,080
strategy you always want to be thinking

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,390
about chunks not a lot of content but

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,720
you don't want to get too chunky then

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,140
you get off infinity

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,120
and things like this but but you I have

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,830
just the right size chunk so you want to

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,690
give that some thought to how you're

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,850
going to have the typical example would

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,190
be like this looks great in this two

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,169
column layout on my desktop but when how

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,580
does it how does it fold into a one

00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,650
column thing you want to structure

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:11,720
content so that that's that that and

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:14,809
similar activities oh the sorry model of

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,970
just modeling you know the relationships

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:19,900
between them so it's like a diagram of

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,010
how your contacts together like yeah

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,929
then you want to build your content

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,679
operation like if it might look like a

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:28,970
movie studio it might look like a radio

00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,470
station it might look like a newspaper

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,690
it might look like a multimedia that

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,530
crazy you think whatever the kind of

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,990
content you're creating you you have

00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:41,299
your operation and that's again because

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,950
we recorded word word camp I'm talking

00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,000
about WordPress and we're pretty far

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,890
down in here where we're talking about

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,919
this is where you pick your CMS at this

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:52,390
point you have an idea what you designs

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,980
and how it needs to be put out the world

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,650
coordinate oh I'm sorry

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,350
yeah there I go a content management

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,909
system and WordPress would be considered

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,370
a content management system there's

00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:06,350
dozens of other ones out there but yeah

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,600
we're Chris have a lot of mortgage here

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,140
that's why we my focus on here there's

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,000
others in the drupal and joomla there's

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,170
a whole bunch of other open source ones

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,460
proprietary ones things like quicksand

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,870
we workspace and things like that and

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,880
then you assign publishing roles again

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,820
mostly about people you figure out who's

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,750
gonna write the cop who's gonna assign

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:31,560
content make the content assignments

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:37,200
who's gonna write the subject matter is

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:39,270
that that accuracy final production on

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,800
it all that stuff you want to have a

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,620
fine publishing wall so you know who's

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,560
doing what and you want to stitch those

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,210
people together in workflows like

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,980
figuring out and this again a lot of

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,810
this stuff like ice you can design this

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,430
and plan this ahead of things but you'll

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,990
often find a lot of this stuff is pretty

00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,280
interactive you'll go back and go yeah

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,050
that's not working right we really need

00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,370
to subject matter expert to look at it

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,350
before we ever you know whatever your

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,660
considerations are but but these are

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,920
things you want to do and then at the

00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,930
end of this you'll have a Content

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,420
calendar you'll have you'll have a

00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,130
publishing plan you look say you know

00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:16,230
what we want to do now when are we going

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:18,420
to do it now let's publish and so in the

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,760
publishing world first the first thing

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,180
you might have if you're doing a

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,140
redesign or a project where you're

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,370
taking information out of the old

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,960
content may or another

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,730
CMS or even another WordPress

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,030
installation you'll have a Content

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,830
migration so that may be a consideration

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,810
you might have old content you can just

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,030
dump in and say that bad story I want

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:42,270
your content to start with but the main

00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,010
ongoing activity in publishing is it

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,560
will create your content artwork you

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,600
might be purposive you might you know

00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,790
however you source your content a lot of

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,010
different ways together you want to end

00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,780
up with your content then you produce it

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,040
you get it gussied up yourself and this

00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,990
gets back to that you know digital and

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,330
flex nature of content you want to have

00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:04,570
it you know stitch together with maybe

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,310
tax harmonies or when you designed it a

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,710
whole bunch but you want to have your

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,270
production team make sure that you're

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,130
doing it right before it goes in there

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,990
and then you distribute it once it's in

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,000
there improved and ready to go you can

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,010
get it out to the world and it's really

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,290
not done until you promote it you know

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,170
that in this distracted and the way

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,940
SeaWorld your job isn't done when you

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,010
get published it just started I hit

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,900
publish you get it's like if you build

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,460
it they will come in never been true and

00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,950
it's never the less true than it is

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,250
right now you've got a so I would argue

00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:39,400
that it's incumbent on you to promote

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,650
you as a steward of your content and

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,700
that may mean back to the stakeholder

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,130
thing making sure you have a good

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,900
relationship with a social media team or

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,670
whoever demanded you social media for

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,620
you to make sure it's out there or your

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,270
email alert if a different group does

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,670
the email marketing stuff Jen you have

00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:57,310
just making sure that your word is out

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,560
about your content and I wasn't been

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,900
going way back want to make sure you've

00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,480
done everything the optimized for SEO in

00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,710
every stage of the game that's one of

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,870
those things that should be baked in any

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,040
project accessibility or you know as you

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,640
know should be the two things that you

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,050
baked in from the start in any project

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,520
and then you need to manage the whole

00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,669
enterprise you want to look at your

00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,350
content performance

00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,889
how's it doing against those KPIs that

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,570
you said there's also like a qualitative

00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:25,669
element to a lot of content publishing

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,200
that can be difficult to communicate

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,389
like with people who are writing checks

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,759
for puppets and things like that but you

00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,529
want to have you want to be aware if

00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,210
they're example things like SEO and

00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:36,859
content marketing a really long place

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,259
and it's hard to measure you can't

00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:41,239
measure click to click a relationship

00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:42,919
between the content you create and the

00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,970
impact it has on your business so you

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:45,830
want to be aware that there's both

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,139
quantitative and qualitative things to

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,730
know to evaluate then you want to review

00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,169
those results and report to your

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,970
stakeholders and this is where those

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,100
awkward conversations are not awkward it

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,200
just that you know conversations about

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,340
ROI will come up because that's

00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,749
something that comes up over and over

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,389
again there's these two competing things

00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:05,289
I see all the time type system budgeters

00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:07,759
over here and SEO and content marketing

00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,679
experts over here saying you need to be

00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,450
doing 10 times as much as you do right

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,789
now if you want to have any impact I'm

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,080
like how do you reconcile it's like you

00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:17,139
know if you guys have secrets about how

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,019
to reconcile those I'm all ears

00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:23,419
and then these insights in these

00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:26,179
evaluations you'll want to revise remove

00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:28,129
maybe some content one of the you guys

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:29,659
have interviewed for my podcast is that

00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:32,600
Gerry McGovern does anybody know who he

00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:35,690
is he's a he's a real guest or nerdy

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,190
threw about he was a righty he

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,980
originally came to my attention about 10

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,929
years ago when I was new on for a CEO

00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,120
we talked about customer care routine

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,220
how focuses on key task accomplishment

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,549
so he works with like big fortune 500

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,410
literally fortune 50 companies and any

00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,570
other a lot of times his work resulted

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:55,990
in removing like as much as 90% of the

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,630
content off site so so that's one of the

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,730
outcomes that can come from this country

00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:03,010
and then ultimately you know this whole

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:08,230
thing is a big cycle you may need to

00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:09,910
come back now I want to speak this

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,440
together a little bit differently you

00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,900
know there's a list it's just like blah

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,210
blah blah you know so let me put

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,790
together in a different way if you take

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,890
the discovery strategy and government

00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,150
stages that's sort of your new strategy

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,880
phase that's where you're figuring

00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,220
everything out what you're going to do

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,630
the design build and publish thing is

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,160
that's where the implementation that's

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,260
where it all rubber hits the road you're

00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,690
actually doing stuff you're acting on on

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,669
your plan and that's the implementation

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,290
phase and then the management that's

00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:39,790
just your ongoing administration like

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,010
you know how we run things in your

00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,870
business or with your clients or how you

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,580
manage that but once you've got it

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:48,490
mapped out like this you see that like

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:51,850
the first few parts of each of those

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,650
four stages are typically more like

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,320
projects like one-off things that you'll

00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,549
do here and there where is the second

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,830
stuff the governance of publishing

00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:02,440
that's just your ongoing kind of

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,480
day-to-day operation and overtime that

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,220
governance stuff kind of shifts into the

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,020
background just a little bit it's just

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,340
something you refer to and mostly what

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,300
you're doing is running a publishing

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,889
operation and so any of that so this is

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,210
comes right back to me trying to get

00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:21,030
away from publishing I'm like oh crap

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:23,710
I'm right back in it so any now so

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,889
that's does that model make sense does

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,289
it

00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,700
yeah does that help you

00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:29,929
look at this is like and there's a lot

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,369
going on here all the people who've

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,159
written about to this point that's been

00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,740
sort of like I know if I had a job doing

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,020
this I know how to do it but if I didn't

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,849
know how to do it how that every day get

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,319
it accomplished right anyway that's my

00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:44,629
intent of this whole project is though

00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:46,879
hopefully help you guys incorporate

00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,990
content strategy and so that's that gets

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,569
into the next thing I want to talk about

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:53,599
is the application of this like that

00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:56,089
that checklist that I created as a DIY

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
content strategy calm and like I said

00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,750
you just go grab that du would be one

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:10,579
with this kind of intervention with your

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:12,529
the way you operate and everybody has I

00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:16,160
know from talking to him I'm like he's

00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:18,260
like yeah but I think you would have

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,500
some appreciation for that this strike

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,690
you know like looking at it this way and

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,770
Sonia you can just grab that checklist

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,500
do what you want but they're kind of

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,569
incorporated into your things I'm person

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,579
that you can and like I said you can

00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:33,980
take that checklist and if you're a

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:36,829
small business person there's no time no

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,359
money no budget and just but you know

00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,859
you just kind of feeling you need to be

00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:42,529
doing the better stewardship with your

00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,089
content you can sit down at your dining

00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:46,819
room table with two hours three four

00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:48,289
hours and come up with a sketch you know

00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:50,329
just like a cocktail napkin sketch of

00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:51,859
your content strategy kind of consider

00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,270
each of those considerations each of

00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,920
those

00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,080
that I set out you know I have to go

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,130
into all the detail and a lot of times

00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,140
you realize how many I've thought about

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,610
then I know my values you know my why

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,230
and all that kind of stuff you can

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,360
there's a lot of work that they already

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,010
have been done but any case even just

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,460
giving a few hours of attention to it

00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:12,270
being kind of strategy I'm working right

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,640
now on a work look you know that I'll

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,140
probably sell the folks is like like

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,320
sort of a I don't exactly have a

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:23,020
manifest but because I need to produce I

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,650
can listen people first but which kind

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,360
of expected this

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,400
this whole idea of DIY content

00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,340
strategies only three months old in my

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,610
mind so apologies it's not completely

00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,410
flush yeah but but because you can in

00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,510
any of your welcome just take those

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,750
steps and create a workbook that you can

00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,190
hand your kalaiy answer if you want to

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,870
jump on board I think we're entering my

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,150
kind of golden age of content strategy

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,820
the more I talk to I you know like I

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,650
mention I joined the content strategy

00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,900
organizing team as I talk to people in

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:54,910
that world and just content people in

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,800
general there's this sort of growing

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,240
sense of excitement and enthusiasm about

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,530
the field of the discipline people are

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,060
actually getting budgets they were

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,770
getting higher there's content

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,900
strategists appearing all over the place

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,790
not always called that by the way like

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,610
it Google they are role called UX

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,930
writers which looks exactly like the job

00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:14,410
description for any Content strategist

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:16,030
at Facebook so so anyhow there's kind of

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,740
a and you can also apply it as a

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,860
consultant that's probably the main way

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,060
that happens in this world so you could

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,280
you know hang your shingle as a

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,810
consultant in and do this or

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,200
partnerships I've talked to a ton of

00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,940
agency people this is my fourth campus

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,050
fall and where I've talked about this

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,270
and every

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,850
and ended up talking to agencies were

00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,620
like yeah we could you know any there

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,300
may be opportunities there for me or

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,400
other people who are actually content

00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,680
strategy to partner with agencies and

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,410
help them incorporate like a content

00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,940
strategy practice inside their agency or

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,810
just even in your development into mine

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,800
practice however however you articulated

00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,800
one last thing I want to talk about

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:04,360
listening to old white people like me

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,640
you can help us native speaker training

00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,380
University outreach me that's one of the

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,570
things I do in WordPress community work

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,030
with Jill binder up in Vancouver and

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:14,890
we're doing work so anybody in here

00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:18,040
organized weird cancer he does

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,510
I see wouldn't be dumb organizer yeah so

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,130
anybody who organizes the elsewhere

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,840
cancer any kind of event we've the other

00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,510
people together we've got a bunch of

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,760
resources about how to encourage just

00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,500
you know get more voices into the into

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,600
the community just go to the first

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,250
speakers dialing phone and like I said

00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,150
there's more information about DIY

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,150
content strategy

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,749
[Applause]

00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,110
[Music]

00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,000
[Music]

00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,169
[Music]

00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,210
[Music]

00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,960
don't exactly know how to phrase this

00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:13,420
but I really like your methodology seems

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,000
to play well with slightly larger

00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,590
companies that can have a management

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,960
I don't know if there are any other

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,550
solopreneurs in the room but as I've

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,230
been watching the world of content over

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,170
the past five years I realized we're

00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,670
going under because there are so many

00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,980
opportunities to be strategic and get

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,540
your message out but we also have a job

00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,000
to do and we're the only one who's doing

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,790
it so is there a way that you would have

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,040
dot adapt your methodology with

00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,020
micro-businesses absolute Petra's top

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,030
that's the very first thing on my agenda

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,590
because all my friends are like massage

00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,690
therapist it's like a therapist and

00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,550
independent web developers and that's

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,760
the very first reason and that's sort of

00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:54,010
been my from the get-go

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,360
I've always hung out with the guys that

00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,980
have always known all my friends have

00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,380
always been the little guys and so

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,230
figuring out how to funnel those

00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,460
practices into actionable that's the

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,860
whole point that this checklist is the

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,950
first draft and like I said the first

00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,080
product I'm creating the first

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:13,270
manifestation of this in sort of an

00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,880
actionable way will be exactly addressed

00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:19,840
to that small subtle renard celebrators

00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,300
independent professionals and I think

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,010
you can hit each of those you think it's

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,390
important to take off each of those

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:30,760
activities but you don't need a staff of

00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,050
12 you're not going to have what we X

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,330
researcher is helping you on your

00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,130
content right well if I was coaching

00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,760
some what I

00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:40,830
based on experience add a category to

00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,230
your list called take away half of it

00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,330
because we end up with no time and

00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,890
feeling so a super stretch because with

00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:49,290
all the things that we could do are

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,360
marvelous but somebody has to speak

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,560
reality to this so I push back a little

00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,880
bit on this because I think each of

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,560
those things I thought a lot about this

00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,210
list before I created it I think it's

00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,190
important at least consider you to those

00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,290
items on there it might be a five minute

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,840
dismissal of it to say now I know enough

00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:06,180
about that or you know it is a

00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,640
overstressed solopreneur you know next

00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,860
to the limit I got no time for that but

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,480
I thought I've given it a microsecond of

00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,860
thought so I would argue that you still

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,360
want to consider those things but you're

00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,370
absolutely right and that's like I said

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,710
that's my first project is to get this

00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,120
down to like what's the kind of MVP

00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,780
Minimum Viable Product you know the

00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:36,330
startup

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:37,740
what's the Minimum Viable it's not

00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,930
really a question as much as a

00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,720
suggestion with what you're doing as

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,210
you're doing this I would say it would

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,760
be really nice and we could look at your

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,800
site and see a list of people who know

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:57,360
how to do your methodology that we could

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:59,370
contract with okay you're making a work

00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,650
I'm saying down the road you're making

00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,390
work book it would be a really good one

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,100
we have how much in yeah and that's

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,720
something that is anything you grab this

00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,050
and run with it let me know I'll promote

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,450
you all over the place

00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,580
in my talks and stuff absolutely I love

00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,170
that idea and that kind of goes back I

00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,830
hope you're all on bridges I came out

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,270
this morning

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,340
this is a community you know that's my

00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,770
intent but this is like I just made some

00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,910
discoveries sharing it now and I want to

00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,710
solve the connect with one another

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:34,960
connect the dots figure out better ways

00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:36,640
to do and I have whatever next thing we

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,040
don't think I didn't see on there I work

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,590
both counts as a micro entrepreneur and

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,900
I also work with the team at my day job

00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:47,470
and you don't have anything about

00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,780
planning for Sun setting or how you get

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:58,750
the content off and I think that's

00:43:49,780 --> 00:44:00,340
really because and that's something to

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,290
be right if you're content creator can

00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,900
be so hard to let go there's this saying

00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:07,180
and editorial where kill your darlings

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,980
you know it's like that fingers like a

00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,570
novelist as this beautiful turns of

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,270
phrase because then that making you do

00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,490
this story you know and that's a that is

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,600
every but what you're the same like yeah

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,780
if it doesn't it's not helping your

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,780
customers

00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:44,680
we will now execute these I think Gerry

00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:48,719
McGovern we gladly accept that label

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,719
Twiggy does the content executioner

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:55,709

00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:55,709
