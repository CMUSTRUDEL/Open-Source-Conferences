Title: Kimberly Gauthier: 7 Steps to Becoming a Full Time Blogger
Publication date: 2020-04-15
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	One of my first blogs was named “Blogging in my Pajamas,” because I wanted to build a blog into a fulltime job. Too many blogs about blogging combined with my general lack of knowledge squashed that dream. Today, 7 years later, I am months away from turning my passion into a full-time business. Last year, I began making changes to my blogging routine that tripled my income, increased my traffic, and landed me on page one of Google for the competitive keyword “Raw Dog Food.”
Join me at WordCamp to learn the steps I took that are leading me to the day when I will be blogging from home, surrounded by my dogs.
