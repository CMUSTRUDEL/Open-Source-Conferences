Title: Kimberly Gauthier: 7 Steps to Becoming a Full Time Blogger
Publication date: 2020-04-15
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	One of my first blogs was named “Blogging in my Pajamas,” because I wanted to build a blog into a fulltime job. Too many blogs about blogging combined with my general lack of knowledge squashed that dream. Today, 7 years later, I am months away from turning my passion into a full-time business. Last year, I began making changes to my blogging routine that tripled my income, increased my traffic, and landed me on page one of Google for the competitive keyword “Raw Dog Food.”
Join me at WordCamp to learn the steps I took that are leading me to the day when I will be blogging from home, surrounded by my dogs.

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,020
and what I want to do this straight from

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,550
the start and let you guys help this is

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,410
not going to be a session that you're

00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,410
going to walk out of here is ready to go

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:35,120
but what I do want to say is that

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,890
there's no matter what works for me may

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,710
work for you and may not work for you

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,410
I'm going to tell you what to do once

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,020
you start feeling like you're ready to

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,640
go full-time and this could be a year

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,410
from now or two years now I honestly

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,180
wish I will started doing these these

00:01:48,410 --> 00:02:27,430
years ago because then I would be

00:01:50,180 --> 00:02:31,400
prepared today so this is what I going

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,530
this is the purpose of each Joey is to

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,750
tell a happy story and I was going to

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,520
tell about how every litter mates and

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,209
they're so happy and healthy and bla bla

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,550
bla bla bla mostly people were tired of

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,260
me talking about my puppies if the two

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,120
years that were puppies anymore and

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,070
people are like we were tired of looking

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,920
at pictures we're tired of hearing sweet

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,200
videos a bit barking so I figure I'll

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,550
have a blog and I will just talk about

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,820
it there get your later after the years

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:04,190
of my dog stay in sync in going in and

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,280
out his best office I was introduced to

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,660
Rafi basically yes feeding my dog raw

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,630
meat that's a real basic explanation

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:17,480
that's what I see and I switched my dog

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,850
to a raw food diet within two weeks most

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,640
of his health issues banished and I was

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,950
just like I continued burning and over

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,410
that next year it was so hard to figure

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,530
out where healthy people were mean and

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,480
judgmental and I figured I was going to

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,820
hurt them learning about Rob Feenie I've

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
met other people would be two plus one

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,930
of my followers and hey you ain't

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,030
talking about that we're all feeling

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,140
that you're doing and I decided you know

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,720
what that's what I'm going to do with my

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,550
blog I switched it to a Roth blog what I

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,800
didn't realize was that I was going to

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,660
be only people on the planet writing

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,630
about Roth evenings so if I fell into a

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,750
ditch that turned into a big deal I got

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,240
very lucky so I always tell people if

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,230
you want to turn your blog into

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,330
something that will support you

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,240
full-time you've got a narrow your focus

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,430
you can't be a fashion blogger you need

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,900
to narrow that focus into an audience

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,850
and you know that you're going to get

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,860
that particular audience coming back to

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,800
your blog over and over again and you're

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,110
not competing with all the huge fashion

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,030
blogs out there so when I was just a

00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,940
pack Walker I was competing with

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,710
thousands and thousands of blogs out

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,110
there not to mention Petco and Petsmart

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,850
and all of these sites as well but when

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,420
I narrowed it down are all feeding for

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,420
dogs

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,690
I've practically had zero competition so

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,850
I was able to dominate really quickly so

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,810
know that the money is in the list I

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,490
don't know if you guys have heard this

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,560
but I heard it all throughout my

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,480
blogging career the money is in the list

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
you got to start collecting those emails

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,240
and I was of the belief that I get so

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,500
tired of people emailing me I don't want

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,660
to be that person as spammy people

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,850
an email does this cover your blog those

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,890
that they want to read it that was wrong

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,840
I shouldn't been collecting email all

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,520
along I did it off and on here and there

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,140
but I didn't really have a purpose for

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,550
it I was just collecting you know and

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,660
not really emailing anyone because I

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,700
didn't know what to do with it

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,030
well guess what the money is in the list

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,550
I now have a marketing consultant that I

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,100
use that helps me set up my marketing

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,050
funds and I use my list to make money

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,500
it's very important they talked a little

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,660
bit about that later on and finally you

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,910
need to understand be able to analyze

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,980
your traffic that is so important it's

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,350
so easy to sit there and put the Google

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,850
Analytics on our site never go and look

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,890
at it and try to understand what's

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,080
coming what's happening what sites

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,460
peeler blog who people are visiting how

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,230
long they're staying on your site it may

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,730
not seem like a big deal you may be

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,919
intimidated because I don't really

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,840
understand it we gotta get over it it's

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,950
important and that's one of the things

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,220
that you're going to be able to use that

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,380
information to leverage your business so

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,510
that you are continually making money

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,200
and it's not just like a one-off being

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,820
here and there so that is the secret to

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,740
get to where I am today

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,270
now what we're going to talk about is

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,690
what I should have been doing all along

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,490
as well in this session I want you guys

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,110
alone for you to raise your hand and

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,550
answer a question I will repeat the

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,320
question so we can make sure we get it

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,820
on the rewards or if you go to that

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,520
microphone and ask a question and I'm

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,860
going to try and make this quick so that

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,710
we can have a question and answer

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,900

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,950
session

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,950
those were my slides that I disturb you

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:49,150
so oprah winfrey is my idol so I have to

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,750
something about her in here so the first

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,150
thing you want to create a plan I'm

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,590
going to let that sit there I'm actually

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,030
not going to read that to you as you

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:06,070
guys can read on your own but what I am

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:08,350
going to tell you is that when I started

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,180
realizing that I might be able to do

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,970
this full-time I knew that I needed to

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,170
create a plan because I'm partner yo he

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,120
is my best friend and he was not

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,520
comfortable with me saying hey I'm gonna

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,170
block full-time I'm done quitting my job

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,600
tomorrow because he was just sort of

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,640
like okay so what about benefits what

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,650
about the retirement plan what if

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,030
something goes wrong and those are the

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,710
things that I didn't even think about I

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,770
was so excited about the fact that I was

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,780
finally making money so what I did is I

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,280
had to step back to the side well how

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,880
much money am I going to need to replace

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,070
my day job and that includes not only

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,050
taxes but also benefits and then my 401

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,570
K I'm going to have to take all that on

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,280
for myself and then I'm going to need

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,560
anything I've got all that dollar amount

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,700
but at least get a little bit more than

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,410
that because I wouldn't be able to put

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,840
away money for say means I want to be

00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,700
able to have a little nest egg I wanted

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,370
to start saving money that we prepare

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,560
for that so that's what I did I looked

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,570
at the calendar I chose a date on the

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,090
calendar the date is actually probably

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,130
like in a week or so that date has now

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,650
since we moved out another six months

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,660
good I'm not quite ready yet but I have

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,590
a date on the calendar

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,300
it's June 30 of 2019 and what I'm going

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,510
to do between now and then or what I

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,400
have been doing is paying off debt so

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm not going to pay off the house I'm

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,630
not that well but I'm going to pay off

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,669
as much debt as possible and I'm also

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,580
going to save up six months worth of

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,610
income so that if anything goes weird or

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,680
lucky I have an estate I also need to

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,080
spend this next six months talking to

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,140
someone about an investment account I

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,430
need to get the benefits down I'm not

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,870
sure if I'm going to be able to get the

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,930
benefits down so I might have to learn a

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,040
part-time job just to have business but

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,620
those are the type of things that I'm

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,740
figuring around right now so if you are

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,210
thinking of using a blog as your

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,580
full-time income

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,990
start making a plan now start really

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,090
thinking these ways because you do not

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,190
want to be in a place where you didn't

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,860
think about this and then all of a

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,560
sudden you're hit with a backpack to get

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,470
just basic benefits is gonna cost you

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,900
success $700 a month and those are

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,740
really great benefits and so those are

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,610
the type of things you know what to be

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:26,580
shocked about that know your work too

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,130
often I get emails from bloggers who are

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,000
telling me that oh my gosh

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,650
someone's gonna pay me to do name it and

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,750
they tell me they're so excited they're

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,540
maybe $50 and it's just sort of like

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,340
what exactly is $50 going to cover in

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,910
your life if you are doing this

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,240
full-time

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:51,300
what does that $50 that cover for me it

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:53,190
will cover 1/3 of myself it's nothing so

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,800
know your work actually take the time

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,720
and the understand how much are bloggers

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,220
in your niche getting paid if you don't

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,990
know bloggers who are open up about

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,680
their finances that they you can ask I

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,680
mean I personally

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,709
so if my friends ask me I'll tell them

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,450
but if a stranger comes and ask me how

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,750
much I get paid blogging I'm probably

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,390
going to him it hot enough but you know

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,190
why so many trusts that can tell you how

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,680
much there may be if you can't find that

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,820
person reach out to brands and see how

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,770
much they're willing to pay

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,880
find someone you know where you can

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,380
start learning these things because

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,080
you're going to need to use that to

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,149
figure out what your hourly rate is on

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,279
the other side figure out what your our

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,350
hourly rate is look at all the bills

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,149
that you have to cover and then boil

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,180
that down to how much do you need to be

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:41,310
an hour or a day or a week or a month to

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,570
cover all those bills and then meet in

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:47,820
the middle so you can figure out how

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:51,209
much you need to charge so one of the

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,560
things would be back I'm just noticing a

00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,500
lot of loggers gaming is that they're

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,940
taking things for free there except next

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,370
thing you know well I'm going to do this

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,970
work for exposure that's a lie and there

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,910
is no exposure or they're basically

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,040
billing 50 percent of what they're worth

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,290
one thing I found is that and I say oh

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,810
this is my charge 300 for that

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,240
if but bran tells me okay where do I pay

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,760
that I know I just shorted myself so the

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,160
next time I'm gonna charge $600 for it

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,140
and believe it or not I know it's scary

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
and I'm going to say something to the

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,279
ladies of the audience sometimes weed

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,380
tends to be like oh I don't want to make

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,200
someone mad

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,120
you know you set your rates you do not

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,980
let the stranger who doesn't know

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,490
anything about your business that your

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,490
race

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,589
I finally recognize it I get over

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,960
200,000 people just being my blog in a

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,690
month I haven't worked hard over the

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,430
past 15 years to build an audience than

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,890
people ever were 20,000 likes on

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,300
Facebook and to me that's nothing I mean

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,250
I should I feel like I should have over

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,880
50,000 likes because I'm awesome like

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,710
that but that's something that I work

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,440
for I am NOT going to allow a stranger

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,779
to knock on my door and ask me to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,970
promote their products to my audience

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,010
that I worked hard to build for 50

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,960
dollars or for $300

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,700
I'm the charge than an insane amount of

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,150
money and if they don't want to pay for

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,380
it that they can go I'm okay with that

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,080
but I'm not going to allow some of the

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,870
Sam on my shoulders and access my

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,450
audience for free of her cheap and

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,890
that's hard to get used to but it gotta

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,450
start doing it because if this is going

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,029
to be your full-time business if this is

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,770
how you pay bills you can't afford to be

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:36,600
giving away your time or your services

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:39,930
for free over cheap diversify your

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,550
income a few months ago I woke up I

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,310
think it was a Saturday or Sunday

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,240
morning and I have a shop of my life

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,790
shot

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,410
I don't often have meltdowns anymore I

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,240
just have always had a meltdown in life

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,680
I went to my blog and all of sudden I

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,100
got the white him to death I'd have a

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,529
meltdown I mean if something didn't work

00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,880
I felt like if I could figure something

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,040
out I had enough

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,320
by the hand of my computer everything

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,000
was hard how am i work I want to be the

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,800
students long evening it's frustrating

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,270
but then I figured everything out

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,240
everything clicked and the kind of color

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,820
dampener going tonight but a couple

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,310
months ago I had complete utter I was

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,270
laying on the floor like oh my god this

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,100
sucks

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,890
type of meltdown and the reason why is

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,540
that I got an email from amazon.com

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,980
telling me hey guess what we're kicking

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,590
you out of this way of programming if

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:37,620
you're not following the rules oh okay

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:42,060
Amazon affiliate that is enough a year

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,610
two thousand dollars that I just lost

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,530
and not only that with Amazon takes you

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,830
out of the program because they paid you

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,960
like what 30 to 60 days later all the

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,810
money that I have a cruise gone I lost

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,420
over three thousand dollars and yeah

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:05,850
damn right that's exactly it I was works

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:11,190
I was screaming yes I actually did break

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:13,140
the rules but I got I'll tell you when

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,640
you go to Amazon if you have a product

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,980
that you're promoting you cannot do

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,930
screenshots of the products on Amazon

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,970
why because they don't always load the

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,350
images so you can't take them other

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,080
brands images and put them on your

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,090
website that is a no Duff type of

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,100
mistake that I made I was stupid

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,960
another thing you can't do is you can't

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,340
screenshot review so if you're trying to

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,800
convince your followers that hey

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,300
everyone loves this you just gotta tell

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
them everyone loves it go over to Amazon

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,870
and look at you cannot screenshot

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,270
reviews they have certain ways in which

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,730
you can put images on your website I

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,620
just don't like the way it looks so I

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,900
was just doing a screenshot it was a

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,279
stupid stupid

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,610
rookie mistake I should have known

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,320
better but in their email he said hey we

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,790
eat melt you three weeks ago told him to

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,279
give this fixes and she didn't fix it

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,250
we're kicking you out I never got that

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,990
email and so I called them said I never

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,760
got an email and they are like well

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,710
let's look into this then I got an email

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,020
probably a couple days later is four

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,500
days total where they said sorry about

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,440
that

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,910
we reinstated you and I fixed everything

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,410
that they thought and then it had a

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,910
great conversation with the Amazon

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,800
affiliate people which I thought were

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,110
impossible to reach they were awesome

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,080
and got everything fix on my site and

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,350
now everything's good but from that

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,060
lesson I learned one when you join an

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,860
affiliate program you gotta bring those

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,150
documents and if you don't understand it

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,320
if you don't feel like reading it can

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,330
unify so I'm going to get on the phone

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,190
and have them explain it to you and so

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,620
now whenever I joined a new affiliate

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,500
program I asked them about one link

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,140
Lizzie you can't close leaks or Amazon

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,790
I've never done that but that's a lie I

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,550
did it years ago but someone warned me

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,290
about it so I stopped doing that so what

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,200
I mean by the link loading is that if

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,670
there is a cookie if there is a product

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,350
that I promote all the time it's just

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,160
easier for me to say keep the tail

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,380
wagging comm backslash product I can't

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,589
do that with an affiliate program they

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,820
want to be as transparent as possible

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:14,510
another thing that you can't do is you

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,220
can't use your mailing list with some of

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,010
the affiliate programs to promote

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,990
affiliate links so if you join MailChimp

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,880
if you join any Weber make sure you

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,200
understand what you can use that Mellon

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,600
list for what you can't use it for

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,000
there's just a lot of rules and so I

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,209
learned from that understand the rules I

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,370
got no money bathroom so I was happy but

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:38,060
I learned that I don't want to be

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:40,640
without a day job and find out this one

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,089
part of my income drops away and it's

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,279
gone

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,319
because I was told that if you kids on

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,420
the bad side of Amazon you were done

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,980
there was no recourse there is a

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,329
recourse you just got to be lucky enough

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,930
to get someone on the phone and I got

00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:58,639
lucky I meant to do that this is how I

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,050
monetize my blog I have affiliate

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,579
marketing and forget it's guys who don't

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,170
know that just basically means that you

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,179
buy something through a link on my site

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,939
I might get a commission for it

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,949
I have display advertising a lot of

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,539
people don't want to do display

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,980
advertising because they don't want

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,970
people to come to their site we'd be

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,880
inundated with ads I got over that that

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,220
was a big moneymaker and 80% of my

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,140
traffic is organic traffic is people are

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,010
used to going the sites with ads on them

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,570
it's okay I have sponsored posts and

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,640
sponsorships yes they are different

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,890
sponsored posts is a one-time post at

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,220
least on my blog is a sponsorship is

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,529
over a period of time I will not allow

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,809
anyone to sign up for sponsorship on my

00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,789
blog for less than six months it's just

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,760
not worth my time so it's six months for

00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:50,240
a twelve month or it's nothing at all I

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,980
do I create products right here at book

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm writing my second book right now

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,049
this was crazy easy to write it started

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,940
out as a series of blog post then I

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:01,610
downloaded it into a Word document

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,260
clean it up add some chapters and then

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,480
published it on Amazon

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,760
it took me about six months to do this

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,640
you know just off and on working on it

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,700
then I also offer a service you can

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,740
offer consulting coaching speaking I do

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,390
workshops on graffiti I do some of the

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,770
marysville and some of them like a lot

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,080
of dog trainers will have me come out

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,240
and speak to their clients about feeding

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,970
their dogs or raw food diet I'm also

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,440
going to start offering recipe cards

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,179
that are completely balanced the best

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:35,179
concerns with my readers is how to do

00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:38,809
that Fitz understand how your income

00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,549
fluctuates so there are people who do

00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:43,340
their business on calendar year that

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:45,679
makes sense to me then they're the

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,380
people who do it on a fiscal year so

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,690
it's July to June and what I've learned

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,400
this year is they have a lot of pet

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,130
business is do there's different

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,190
concepts here so in about August

00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,480
September everyone stops paying for

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,980
advertising because they're trying to

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,340
figure out what they're going to do and

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:09,679
my income drops drastically because of

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:11,630
that invite graphically about I lost

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,559
about a thousand fifteen hundred dollars

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:18,710
a month on advertising so early in the

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,870
year but if I were working this full

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,860
time and not prepared for it it would

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,160
have freaked the hell out of me

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:29,030
especially after living Amazon so take

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,760
the median and into your traffic over a

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,280
12-month period get to know the Google

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,549
out of the rhythm changes what I found

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:40,460
is that on August 1st Google did a medic

00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:43,010
update which impacted all my Health's

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,900
blogs and websites and not just all

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,730
health loss websites but those that

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,649
floated

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:52,690
and my traffic I lost 2,000 HP per month

00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:55,480
compared to a lot of the bigger sites

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,490
out there it's not a big deal but that

00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,669
is another reason why my income dropped

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,380
is because I lost I went from making two

00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,610
hundred dollars a day and advertising to

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,779
making a hundred dollars a day in

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,159
advertising it's a huge huge difference

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,289
pay attention to your how your income

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,779
grows and falls

00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:16,149
that way you can cover it you can save

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,639
money in the high ones you can be a

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,950
little frugal in the little nuts or you

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:22,690
can make plans for advertising campaigns

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,950
during those little bumps those are the

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,549
kind of things you want to keep thinking

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,559
about that right there just shows you

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:33,580
the little drop it over all my traffic

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:36,100
is pretty ok and then that below is just

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,789
showing you that close to 80% of my

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,409
traffic is organic traffic just people

00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,440
who are unwilling something and they

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:47,169
come across my site and so knowing these

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,190
things helps me plan for how I'm going

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:55,419
to schedule campaigns how I'm going to

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,919
monetize all of that so you can track

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,070
your income using a spreadsheet I

00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,750
started out that way I use big machines

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,549
but I have since gone in QuickBooks

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,769
which is a much easier way to do it

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,840
because now in the year is this in my

00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:11,200
QuickBooks off to my CPA you can do my

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,320
taxes take the time to learn why your

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,710
income increase

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
decreases so increases are great and I

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,639
love them but I need to know why that

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,769
happened so I can redo it I can do it

00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:23,210
again if my increase drops I need to

00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:25,789
understand why that happened so I can

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,730
avoid that in the future when my income

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,590
decrease in August in 12 September as I

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,000
saw it I was on the phone with people

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,970
trying to understand what was happening

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,370
since I work with an advertising company

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,769
and they have a vested interest in my

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,539
traffic they were on top of it as well

00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,240
but as far as they were concerned I was

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:48,169
doing great but I found out later about

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,360
the kinetic update if you're not

00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:53,179
confident with SEO you need to work with

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,159
someone I love SEO I think it's fun but

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:58,429
I don't know everything about SEO but

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,500
SEO is so very important you do not want

00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,909
to do this and get involved in this and

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,340
quit your job and be working full time

00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:08,360
and not understand why your blog does

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,799
what it does and then finally and this

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,899
is not finally I'm just saying that

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:18,259
because I say that all the time so this

00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:20,600
is how my blog I go crazy and keep in

00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,370
mind I want a full-time job still but

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,990
this is it's so important to take

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,210
advantage of all the things that are out

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,220
there it's easy to sit there and just

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,720
okay I'm just going to write a blog post

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,480
on the publisher for the sharing on

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,009
Facebook but I also take my blog posts

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,019
and I turned them into videos there are

00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:37,460
programs that allow you to easily do

00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,669
that there are programs that will follow

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,649
your RSS feed and allow you and it will

00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:44,990
import your content and help you get

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,639
started on a video so that then you can

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,070
then edit it up and then upload into

00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:52,289
base

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:54,750
uploaded to YouTube you can create

00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,250
graphics I actually think it's denied

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm going to tell you about it later but

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,269
if I hire a graphic art as a student as

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,639
an intern it helped me create graphics

00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:04,590
when I say if there's all these

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,570
wonderful wonderful things that you can

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,419
do but you've got to promote promote

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:12,259
promote I'm going to give you one trick

00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,419
tip that I did not add on the slides a

00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:17,909
spiteful missing letter so missing but

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,769
Leonard without Pulaski le TT are

00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:21,179
missing Leonard will just basically

00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:25,830
import your RSS feed

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:27,870
it sets up chairs for a 365 day period

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,419
so it's not every day but I think it's

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,580
like six to nine chairs that is going to

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,529
be over in here and it makes it so easy

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,690
to go in and schedule out their shares

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:39,120
and boom that's one less thing that you

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,590
have to do it's super easy to do and if

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
you're lucky you can find someone to do

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,799
it for you please let me know

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,299
I have knocked out anyone that knows how

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:50,639
to use with missing letter oops

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,620
treat your blog like a business this is

00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:55,019
a big mistake that I see so many

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,419
bloggers making where I will go to

00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:01,620
events and bloggers are dressed like

00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:04,019
they are tourists in Florida and no one

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,570
will take you seriously each summer I go

00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,389
to my Tracy Ocasio Smith in Las Vegas

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,100
and how do you think that oh my gosh

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:14,460
you're gonna be a loss he is for a week

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:18,210
that's going to be fun yeah for that

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,159
trip I actually go shopping for the trip

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,789
but I mostly go shopping because that's

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,130
fun and then I plan out my clothes for

00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:29,010
the entire event because I have

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,620
with grams have events to go to I all I

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,710
fashion it was on the news when I was in

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:38,370
Vegas this past year so I have a very

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,500
particular outfit and I address based in

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,840
corporate casual I would call it I do

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,360
not go to Vegas wearing I always went

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,400
dark jeans because dark teams even look

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,410
nicer than like jeans and everywhere

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,289
ripped jeans but the reason why is

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,419
because I am walking around I'm actually

00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:56,429
just supposed to be there to a report on

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,350
super suit I'm not really there to have

00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,600
people say hey I want to hire you to

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,490
promote my products but that does happen

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,960
and the reason why it does happen is

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,789
because I look like a person who knows

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,400
what I'm doing if I walked around

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:10,470
superzoom wearing ripped jeans and a

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,679
t-shirt was a big of kitty on it and

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,799
maybe a backwards baseball cap no one is

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,059
going to trust me with their money I

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,400
need to look like someone that is

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:25,230
trustworthy that's the business person

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,850
so treat your blog like a business so I

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,580
have a whole office

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:35,909
we are still practicing on understanding

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:38,039
what office hours my boyfriend when day

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,289
I was on the phone with a brand and he

00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,820
came to me and said hey I need your help

00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:51,600
real quick I'm like do you really need

my help yes I go outside and he's like

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,999
that money out of get started understand

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,710
I am sitting at this desk I'm at work

00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:06,639
and he will say that you were in your

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,639
pajamas a teddy bear

00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:12,950
you cannot interrupt me so get a whole

00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:17,299
opposite half everyone understand these

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,940
are workouts you know make sure you set

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,499
aside any time it's easy to get really

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,970
super stoked and do all of this

00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:24,619
especially that we've been like were

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,389
camp I'm gonna do all these things I'm

00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,399
going to do it and then all of a sudden

00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:30,799
you're completely another overly well

00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,200
and burned out do not allow yourself to

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,820
do that treat it like have a weekend I

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,950
sometimes have a date or two and it's

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,889
hard I feel guilty because I keep doing

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,960
stuff but I will not touch my blog I

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:44,749
allow myself to just watch Real

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,830
Housewives all the cities are on right

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:50,389
now except for New York it's so great it

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,919
maintained an editorial calendar I'm

00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:53,690
good to have that out for you but I am

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,460
old school I have to have a paper

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,200
calendar so I can look at the entire

00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,629
counter and make plans and what I'm

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,850
going to do it's so important to me to

00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:03,710
be able to keep organized and know every

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,450
single day what I need to do is the

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,090
reason why I have so much on my plate

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,769
right now that is easy to become

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,809
overwhelmed and then before you know it

00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:12,440
two weeks have gone by and you haven't

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:15,679
done anything

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,539
I have Black Friday and Cyber Monday are

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,610
coming up I have to be planned for that

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:23,480
and so that's what I did yesterday at

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,159
the day and I plan for Black Friday and

00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,340
Cyber Monday by creating a new marketing

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,919
file you need to track your income and

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,749
expenses you need to hire a CPA unless

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,509
you're an accountant I'm an accountant I

00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:36,830
will do my taxes I don't know how to do

00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,629
this this tactic I know how to do

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,240
personal taxes but my blog is not a

00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:43,399
person so I have a CPA I have an

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,970
attorney as well my blog name was

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,929
trademarked i am-ness corp now I have no

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,909
idea what that

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,129
my CPA said that it was really important

00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:54,529
that I be an escort so now I'm in an

00:27:52,129 --> 00:28:06,470
escort I said that sound like it's an

00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:08,269
escort and then take advantage of these

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,799
networking opportunities because these

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,929
are the things that you're going to need

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,570
to get help the marketing consultant

00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:17,240
that I work with on my blog I got

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,129
because my network and I know it's hard

00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,139
there's little just something in here

00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,570
these are delays you can network but hey

00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:24,860
most of us are introverts I know it may

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,749
seem like I'm an extrovert

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,360
look at me I'm smiling I'm talking I'm

00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:31,279
happy but I'm going to sleep like the

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,340
dead tonight when I wake up tomorrow

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,059
morning I'm gonna be like that's

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,830
horrible you see me tomorrow morning I'm

00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:42,559
gonna get zombie because it takes all

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,869
the energy at me after working or after

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,710
it's super zoom I sleep for an entire

00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:51,440
day where I just don't do anything it's

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,480
horrible but you have to you know take

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,269
rights for yourself find a quiet place

00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,950
to hide and mean so you can have a time

00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:02,360
to yourself you also want to get to know

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:06,200
people's names I don't know about you

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,200
guys I suck suck at people's names and

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,149
I'm looking down looking for my hyung

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,129
it's over there but I look around and

00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:16,010
which equals tabs are flipped over as

00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:17,900
they come you are saying hi

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,000
remember your name was sorry I'm good at

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,470
faces I know I knew you I know why

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,330
somebody is somewhere but I will never

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,850
ever remember your names and repeating

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,440
and maybe three times does not work

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,470
he'll figure it out but you know one day

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,790
I'll get there but networking is

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:37,760
important so I do not know how much time

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,100
I have but I wanted to make sure I have

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,460
plenty of time for questions so these

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:46,760
are my resources these slides are

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,520
available there is a you guys can take a

00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,740
picture of that some dinner so there's a

00:29:49,520 --> 00:30:14,030
slides right there WCC SCA 2018 so

00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:15,919
please ask me questions yes I totally

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:18,770
understand it back where I was - and I'm

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,809
a numbers person but what I did is I

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,690
mean there are services you can use that

00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:25,880
make it easier or supposedly make it

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,799
easier I just feel like it's Google

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,020
Apple this in a different package I'm

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,660
not learning anything so what I finally

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,450
did was just sit down and focus on one

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:38,780
section of Google Analytics and I

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,100
focused on the post that people were

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,110
visiting the most and getting an

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,299
understanding of what about these posts

00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,059
for making people visit my site and

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:48,380
that's actually when I really started

00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,730
monetizing was because I went and looked

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,230
at those photos to figure out what's so

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,480
special about them and know

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,039
there's a lot you know errors in this

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,659
site and then while there's an

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,840
opportunity for me to monetize i

00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:02,510
monetize my first blog post of it was

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,470
five alternatives to rawhide shoes for

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,750
dogs and the next month I made 50 bucks

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,190
and that was like what and so I went

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,380
through that entire list I think it was

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,769
like 10 or 15 and I did the same thing

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,919
British post I cleaned it up i optimized

00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,720
it and then I monetize it and then I

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,399
slowly started going through that way so

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,740
just start with a section instead of

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,539
trying to take it all in at once start

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,980
with a section of it and become really

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,850
good at understanding things happening

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,919
there and then do another section and

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:36,860
don't try and do all this in the next

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,440
month it took me years to get here and I

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,169
know it sounds discouraging but if you

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,120
have a date drama be grateful for that

00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:46,190
day job because that day job is allowing

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,200
you to take the time you need to learn

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,269
everything that you need to learn today

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,909
I don't I still don't know everything

00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:54,830
about my Google Analytics but I know a

00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:58,190
lot more than I did in beginning another

00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,710
thing I do is let's go back I use a

00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,480
second site called clicking and in two

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,299
different analytics programs

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,250
I do the clicky is a premium program so

00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,289
I pay more every year and the reason why

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,120
I have to is because one Google

00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,039
Analytics is free and there is no

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,590
customer service for Google Analytics I

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,210
need sometimes to talk to somebody so a

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,000
Google Analytics is doing something

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,200
wonky I want to before I freak out go

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,230
and check and the same thing is

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
happening over on

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,720
if it's happening on cliquey then okay

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,580
then this is real if it's just happening

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,110
on Google Analytics then it's like you

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,160
know I need to dig a little deeper and

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,170
figure out what's going on

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,370
fortunately for me both of them have

00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:47,600
tracked with each other and I haven't

00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:50,180
had a problem yes yes one is called Lu

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,290
empty inside

00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,180
absolutely what are the programs that

00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:58,590
will help you turn to your RSS feed is

00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:00,630
videos lumen five is what it's not

00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,680
perfect but it's great what it does is

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:06,480
it will give you a bunch of slides with

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,820
words on there directly from your blog

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,680
post it'll give you the images that will

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,200
take images from your site it has some

00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:16,560
stock images and then you can go in and

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,480
and create it you can add music to it I

00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,510
believe you can do a voiceover if you

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,800
want to but it's super quick and easy to

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,900
do but I prefer Animoto now anyone Phil

00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,960
will not take your RSS feed but it's

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,970
crazy fast and easy in fact yesterday I

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,520
made three videos with the any mother

00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:38,580
it's super easy to do and those videos

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,440
would look amazing I mean people think

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,520
that they're professionally done and so

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,520
that was I believe

00:33:49,570 --> 00:34:01,550
[Music]

00:33:51,650 --> 00:34:04,610
a in IM oto and moto yes yes sponsored

00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:06,770
the blog post you sure I mean how do you

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,200
charge a flat rate and do you keep them

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,149
up for like the whole time via they

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,500
expired because it just seems like you

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,620
know you charge a flat rate and then

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,730
your you leave it up it seems like

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,649
they're getting a pretty good deal one

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,960
on that kind of stuff they actually are

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:23,179
so his question is um how do I charge

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,300
for sponsored post I do charge a flat

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,610
rate my sponsored posts are really

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,590
in-depth and so the reason why mind

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,840
charging the flat rates and just leaping

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,970
it that way is one I'm making income on

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,850
my traffic so my traffic is monetize

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,980
through the advertising revenue but I

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,540
read a sponsored post not in and like

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,600
hey look at this brand they are awesome

00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:47,270
I always leave it into a story about me

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,409
and my dogs so that it has legs and that

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,230
just means that this is going to be a

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,600
valuable post for years to come and so

00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,250
it's always going to attract traffic so

00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,139
that's a bit of pig meat and that's

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,000
going to add to my advertising income so

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,860
I don't mind doing that one thing that I

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,770
will do is because I have advertising

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,650
income for month one month I'll leave

00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,720
that post ad free so they don't have to

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,790
compete with their competitors ads

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,830
showing up on a sponsor krause that they

00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:15,820
paid for it's just going to be one blank

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:23,630
post and then I'm done

00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:23,630
[Music]

00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,640
okay do I spend money on Facebook or

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:36,580
Instagram ads I do pay for Facebook ads

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,220
but they are like campaigns only I will

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,150
not pay for a Facebook ad campaign or a

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,570
sponsor post

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,120
I feel like my my traffic in my audience

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,010
is enough and one thing that I do is

00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,530
like win for instance if I do a

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,700
sponsored post or you know name a

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,990
product Apple's got an apple so they

00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,940
want me to promote those apples because

00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,680
no one knows about apples I'm going to

00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,540
write a blog post about the benefits of

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,700
apples for dogs I'm also going to do a

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,650
video about the benefits of apples for

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,630
God's I might even do a video of going

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,640
hey guess what guys these guys have sent

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,770
me these great apples look at how shiny

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,750
they are in a few weeks there's going to

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,760
be a blog post just about how great

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,210
these apples are but all of this stuff

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,610
ultimately benefits me and that's who my

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,670
people who come to me response or post

00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:25,810
they're actually not looking - they

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,550
didn't pay for their own Facebook

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,370
advertising if they're looking to spread

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,930
awareness of their apples what they want

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,490
to do is for me to tell my audience

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,990
about Apple's I don't have to do

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,260
Facebook advertising to reach my

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,720
followers on Facebook and Instagram

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,750
my treat instagram has a here's a pretty

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,490
picture of my dog's meals and leave it

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,650
at back simply because i only have so

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:51,450
much time and I like to spend most of my

00:36:47,650 --> 00:37:01,390
social media time on Facebook in YouTube

00:36:51,450 --> 00:37:03,280
yes oh my gosh

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,800
what would I do if I can go back to the

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,830
beginning and that is stop being afraid

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,580
of email marketing I was terrified that

00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,770
I was

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,120
afraid not only an email marketing event

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,700
of advertising as well

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,880
I quickly gained a lot of traffic

00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,850
because I was so alone in this week and

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,170
I didn't monetize it at all I didn't

00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,840
think I didn't know how to I didn't want

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,520
to wait people and I didn't know what I

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,230
was doing I have so many people telling

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,000
me why are you still working full-time

00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,490
with that type of traffic and I was just

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,200
like I don't know I did not know but

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,510
there is all that information out there

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,920
and I would hear about it but I didn't

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,570
know how to do it and I was kind of

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,610
afraid to do it I wish I would have

00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,280
reached out and gotten the help that I

00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,440
needed a long time ago yes

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,540
so keyword research can be kind of tough

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,370
with like a real niche niche do you have

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,830
any tips for how to come up with topics

00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:59,560
and now to optimize those and that sort

00:37:53,830 --> 00:38:03,720
of thing oh it's right there hop keyword

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:08,080
I learned that for me right here

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,900
I have a word of a WordPress meetup

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,250
earth Club is a DIY meetup group and Amy

00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,100
was kind enough to come and talk to our

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,080
group about SEO but those are kind of

00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,870
things that I use I also do things like

00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:24,040
I don't use a whole people Google Google

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,480
Keyword tool I just type in and see what

00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,190
comes up and I'm going to search for

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,620
this what comes up and I know when I

00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,110
look at what is ranking high and then I

00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,720
try and use those type of keywords I

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,100
mean it's just is not that funny because

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,780
I know a lot of people put a lot of time

00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,730
and money in the keyword research I

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,130
never really have I've been pretty

00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,780
fortunate and lucky about it and also it

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,880
helps because I'm very involved in the

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,420
rocking community so I know how y'all

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,980
talk and media my blog posts like media

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,840
member about my own personal life and

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,040
what I'm learning but also it's about

00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,410
the questions

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,460
my readers so I have a keywords right

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:10,060
there that email that they sent to me

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:11,950
yes I am super super busy how much time

00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,620
do I work for the day how much time do I

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:18,100
work on my blog my day job is a 40-hour

00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:22,990
a week job my blog is probably a 30 hour

00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:27,160
a week job I am a superhero I have about

00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:44,290
27 to 28 hours in a typical day and I

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:47,920
probably sleep for an hour and a half no

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,970
I actually mostly post to Facebook oh

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,190
I'm sorry

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,180
you know do I post my cloths different

00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,460
social media sites

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,430
I use the folks like to LinkedIn to

00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,900
Twitter and the Facebook but one it's

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,880
just sort of like my audience is it on

00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,290
Twitter so I was just spamming Twitter

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,550
because I wasn't spending any time over

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,860
there anyone have a question about

00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,570
something I shared they were you know I

00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,580
wasn't going to see it cuz I wasn't over

00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,760
on Twitter I was on Facebook I have I

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,070
miss Bruce I have my pages I have my

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,990
profile so I do everything on Facebook

00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,300
and then I take my blog focus and this

00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,310
is a session that Bob done is duly I

00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,080
believe after this one where you can

00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,970
convert that blog post into different

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,460
types of media and that's basically

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,650
right

00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,950
in two videos I turn them into graphics

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,140
I use upon my mailing list and you all

00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,420
of that sometimes I roll like Facebook

00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,190
has notes last week and I was at a

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,230
conference and so I was logging in

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,359
facebook notes and then I'll take those

00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,280
notes at the Chili's with the update and

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,560
create new blog posts on my site in the

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,960
videos and so on and so forth so that is

00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,760
what's work best for me is find the

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,050
social media sites that work for you a

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,330
lot of times people feel like they have

00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,520
to be on every single one of them you'll

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,740
end up spinning your wheels don't do

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:05,540
that dude go where your audiences and

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:07,490
then you know talk to them there yes how

00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,910
often do I email subscribers every

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:13,040
Tuesday I do it once a week except when

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,800
they first join my list they give a

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,170
follow-up series of three emails and

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,790
it's just sort of like hey thanks for

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,680
joining my name is Kimberly this is what

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,450
I'm all about and the second one is like

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,430

gonna get one more email and the last

00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:36,910
email was like hey buy my book and then

00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:36,910
then they go on a regular weekly email

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:54,200
yes I'm finding myself using all the

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:56,690
time my friend so how do I response it

00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,180
or how people reach me yeah or how are

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,160
you do you ever like cinnamon mailing on

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,320
Facebook to them do I use the Facebook

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,650
messengers for my email list no I

00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,480
actually think about

00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,550
the truck shifts and maybe I'll change

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,560
my mind in the year or two but it drives

00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,790
me crazy when I accidentally end up

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,290
clicking something and it means if

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:17,850
someone's going to start emailing me via

00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:20,160
messenger I am kind of popular into the

00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:23,430
blogging space they attack not blogging

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,860
space but the pet Rafi world I get so

00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,380
many messages via messenger via email

00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,170
everything that I can barely keep up

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,670
with it and I can't have people sending

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,080
me random stuff that I don't mean so I

00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,780
want to do that to people

00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,570
I find that email that I use Gmail and

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,350
then people do message me via messenger

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,390
and I do know

00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,550
all right message sent back but I try

00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,440
not to use that service and another

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,260
reason why I don't want to use it is if

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,620
Facebook goes away then I just lost a

00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:56,520
valuable thing I want my list to be mine

00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:59,960
not Facebook's and I'm worried that

00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,960
Facebook might just go away

00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:14,970
anyone else yes do I hear the email

00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:17,610
service I use huh it was a weather

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,290
I just which day whether I was with

00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,570
MailChimp for a really long time

00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,930
I use a weber and i just started using

00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:28,230
leadpages and i didn't want to have to

00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:31,620
do it I know I I use Divi as my that's

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:34,410
my thing with my blog and Davie can't

00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:37,020
allows you to do landing pages and

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:41,010
things like that I just didn't like the

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,950
way the signup page has looked they

00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,500
weren't his glossy and pretty and so I

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,820
live with leadpages I figured that you

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,400
know it's hard to spit

00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,700
this is something I should have says be

00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,290
wary about dropping dropping dumping a

00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,540
lot of money in two different things

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:01,000
it's easy to get excited about something

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,380
and give someone $200 thinking that it's

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,540
gonna change everything and it changes

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,520
nothing or you end up not using it don't

00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,220
waste money that way really take the

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,890
time and you know educate yourself

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,020
asking for questions before I went with

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,640
leadpages I talked to everybody about

00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,130
what my options were I could have done

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,810
the same thing for free but it wouldn't

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,490
look these guys and so my thought was

00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,940
that I'll go ahead and pay for a service

00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,620
that looks great and then my list will

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,570
pay for that and then I don't have to

00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,800
worry about it but just really be

00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,380
careful about what you want to spend

00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,780
money on it's easy so easy to get people

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,310
I'm talking about to be paying for their

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,860
service that'll teach me how to monetize

00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,270
their blog you don't need that all the

00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:45,850
information about it you just gotta take

00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:51,450
the time and go and find it yes five

00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:51,450
minutes I got five minutes you guys yes

00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:03,130
you know what I did stop using MailChimp

00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,750
because melt it became too expensive for

00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:07,960
while I was using it for which was

00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,640
basically nothing and so I switch to a

00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,900
lever the reason why I switch to a weber

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,160
is because they've reached out to me and

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,630
said hey if you want to come and join us

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,010
we'll give you a month for free and

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,260
we'll teach you how to use and they did

00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,260
they have been I actually have a person

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,210
a Twitter that emails me each month to

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,369
see how annoyed they check how my emails

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,200
go and they contact me as they hate that

00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:27,970
last email mins and this wedding that

00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,980
this being open together that you know

00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:33,880
here's an idea for you what you start

00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:36,010
doing this they are amazing and so I was

00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,170
yeah someone I could have gone to it

00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,390
even another one that I'm really happy

00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,160
with their customer service and I don't

00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:44,589
know if this is normal or if it will

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,720
last but I'm happy right now so I'm

00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:47,740
gonna stick with them and if they're

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,910
super easy to use

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:55,720
yes how big is my list my list is very

00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:58,329
small I left I left a list of over 5000

00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,799
on Belgium and now I have a list of

00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:04,990
about a thousand right now I just

00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:06,220
article on a whether I don't want it I

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,250
didn't want to take my list with me

00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,839
because I don't trust that those people

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,420
join the list for the same reasons I

00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:15,309
want to jump to build this list through

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,640
my funnels and I want to know exactly

00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:20,079
like that these three lists I want to

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,279
know that these people joined this list

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,319
because they're brand new in Iraq

00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,670
meeting and these people join this list

00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:26,859
because they want to know about how to

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,049
save money on Rafi and these people to

00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:30,080
read this list because thank God they

00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:31,940
wanted to give away

00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:36,230
with something and then I know how to

00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,700
deal with each of those lists also I

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,440
didn't want to have a bunch of people

00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,420
add it to this new list then I start

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,150
emailing all the time and the biggest

00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,980
all and subscribe or hit spam or

00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,970
something I want people knowing exactly

00:46:45,980 --> 00:47:01,370
what they're getting into

00:46:46,970 --> 00:47:02,750
yes so he's asking did I warned the

00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,690
people in my old list that I was leaving

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,010
and guess I get Iost it all about it

00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,840
reminded people I sent people to

00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,310
reminder key balance to say hey this is

00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,260
the last email that you're going to get

00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:17,510
if you still want to bottle it here is

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:22,430
the link and yes this is how about you

00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:25,270
ask people are monetizing and stuff can

00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:30,650
you explain what it's been in the best

00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:32,990
I'm sure you covered it already so the

00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,820
best way so I'm going to just say the

00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,800
best way to monetize my blog have been

00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,470
the most profitable ways number one is

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,840
the advertising I do advertising through

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:45,320
media buys and it is fantastic that

00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,150
company is amazing they are they have a

00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,710
vested interest into making money

00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,010
because when I make money they make

00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:54,200
money and the the resources they have

00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,000
for bloggers they have a room that they

00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,150
have you couldn't talk to them I mean it

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,770
I am blown away and because I have a

00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,450
natural focus blahh

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:06,630
I don't need science diet ad

00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:08,400
on my Rafi blog but if I go through this

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,910
day hey no more kibble ass that's gonna

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,450
cut into my revenue so they worked with

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:17,309
me to find a way to deliver the most

00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:20,880
amount of ads I can make the most money

00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:23,579
without sacrificing my message and ease

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,079
ultimately with ads it's if you're

00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,270
visiting my site that's going to be your

00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,010
search history the drive to actual of my

00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,809
site but I still want to be able to

00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,280
control some of the content that's

00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,710
showing up on my site today if it's

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,740
amazing about it the second one is

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,059
affiliate marketing I belong to several

00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,130
affiliate marketing programs I'm very

00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,750
particular about life I will join them

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,829
because I only promote the products that

00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:49,020
I use or have use or believe in with my

00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:51,119
dogs to my audience and that's because

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,670
if they have questions I can answer

00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,650
those questions and so it makes it just

00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,839
so much easier but that is my second

00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:02,910
moneymaker and then after that would be

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:04,470
the sponsored posts and sponsorships so

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,650
I think one more question

00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:14,329
one more question please so how many

00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:14,329
pages and integrate that into

00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:28,890
it seems like when I just work or well

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,989
so how do i integrate leadpages in my

00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,959
WordPress website there is a plug-in and

00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:35,640
so oh man that helped me integrate it

00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,829
into my WordPress website and the reason

00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,869
why I went with weekly pages of not just

00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:41,609
WordPress is because it just didn't look

00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:44,069
nice I've seen other sites that

00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:46,380
collected emails you know in exchange or

00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:49,019
like here's a guide to help you do this

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,309
and it looks so nice when I was just

00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,229
doing it with WordPress

00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:53,430
it just looked awful because they would

00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:54,959
be on my site when they click the link

00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,089
and their take it off my site to this

00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:58,529
really weird page where they put in

00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,119
their email address and it's not clear

00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,890
if it's lying or not and I couldn't

00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,690
figure out how to make that look nice

00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,729
and then that took them to another page

00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,259
when I just integrate it lean and use

00:50:05,729 --> 00:50:09,239
into my website they just entered

00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:11,339
everything into my website and that was

00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,859
it and was just so nice and easy so

00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:18,299
that's what I ended up tying

00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:20,910
yes Jim incentive for we're gonna like I

00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:22,949
mean did they get a guy yes I do have

00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:25,259
incentives for emails what I did was I

00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:28,589
just pick up the best as soon as I found

00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:30,660
are my list books so 22 ways to save

00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:32,670
money are all feeding bones after tonnes

00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,819
I just turned it into a SlideShare like

00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,979
this exported into a PDF and give it to

00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:39,449
them I save it into Google Docs and then

00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:43,229
have that link so people can go and get

00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:45,979
it that way he's going to do so thank

00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:45,979
you so much

00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,510
