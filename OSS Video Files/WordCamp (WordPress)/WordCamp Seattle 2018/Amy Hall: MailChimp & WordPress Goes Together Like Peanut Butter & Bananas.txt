00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,940
beautiful synergy versus G Jesus were

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:17,000
dressed at my concert here in Costa

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,990
Community College and trying to cause an

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,400
awkward we're gonna speed up your bank

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:27,590
is you can even fold on this which runs

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:47,950
with a business partner and husband

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:47,950
Terry please give it up people hear you

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,780
so imagine that you're ready for your

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,380
local city council after psycho though

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,380
you're adding raw content you're adding

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,770
your events and everything's coming

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,799
along how do you stay in a conversation

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,469
with the people that have expressed an

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,049
interest

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,469
in your political views in your vision

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,740
and knocking doors for you but most

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,149
important to give you donations so the

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,590
answer from my plant

00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:42,179
Jovie with email so the wordpress bite

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,619
is her virtual campaign office where

00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,509
people can go to learn about the

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,780
qualifications her vision for the

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,560
community her event calendar and the

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,830
importance of email about her to reach

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,390
out to her people on a regular basis so

00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,119
when she needed people standing on the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,189
corners to hold funds they were she

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,530
reached out to them via email and they

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,319
were there which needed donations will

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,880
enough she reached out via email after

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:15,209
donations for that so email allowed her

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:20,220
to build a very strong and volunteer

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:24,930
base oh and by the way and this past

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,350
election distance last week she won so

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,959
can you see that maybe running a

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:36,780
campaign it's very similar to running on

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,530
business so here and just like not like

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,530
super nervous

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,760
alright so the three things we're going

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,410
to think we're going to talk about today

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,829
is three things about wonderful

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,829
WordPress

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,250
how do you smell Jim and WordPress

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,440
together to read a synergy and under

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,470
that topic we're going to do mail check

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,950
forms for WordPress free hops and offers

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:21,530
and drip campaigns so does everybody

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:27,959
know it at the term campaign sort

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:31,200
campaign is when you send emails you

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,299
have a specific number females maybe you

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,450
might send three or you makes them

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,730
twenty but everybody starts at email

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,500
number one and usually it's kind of a

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,299
sales type of campaign and we'll get

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,849
into that more but I wanted to make sure

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,299
that you guys all understand on a drip

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,310
campaign it's not like a newsletter

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:53,060
everybody starts at email number one no

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:59,370
matter where they went

00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:03,660
chronologically they've liked that so on

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:07,790
WordPress raised software it's easy to

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,079
make up well kind of easy to make a

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,920
professional looking website easier than

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,870
it used to be

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:22,400
and there's tons of resources lots of

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:28,639
things lots of plugins so I assert that

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:32,030
mansion is just like it's free software

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,550
if you have two thousand or less email

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,570
addresses in your list and you sound

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,669
less than 12 thousand emails a month so

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,820
get two thousand email addresses you can

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:55,130
send six email a month and still stay in

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:57,229
that belgian range nobody I know it's

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:03,740
easy to make professional-looking emails

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:05,780
and newsletters newsletters and emails

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,800
for me how attendants seem to be exactly

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,039
the same

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,530
we're not talking like if you're

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,479
emailing from your Gmail that's

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,500
completely different and I use as many

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,539
orders sorry alright so lots and lots of

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,120
lots and lots and lots of integrations

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:25,840
without you there are social media

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
integrations or smoogle analytics at

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,539

integrate PACOM you can integrate

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:51,229
setting up you can integrate ecommerce

00:05:47,930 --> 00:06:01,910
with WooCommerce and Shopify and that's

00:05:51,229 --> 00:06:04,870
just like scratching please ask

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,360
questions during

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,400
I want all questions to stay in context

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:16,810
and we leave them to the end we'll lose

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:18,760
the context of stuff Bantam forms you

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,230
should always have a subscription form

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,630
on your website almost always police

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,970
police always have a subscription form

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,450
on your website even if your only email

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:32,860
a quarterly have a subscription form on

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:37,050
your website and your subscription form

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,420
should be prominent not in your footer I

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:46,240
just helped one lady and her developer

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:47,680
printer form to her foot when our people

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
told them to your footer and they

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,950
thought she's not going to be doing

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,950
subscriptions or just owning on them

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:09,100
forms not to put WordPress WordPress you

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,770
can use the in smiling with that and

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,810
there is a premium you can pay for the

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:21,010
premium plug-in and then you can do drag

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,070
and drop styling so intermediate forms

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:28,330
easy forms for MailChimp again you're

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,580
going to use CSS for the stuff so this

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,840
is my favorite form it's super easy and

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:38,350
it's always beautiful I like pretty

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,440
forms they're not too pretty and so I

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,070
want them to be pop I want them to look

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,070
