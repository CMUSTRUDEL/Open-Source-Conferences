Title: Robert Nissenbaum: Connecting the Dots: The Relationship Between WordPress, SEO, and Social Media.
Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	The audience will leave with an understanding of why how a WordPress site is developed matters for SEO and the role their content and social media plays in search engine optimization and driving website traffic well beyond organic search.
Websites are the foundation for a successful online marketing system. WordPress sites, however, cannot exist as a standalone entity. Search engine optimization cannot be an afterthought, nor can the core content be. It is absolutely necessary for developers, content creators, SEOs, and business owners to understand this and HOW content and social media marketing are intertwined to create successful WordPress sites.
This can be a standard talk or a “hands-on’ session. In previous talks (including WordCamp Las Vegas 2017, discussion drove the presentation. Having the ability to walk through the process, as opposed to simply explaining it, increases the value the audience receives.

to make sure you guys leave here with

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,670
something actionable not just what I

want I you so if you have questions we

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,720
will make Dustin run around with my

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,300
truck

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,470
debit remember my friend gave me some

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,700
exercise that yes I have my steps yet

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,670
today so for my background I can using

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,450
social media since 2007 so for Facebook

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,020
pages I was using a Mac TV bro my brains

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:46,440
and I started blowing shortly after that

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,780
very little of note any not Lagaan what

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,740
search engine optimization was no

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,500
experience in content marketing

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,450
obviously nothing specific about social

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,899
media marketing everything wasn't time

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,179
what I found over time after getting it

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,230
phone call from the hosting provider I

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,350
was using rules

00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:11,040
my website back in 1998 was asking me

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,010
what the hell's going on that only do 85

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,410
minutes say the search traffic pending

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,000
the number of hits on my website just

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,920
better jumping it's beyond what they

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,600
were used to see and no idea why this is

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,100
happening and you know anything that I

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,250
just knew it was and I found that over

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,860
time because I was having a posting

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,870
contact to my blog based on I'm just

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,850
simple updates use things that people

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,830
with Norman just asked me on an everyday

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,750
basis that I was actively campaigning

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,510
German and rather than having to tell

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,860
everybody every single time I could

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,140
publish these items there was a

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,350
reference point I would share these out

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,110
on social media I was interacting with

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,140
other people on social media I was

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,240
seeing results couldn't really connect

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,810
everything as to why he's hurting I just

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,610
knew it was to make sure that this

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,380
meeting he was not just a outside

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,180
phenomena where I set up my this

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,120
business I have now tactical social

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,970
media 2015 I figured out how to use

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,630
WordPress well enough to build a mini

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,160
crappy website technically correct the

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,800
site will be updated is still crappy

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,780
their pages that don't blow crowd what I

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,680
was after is showing I can use social

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,610
media to drive search ranking they said

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,760
what I'm doing

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,070
ignoring every traditional SEO rule book

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,080
I have never done just a keyword

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:41,250
research of any shape or form I don't

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,200
pay much attention other than making

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,040
sure as much as possible and ghostess

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,070
cream but that's about the limits landed

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,420
I simply wrote a coach naturally the

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,730
only piece I had booked me at the time

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,450
that in a published writer for a since

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,900
high school

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,090
and all this kinda clicked about two

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,849
years ago so after this business has

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,989
been running for a while I was asked to

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,040
explain search engine optimization I've

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,620
been talking about that and reading

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,970
events and I've got three itself and it

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,780
kind of dawned to me that everything

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,579
I've been doing online all this time was

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,480
looking at something the whole point

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,639
network

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,079
I never promoted myself I still do this

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,100
they don't care a business card to hell

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:30,180
with us and what I do I am and I'm

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,190
specifically asking the thought came up

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,139
what if Google was actually trying to

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,290
behave online through their search

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:40,020
elements when we do everyday with people

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,490
we talk to that if somebody were to ask

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,650
you for a recommendation

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,740
how do you take if I ask my friend for

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,200
recognition who I even hired a depicts a

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,669
group and I'm the one would have two

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,380
years talking one that he's fixed this

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,270
room several times he keeps some funny

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,700
about leads they've been fixed you think

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,640
so - oh no he's talked about replacing

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,200
your roof over time this gives me a good

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,300
idea that it's probably looking at this

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,760
point having a place wants me to replace

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,650
roof mount error that is effectively

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,110
Google taking our search history and I

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,930
would be online and the way we appraise

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,890
their question and forming the intent of

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,970
what we're asking for that query and

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,169
then I'm going to take all that piece

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,139
and figure out who I'm going to

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,139
recommend

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,060
through first thing I'm going to think

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,879
about is who is capable of doing that

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,439
job who has the expertise me it already

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,430
actually that the work done right now

00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,529
because obviously we're not working for

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,069
anybody that's incapable of doing the

00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:43,270
job we think the person needs the second

00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,120
thing that asketh on the mind is

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,009
professional will they return phone

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,889
calls having been down time kind of be

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,479
on budget will they return phone calls

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,340
when necessary if something goes wrong

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,090
afterwards are they going to be around

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,590
we are very low behavior to recommend

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,509
somebody that is not going to be

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,629
responsible reliable no matter how good

00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:06,400
they are and then are you exceptions to

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,979
that rule as you have enough credibility

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,379
behind you some of that professional to

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:14,050
drop off but in March this is what we

00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:16,719
use when I first did this presentation I

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,419
also included locale but now Google has

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,620
that automatically at this point and

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,960
none of the planets and businesses that

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,029
I talk to my friends they will prep

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,370
reporting the Seattle to do a job okay

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,199
it's raining the customers right so

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,789
location of a little bit less importance

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,490
depending the brand especially for

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,879
WordPress developers or good graphic

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:42,279
design we really will have it Geographic

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:44,770
constraints and I was wondering about

00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,680
how Google does this and I started

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,060
looking into Google search and they came

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,569
across an article that was published in

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,490
search engine journal February 2nd 2017

00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,800
so we're about a you're changing two

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,000
years out of date at this point but

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,430
based on everything I'm still reading

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,250
this is fairly relevant and pretty much

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:07,599
on point now and what I found that I

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,300
hope the top four ranking factors Google

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,229
uses or content backlinks mobile

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,060
responsive distant technical factors at

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,340
this point when we've shifted in terms

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,880
of our most industries

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,590
mobile responsiveness now calls into

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,620
technical factors things like PDA the

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:31,140
fact that Google's actually using mobile

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,670
speed as a direct ranking factor and the

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,350
interesting thing is that you do pull up

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,080
the list of those someone 200 ranking

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:42,420
factors that working that algorithm it

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,650
all point back to nice it really just

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,960
boils down to this and to get this right

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,480
a Google search quality senior

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,610
strategist in March of 2016 basically

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,980
stated that if you are right you need

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:03,330
content of evidence that was ready to

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:06,900
throw the Delta look at it contacts your

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,310
expertise back make sure your 30 mobile

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,170
responses are testing mobile

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,070
responsiveness technical factors are

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,070
your professionalism

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:22,740
well homing lonesome and really playing

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,760
the glass to this comes down to your

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:30,000
website that if you want to rank it

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,390
starts at the website level this is

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,610
talking about things like your slow

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:39,360
determining structures robots.txt file

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,890
sitemaps this is known about page speeds

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,290
or all the things in the back end of the

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,980
site we're messy instructs me that

00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:49,710
websites good so a if you're developer

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,630
make sure this stuff is rarely number

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,280
one again how prettiest site looks

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,560
doesn't matter in terms of whether to

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,650
the rank or not if this is it here and

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,220
it's free and doesn't Ronnie doesn't

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,310
matter much

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,699
like it or not and the end I will say

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,800
functional over critical and to that and

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:17,620
funny website just landed global plank

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,480
it still works if you're looking to have

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,670
a website built find it the demo better

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,170
and actually of doing this and there are

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,019
a couple of tools out there that you can

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,300
play with and aren't you listed here for

00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:36,069
safe speed and testing on UDP metrics

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,480
calm I know the problem was that partner

00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:40,149
up with another firm here that statue

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,709
doing site speed tests and it's actually

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,680
pretty much on par with what I'm finding

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,420
GT metrics the other one I look for

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,569
things like

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,370
accessibility issues how people appear

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:55,019
on mobile and are rendered in touch tax

00:09:51,370 --> 00:10:00,220
etc Barbie calm and I have to spent help

00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:03,040
up to date this is VAR DUI and it would

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,430
point even a litany of HTML code every

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:12,220
across the slightest again how about

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,629
both the site is once the site so

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,170
everything else comes kind of the

00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:20,019
content you must have new content on

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,120
your site on a regular basis and I'm not

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,649
like these were consistent because that

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,620
means you have to do chosen specific

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,430
time it's less about how often we do it

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,990
and make sure we do keep tapping it

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,120
because no matter how authoritative site

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,490
is to start with like for most leading

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,889
expert if you disappear for face to the

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,430
earth for two years and we haven't heard

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,170
from you

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,759
we have no idea two movies still hard at

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,470
expert even if you've been doing

00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,920
everything in the back end nothing

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,100
give us any sort of group that you are

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,630
content on the website keeping with this

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,570
natural human piece that we have in the

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,670
real world is your portfolio by looking

00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,080
roofing company and there's some old

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,180
roofs they worked on all these pieces

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,920
they've done that's great

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,510
it does give you sense they're capable

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,450
of doing the job they've got plenty of

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:12,040
experience or the job it still doesn't

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,290
mean they can be together and even when

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,660
I get a recommendation with a friend

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,260
this always has extra piece that's

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,480
negatives a trusted source but I want

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,670
some third-party validation so I want

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,850
some extra testimonials why are we have

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:32,740
testimony on our websites online

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,260
does your backwards that's why point to

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,720
the concept you can have all the content

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,290
of the numeral about a particular top

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,810
you can clearly be an expert you or

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,640
website to show that according to Google

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,260
to see you would likely to be the

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,950
authority on this base the amount of

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,490
content but there's still no anything

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,410
that actually states you are and getting

00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,790
those backlinks pointing to your content

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,670
or your site as a whole helps get Google

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:09,490
some third-party recognition that yes

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,450
this is authoritative content the other

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,750
piece about back things like

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,300
testimonials where they come from

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,790
matters as much as getting to infer

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,960
splits so everybody's going home about

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,510
getting testimonials on the website

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,160
every Bay says they work they did I

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:29,410
ignore testimonials I might be if it's a

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,990
customer of yours we're not going to put

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,300
up a negative

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,010
so all you're doing is listing positive

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,990
testimonials have ever wondered with the

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,750
hardenable positive or you're just

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,250
missing the negative ones when they're

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,830
testing items on websites one of the

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:47,940
things I'm looking for would be who's

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,520
ready if you're a roofing company and

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,640
you have a testimonial on the website of

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,500
the roofing company they hire you to

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,020
help out them when their crews could to

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,720
get a job done later comedy to larger

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:04,590
table needed help and they said you did

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,000
an amazing job that matters to me I for

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,950
more faith that you can do the job

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,540
because it's coming from another expert

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,560
in your field their site and I can see

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,050
that looks like they know what they're

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,990
doing that validates you and Google uses

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,460
their backlink profile so that all of

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,450
your we saw all of your backlinks are

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,360
coming through just a little local

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,670
businesses it's going to have a certain

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,500
guy like speaker being brought in from

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,880
out of state for example news use trying

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,830
to speak if I'm going to be plumb headed

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,870
from here to New York Lieber

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,100
specifically speak to a group on a topic

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,730
that's going to bring a huge amount of

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,930
30 somebody's went run away same thing

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,090
if you're getting testimonials from

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:52,080
others around the world as opposed to

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:54,570
just low it's most likely the

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,520
necessarily deep Frannie's family or the

00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,600
people related this is more than just

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,720
directory dates you really need to get

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,880
backlinks from others who carry enough

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,740
credibility to give you credit for me

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,050
that's what people they do search engine

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:18,120
optimization social media probably not

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,890
is how do we get those packets it is

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,860
order to get backlinks the content has

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,710
to be visible to anybody who want the

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,320
from which means they have to find it in

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,820
search which require their preference

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,820
and we have a chicken

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:40,890
that menacingly and a lot of people

00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:44,730
simply take their content share Facebook

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:46,560
Twitter is Trevor and call that good for

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,260
work the word figure out how to get seen

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,900
by the right people

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:57,510
yep first stop showing up the new Suites

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:59,040
anyway good luck the second piece is all

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,240
the important later probably want to

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,060
reach that live we can give you goes

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,320
down the back links and sit during their

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:09,180
feeding scroll hit a certain point I'm

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,170
posting my stuff I'm not welcome to look

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,290
at anything else and that's where

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,670
typical behaviors all we do one behind

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,590
in social media is we actually post

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,080
content and publish it here folks are

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:23,160
there returning to children this view

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:28,230
it's not going to do anything I network

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:34,530
I am doing on mine where I used to do

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:38,370
and still do in person I am time to

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:41,610
identify anybody that could provide a

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,130
valuable backwards I try and stay within

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,680
the concept of influencer marketing just

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,580
seems shave the knee and I'm not trying

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,260
to use anybody that you fill me up in my

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,150
industry I can actually equal for

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,980
anybody the does photography so there's

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,940
another presentation over here in the

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,980
room Josh Hudson he's talking about

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,360
using your time stock photography and

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,480
websites and the problem with it

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,880
I talk a lot about using it use of

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,430
images and creating images for website

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,290
so that actually will show properly

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:19,410
media great I I can easily write content

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,420
and you get the funds them that gives me

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,700
great value make that a very old

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,120
distance s got a great following in

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:30,810
credibility there's not to pay directly

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,790
to what I'm doing when I find these

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,670
people very different and what most

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,329
people do on social media no more than

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,220
30 percent of your time

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,519
we've spent publishing new content on

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,519
your page

00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:47,889
there are times I will do no more than

00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,929
one post per week I have six months

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:52,299
ahead without posting much of anything

00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:54,939
on my Facebook page for the last month

00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:57,819
or so and for those are about speaking

00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:01,420
here now I'm even talking about that

00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:06,819
content I inspected over 70% of my time

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:09,240
Network I identified these friends as my

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,620
brand

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,149
so if we use social Facebook as an

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,209
example for this because it's easier for

00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:21,699
us to get our heads around I am going to

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:23,500
other business pages Hudson design work

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,709
our plugins been great it's a familiar

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,809
with the social sharing party I am

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,169
actually going to their Facebook pages

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:35,830
as tactical soil immediately I am liking

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:38,200
their posts I am taking the time to find

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,080
content they're publishing that I can

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,260
actually respond to acceptable social

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,010
media do we need such a waiter and I you

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,710
to their conversation the typical type

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,570
of times I see some people post these

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,980
are the top 4 reasons why you should be

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:59,889
doing this and I'll go through love 1 3

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,309
& 4 I would probably change to there was

00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:05,679
me giving this list abyss here's what

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:09,070
even if that's what long comment that

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,679
does two things it starts being a

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:16,120
conversation with that of a brand now

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:20,139
firm didn't they see that I thought I'm

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,889
talking about anybody else seen it also

00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:25,480
see something boring this and they

00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,760
prompt them at that point to want to

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,210
know more about Who I am now so over my

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,070
brand will pop up a preview and they

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,090
just ended up

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,580
my cage the other way to do this is I

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,350
take time to look for content a lot of

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,800
time for my content that I do publish

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,630
come from is everybody else I spend more

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,050
time sharing concepts sometimes when I'm

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,660
creating my own and I simply add to it

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:54,930
so it's a cross between share content

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,580
and original and I'm doing that sharing

00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,580
that content I'm hopefully tagging them

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,760
in the page as well so that I might

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:06,240
actually send that comment and they have

00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,560
a post share their post love this post

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,440
by sucking such I have a change number

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,630
two to this here's why

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,160
bonus ever probably has this and I will

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,820
tell you some of my facebook posts two

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,520
three four hundred work well don't bring

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,960
that things from the newsfeed the team

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,990
here is I'm trying to get everybody to

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:34,710
go back to you my pain trek skip the

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:36,240
newsfeed say it all a material and the

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,380
reason I make sure those tags are in

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,720
there even if I'm sharing your content

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,420
you should be notified fully tagged show

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,660
up especially on Facebook and of course

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:49,590
a little more tag we want to know who

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:54,120
checked us in wine and that tag should

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:56,010
drive them back to the door page they'll

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,850
specifically end up on your post of the

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:01,050
theories that there's not in your page

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:05,190
here's the thing about getting to a page

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,840
for the first time how many times you

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,650
get to a business page for the first

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,270
time do you only read the first post

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,310
don't

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:18,020
this is has done stuff you will be down

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:21,180
several posts and you will keep reading

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:26,640
until you decide you're done it can't do

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:28,410
it any good books people typing all the

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,810
time I will no one reads a 5,000 word

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,790
blog yep I'm on three to five thousand

00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,890

good having contact it's written well be

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:41,030
reading my entire conference

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,010
Publishing my pages is strictly around

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,610
getting people to move through my

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:49,220
content I want you reading six seven

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,910
eight ten twelve twenty eight post feet

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,950
I know it works because I'm did it

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,220
content with six months to a year will

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,130
be be shared we're being commenting or

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,770
being in light and a half with on a

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,780
regular basis and that plant when four

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,420
o'clock finger deals it's a six month

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,000
old post and one specific we have posted

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,160
that on to like wonderful things two

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,350
years ago they went back and foeman

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,510
simply please call me post their own we

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,580
got agreed down that for when I see that

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,460
hooks and you care that it showed up in

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,190
the news so the peace now in time to

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,560
back inside of this is if you are

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,770
publishing under website trading blog

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,010
articles and you are sharing them a long

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,650
way is for your content strategy that at

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:43,940
some point I will be done in depth with

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:46,580
all these are blog posts from my site to

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,220
pieces here this comes up in regular

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,280
basis I will never say I just published

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,620
a blog post or reading I will never turn

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,370
around and simply say hey this is a

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,740
great article go read because if I come

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,620
across that I'm just blowing through if

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,640
I do not receive this I am NOT going on

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,580
a wild goose chases it someone comes to

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,020
me as being a bit of creepy even if it's

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,460
your own content and it seems like

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,049
you're certainly trying to get me to my

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:21,799
to your website

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:23,929
you know I want I want you on my slate

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,909
because you want to be there I'm

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:26,860
summarizing my content body of these

00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,450
folks

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,249
my hope is you can tell you it up and

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,100
you want to click that link and follow

00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:37,399
through and if you're trying to reach

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,899
somebody at influencer levels so maybe

00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:42,139
that can really help you

00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:46,509
I didn't you they're not going to click

00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:51,049
through if you just tell them to do so

00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:55,190
read this they like hope is now that

00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:56,600
I've got on this WordPress site that

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:02,869
they may go running to leave something

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:05,210
else hydrated and at that point and

00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:07,820
they're creating content and they not

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,359
figure out why an authority figure based

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:14,480
on everything I've put out there or it's

00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:18,769
moving into what they're doing there's a

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:23,539
chance they gave me of that work our

00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:27,320
plugins after all after this is again

00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:32,749
long time long-term investment this is

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,340
almost three years back and forth with

00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:38,899
the principles behind this and their

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,320
team this is what they published on

00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:43,399
their website that's linked back to me

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,049
and now I'm going to get the faculty

00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:47,570
value because they have a highly

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,369
authoritative site this blog post alone

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,119
that's four plus share is they've got

00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:56,419
blog posts that have 2,000 plus shares

00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,799
in a well-read site but this also gives

00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,409
me an extra bonus they get referral

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:03,159
traffic from this directly to my website

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:03,159
it's a two for one year

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:08,600
that's one big piece on top of that they

00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:12,489
have additional to click between which

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,489
also points back to my social profiles

00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:20,869
this is me taking the time using social

00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:22,750
media to network with other brands that

00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:24,309
can help me

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,610
and I am doing so in such a way that

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:29,440
actually helps definitely this help that

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,010
will create content without them having

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,539
to go old work and means other people

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,450
are saying the same things that they're

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:42,270
safe even if they were a higher

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,270
authority level than I am this is so bad

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:53,070
but I go to more than just the bathrooms

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:55,330
uniqueness just biking opportunities

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,090
bridges is not the only website when I

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,809
passed against bla bla there are quite a

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,299
few and this is need to go to me now the

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:08,770
publish content elsewhere that

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:11,080
potentially links back to me and at the

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:15,100
same time if you're joining this getting

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,980
some recognition this is a syndicated

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,880
look this is a article that I wrote that

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,770
syndicated on business twitter.com

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:29,020
Twitter's home website now leads back to

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:32,500
me this is three years plus of doing

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,860
this but this is done amazing things to

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,240
my search capability and then what I am

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,520
just being pieces about how I'm using

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,740
social media and never said that any

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,720
point the thing that I

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,220
like on my plate I am not using Avenues

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,059
results me on the other words on my

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,490
friend her goal

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,790
building relationships yes with them not

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,440
predominately with others in my industry

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,370
because when my plants will likely find

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,040
me aren't finding employment at Google

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,590
search I want to make sure I show up in

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,700
a search pedal everything relationships

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,650
with body influencers others that they

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,840
support every what I do so that when I

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:18,179
do talk Minister we make my class

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,970
repeats that you planted bottom line if

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,309
you're watering your site's have to be a

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,350
third to that means a solid content

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,870
marketing strategy it means an effective

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:31,040
social media marketing strategy and he's

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:35,340
having a properly built website start

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,480
don't have a boat don't necessarily care

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,480
what else you're gonna do you're gonna

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,520
have a hard time ranking the proof of

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,610
all this how many people where mazels

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,100
domain authority scores okay so

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,500
basically they website has zero

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,570
authority they stop their algorithm for

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:58,320
bring the domain that it is and no

00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:00,600
history of site and as you publish

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,400
content as one that leads as the profile

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,000
filled that the man Authority increases

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,610
and it exponentially that's heart

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,160
increase or Easter of different 0 to 10

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:15,990
10 to 20 20 to 30 my website might

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,679
created took 11 months to get to the

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:24,620
main authority 19 and 13 months to get

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:27,660
to 23 the page Authority a 33 15 take I

00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:31,200
was able to do in 12 months contact

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,500
social media what some SEO firms can

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,690
take six years to do with the nonsense

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:43,100
and all this really like getting people

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:43,100
from my website or to my website

00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,269
nope

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:07,279
if you don't give us the box back now

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:10,789
and they have an SEO tool hi what advice

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:22,070
or strategies do you have around SEO

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:24,559
title in early so I pay some attention

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,149
to it a lot of times when you put a

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,210
little stuff and pause and say where you

00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:31,519
go through two yolks or Co schedule

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,840
which is a publishing scheduling puck

00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,559
with the social media does have a

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,529
headline analyzer they'll say this is

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,490
what would be the best title I'll have

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,789
ignored completely

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,500
this is what I want to tell you so one

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,289
of those that have the first search

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,909
engine optimization comes down to it if

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,490
I don't know something we're not playing

00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:54,950
by again polos rules if it works out it

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,600
fits and trade perfect if it's going to

00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,070
take too long to turn optimize to get

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,340
the title right hit something else

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,570
I just tried the only rule I have really

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,419
make sure that whatever that many

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:08,210
searches matches what the content of my

00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,779
pages does so the search they're going

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,779
to actually get

00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:21,349
so the nice party authority cited other

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,599
[Music]

00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:32,639
you know let's say the number 25 I don't

00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:36,979
know if that slight consider we good

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,979
about by industry

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:53,650
so have you figure so I spent a lot of

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,820
time try to figure out what is good or

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,070
bad because I want to be able to say

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,040
that's for a small business both of them

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:03,460
are 59:19 we're screwed - even better I

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,170
think the numbers were like 3040 was my

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,799
yield where you want to be for small

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,220
business

00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:13,419
most of us being out there is in that 20

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,429
to 30 range so on one level it's simply

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,600
just a guide to help me move forward so

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,130
for me it's about moving that needle

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,440
forward more than is worried about the

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,510
specific number it just gave me a

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,970
benchmark initially to say that I can

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,840
recite in that short period of time this

00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,730
far with this so I was able to actually

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,740
verify the whole things I've been doing

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:41,770
all along actually work and every

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:43,419
something hard gainers show I was just

00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,679
wondering if you had some method of

00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:46,679
choosing influencers

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:57,559
there was do you actually look up there

00:30:48,720 --> 00:31:00,210
debated so where a lot of this came from

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:04,590
90 to 90 plus percent of the industry

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:06,179
approach yes here I'm over here so why

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,550
this was spent I'm just searching for

00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,710
help people on Facebook ups Facebook the

00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,630
same way you search Google I just put up

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,300
the bar I could be looking up for you

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,550
know how to post on Facebook I'm just

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,470
see who out there what they're saying

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,760
and everyone saw you find something it's

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,650
like oh yes I agree with you completely

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,500
stalled you do more research about that

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:28,260
we have the same viewpoints so an

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,750
open-air market I mentioned when I met

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,760
grace in 2009 one of the reasons why I

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,110
ended up connecting frigate she was one

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,450
of the few people then there was

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,630
teaching her talking about using social

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,270
media to build relationships which is

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,460
exactly what my whole mindset was the

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:47,820
last two years everybody else is talking

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,179
about how to post content do so it just

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,440
actually fit to follow so I'm going the

00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,650
same thing and every once in a while

00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,570
again I think purposely go after looking

00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,300
for people now that we're looking for

00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,280
I talk about again photography and how

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,030
to use images so the ft short properly a

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:09,660
four month and probably an image sizes

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:11,790
jobs again uh design is a perfect person

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,620
I don't quite follow at this point at

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,080
the medium because we're talking the

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,880
same language and there's a way to me to

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,390
support them as much as for emphasis for

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,950
me so it's pure state math so I can I'm

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,929
just looking for people I can connect to

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,520
it but it work with it there's some

00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:29,520
correlation between businesses so

00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,260
there's relevance so that again when

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,410
you're looking at backlinks if I get

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,350
back from a roof

00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,930
they whether they know let's also meet

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,610
right so he give rules got winner

00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,850
there's no relevance to see why these

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:46,390
two movie linked it starts looking like

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:49,840
after this but photography graphic

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:58,510
design there is a connection so that's

00:32:49,840 --> 00:33:02,290
kind of this so this is about the

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:05,680
networking aspect you put it on a light

00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,530
work to to you know find those

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,110
influencers and write a guest post on

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,110
their sites but they can dictate all

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,240
that effort of a tech your your blade as

00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,300
being a go Father

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,400
so do you I'm wondering do you do you

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,960
son do you say some sort of contract to

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,550
make them say that they're not going to

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,140
do that too so that you just so that the

00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:34,900
internet will still particular follow

00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:36,760
those links your site is there you don't

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,350
and again that's the thought of I'm not

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,810
worried about whether I do actually get

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,520
that link or not so one of the few SEO

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,530
practices when you're hiring somebody

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,510
new best note that I really recommend

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:49,090
especially if you're a larger brand

00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:51,250
you've probably got a lot of mentions is

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,690
looking for lost backlinks or you've

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:58,900
been mentioned on the web somewhere but

00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,370
there's no link to you outside that I

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,290
don't always pay attention if I get away

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,840
even if this even if those links with us

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,280
tomorrow up

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,960
he's so promoting this stuff on social

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,490
media that these are still opportunity

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,350
for my brand that you've found build

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,629
some brand recognition for me

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:16,570
because again to behavior would you show

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:19,750
up in a search later we're more likely

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,280
to click on what the familiar which is I

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,570
am probably going to be critical for

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,100
somebody else because they've seemed to

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,440
me over and over again they've seen it

00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,620
from other influencers or others in the

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,230
industry the rest of that even if it's a

00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:36,040
no following that's still potential

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:37,639
referral from that from their six-month

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,879
so I'm not just king

00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,669
sir peace I'm getting traffic from their

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,139
website director and if any of their

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:48,289
readers are going through them applying

00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,179
it and it could be another industry to

00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:51,319
insert it's possible they for it

00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,730
something without me having done the

00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:54,649
legwork

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,119
so my primary concern is have been

00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:00,109
building in relationship in such a way

00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:04,279
that helps them show my expertise and

00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:33,380
authority gives me content share most of

00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:51,019
the content I find so they're not

00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:54,019
necessarily so sometimes again I'm doing

00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:55,279
this to put my cornea so one of the

00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,779
things we get into is that when we're

00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,690
talking about content we're always like

00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:01,720
yeah

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:04,630
the content on my pages comments are a

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,150
form of context in and of themselves

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,980
they are still published content you're

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,150
simply publishing in somebody else's

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,430
space

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,289
it still means it's highly visible so it

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,640
still has that value pretty important me

00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:17,499
for anyone who sees it

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,859
so if they're a large enough brand

00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:22,660
anyone that has a big following people

00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:24,009
are seeing their concert or likely I'm

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,440
gonna still do it because I still get

00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:29,680
something out okay at least I'm

00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,359
recognized the other piece if I come

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,220
back depending who they are attitude a

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,019
long time to get through work exploited

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,059
I started looking at other stuff too

00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:39,220
posting 15 or their website and you look

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:41,529
who is writing their content and II

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,239
started looking for them on social media

00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:46,059
and I started interacting with them

00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:49,390
personally and because my pager my

00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:50,670
personal profile is set up with a link

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,980
to my business page

00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,930
if I keep their interest especially if

00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,589
your Facebook groups to France can act

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,329
there they come back and see who I am

00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:03,640
and my page they make a connection

00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:05,230
between me and my friend and that gets

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,430
into my page so there are a couple of

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,839
tactics and again I'm not 100% all these

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,180
doing this with the person gain

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,489
backlinks it's the build relationship

00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,849
pieces I just know long term I do this

00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:19,810
and get I'm doing this with 10 15 to 20

00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,180
different

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:27,160
for weeks once we're done with it and it

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,140
should begin building all this social

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,460
media is not like most people worry

00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:36,090
about how much money am I getting from

00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:36,090
where I'm spending it's not an exit say

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:49,810
hey something like you said they tell

00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,970
people to go and read the blog or some

00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,890
new comment and your example around

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,720
facebook was very creative but what

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,780
happens if you put some fresh content

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,880
you know something on your blog you

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,470
don't tweet a link to it you how many

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,800
people find it about people aware of it

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:08,190
who don't currently follow you so one of

00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,530
the pieces actually to put it out on

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:13,300
social media so that I won't I've always

00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,770
said it's creative method i evening it's

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,200
how I'm creating that content and

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,390
putting it out there it goes out on

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
Twitter I actually have microblogs

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,680
Rocchi summarize my blog post enough

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,720
three four hundred Instagram posts where

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,250
it is your posts we're all taking the

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,200
same image that I'm using that will show

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,390
up on Facebook and I'm using back an

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,210
Instagram before basically there are

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,160
some ones so I'm still pushing out there

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm just not telling the face I just

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,560
publish something go reef I'm giving

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,390
another you may need you know so you

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,830
still have market but for some of the

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,260
small folks that are not sure I really

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,210
want to really push hard up so playing

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,590
a little bit so working through some of

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,870
my ideas and I don't publish them I'm

00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:58,480
still working other posts around them to

00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,040
protract it back and then we usually

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,000
have the blog post only did you have any

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,520
previous posts next our staffing or

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:18,220
suggested posts so some of the ways that

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:22,690
I get into my mentioned earlier that

00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,700
that you on Facebook is sometimes the

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,820
same content this any website in a lot

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,010
do you push that out automatically some

00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:36,040
plug-in where you individually go to

00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:37,900
each Facebook and Twitter 90% of all my

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,650
social media content across five

00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,450
platforms is done in real time and the

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,650
same thing and I'm managing five and six

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:50,380
and seven different clients that I

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,210
schedule very little and there a couple

00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,140
reasons for doing so there are specific

00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:58,510
pieces where my core content is updated

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:01,090
as Evan and create a CSV file that I use

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,700
HootSuite upload for Twitter that is

00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,410
generally the extent I may schedule out

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,870
one or two posts so if I publish the

00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,850
blog post on a Sunday evening I may have

00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,430
Facebook post scheduled for Monday

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,500
I usually more than one or two published

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,660
or scheduled at any one time what do you

00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,240
do

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,880
so Facebook intro and I am in Facebook's

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,670
platform every day I am on Twitter every

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:29,170
day I published clients content on

00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:31,090
LinkedIn I have a creditor if I need to

00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,430
keep things a little bit tighter with my

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,040
schedule a lot to create our body that

00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,690
post

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,460
jeanny Leverett that they pull it up to

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,230
my phone if I have to wear my Mac we be

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,860
waiting online somewhere and publish it

00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:46,070
at that time the advantage from me and

00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,990
publishing in real time one I don't want

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,250
to get everything around work camp and

00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,250
I'm gonna let that student voice behind

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,340
local social media content here has been

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:58,310
around an image and a lot of tweets and

00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,650
a lot of scientists it so had there been

00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:03,410
an airline disaster every piece of

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,980
content it skips will be put out in that

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:09,290
year future needs to be axed and if I've

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,880
skimmed the 25 or 30 or tweets over to

00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,370
in three days like Facebook post

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,190
Edgewood that is a nightmare for me when

00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:19,310
I'm sitting here doing something to go

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,610
back and undo so by limiting what's out

00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,820
there

00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,860
I can act a lot faster and means I have

00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,560
fewer problems to deal with reputation

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,080
later and making a mistake

00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,760
it also allows me to react to changes

00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,010
like one of my clients we have concept

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,470
set up that we knew we were to do and

00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,180
have a last minute thing that came out

00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,820
from the client of their the testimony

00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,150
it was huge it created video form we

00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,249
pushed off the other piece of

00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,779
I didn't have to go back in my schedule

00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:49,470
at least it will move things around on

00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:52,980
court battles so it is one it is more

00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:56,640
work but doing the groundwork and

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,740
putting in that time you know results if

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,920
you want to automate everything you take

00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,720
away the relationships the obey is the

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,450
other and the other piece will be really

00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,150
doing that I'm going to come in the

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,950
black box and if I'm using HootSuite or

00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:15,450
closer to the other third party program

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:17,249
to do during my posting I'm over here we

00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,499
tend to not go back to be the networking

00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:21,059
piece but home ready in Facebook it

00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:23,460
takes me five minutes ago just run a

00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,900
quick search or play one on there for

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,869
client and then a move on to the next

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,809
one I can't just forget

00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:32,460
so that 70% of what I have to do you

00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:33,539
know once in that event I'm moving

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,049
through the day it's a lot easier to get

00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:39,869
on my phone let's go blank and so if I'm

00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:43,109
actually in facebook I'm on Twitter I'm

00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:45,480
on LinkedIn I can actually network can

00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:47,549
do there's more me they're not taking

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:56,489
any yet and I haven't see the entire

00:42:47,549 --> 00:43:01,559
picture not just this so sins like you

00:42:56,489 --> 00:43:05,700
do this for other clients and I position

00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:08,339
as a communication manager for usually

00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,650
full-time granny I'm doing for a few

00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:12,780
different people but it sounds like the

00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,870
ideas that means understand

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:19,470
businesses domain to be able to comment

00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:22,920
intelligently influencers site on behalf

00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:25,080
of the company and in that sense you're

00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,120
kind of managing the central social

00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,600
media account and then there's also kind

00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,000
of individuals in the business who also

00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:36,960
have their own social media accounts and

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,480
I imagine that I following your advice I

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,360
encouraged them to go out and make

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,790
similar comments and so I'm just kind of

00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,680
wondering but they the same time to hire

00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,960
you so you'd be the one to do all that

00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,610
stuff for them so they don't have to be

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:57,930
so spending their time marketing so I'm

00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:01,340
just wondering how you do the tension

00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:07,470
between that you as the social media

00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:09,720
voice so that gets the heart of

00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,230
something like played with for several

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,160
years

00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:15,900
I don't do social media manager I don't

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,230
like the term social media management

00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,840
and I've been content for me to work a

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,800
bit clamp the content that would be

00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,810
published they need to provide me

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,270
they're the experts they know it better

00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:33,900
than I do I am NOT going to be able to

00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:36,690
create the authority around them by

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,150
creating my own content portal I look

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,690
for content the more we're doing working

00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,880
together

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,740
I'll see things that some other clients

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,390
that may be evaluating send it to them

00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,940
can we use this is this something you

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,860
want to use and I'll ask them to give me

00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,870
more on it and I will drag it out if I

00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,500
have to and so we're going to share a

00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:57,390
link that I need to drag out of them why

00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,430
we're sharing this link what was it

00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,900
about new reading this article same way

00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,670
I could be neurotic oh that's exactly

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,580
the same for three years I could also do

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,560
this in this thinking if my job is to

00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,990
make sure it gets out published properly

00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,300
and to create how its published or not

00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,640
they're all the same thing it wants and

00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,190
established in this I also make sure I

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,740
work especially larger brands that I'll

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,550
create an employee advocacy program for

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,050
okay

00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,970
and then I will sit down with their

00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,940
staff with something through online

00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:29,700
meetings where this is what we're

00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,280
looking to do that we want you to go

00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,080
interact as yourself we want you to

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,690
share company contact we want you to

00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:40,470
interact on company contact contact and

00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:42,120
anything you see that's invaded identify

00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,040
comment it becomes we go through this

00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,810
list based on what the brand's

00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,200
parameters are what they're willing to

00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:52,110
allow the pillars to do I will do what I

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,020
call basic or limited engagement that

00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,550
there are things I have certainly said

00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,780
they can turn around and ask a question

00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,890
that I haven't actually answered because

00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,410
they're the time to working with a

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,460
client so learning thing for me to I'm

00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,710
learning more and more about other

00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,470
brands and other businesses this way and

00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:10,620
I'm bringing like some like decades of

00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:12,240
experience and other brands so when I

00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,400
get to a point where it's up you say I

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,350
can't answer the question I'll come in

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,960
and practice said will better technical

00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,760
adviser to give us an answer to get back

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,610
to shortly so at least there's a media

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,510
conversation email or text message goes

00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:29,670
up they give me the information behind

00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,990
me plank with them or they say hey we'll

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:37,680
just have work manager log in and

00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:40,170
provide the answer so there's a it's a

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,040
big piece of what I generally can do in

00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:46,050
terms of the networking for them is I

00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,770
will get a list of brands they work with

00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:51,780
or they're interested in or follow where

00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:54,630
we can find content or interact in such

00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:59,430
a way and when possible or we actually

00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:01,200
add comments to it if not the link that

00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,540
Facebook post linked to that tweet of it

00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,060
into your article it sent off in an

00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,800
email or get some

00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,110
whatever messaging clock that we're

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,690
using and I make sure that they know

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:15,980
they have to do this and one big piece

00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:17,870
for me if you listen to all the things I

00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,730
asked you to do get me the content that

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,440
I need from you if you turn on them when

00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,900
you need to interact with somebody and I

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,300
tell you to do it you do it the results

00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:30,110
will be if you're gonna miss stages of

00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:33,170
this yours up together for this and it's

00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:35,810
on them to do so I am not completed

00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,470
tying what they're aiming to do based on

00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,840
results

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,780
it does require them to do this you

00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,430
can't hand off social media which

00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:47,450
relationship-based thing to a third

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:53,990
party have to be involved at leads to a

00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:57,080
plan around us there are the exactly

00:47:53,990 --> 00:48:00,590
they are right again you also know their

00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,910
clients very and you can do the social

00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:06,710
mean for me because you know I think

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:09,130
more and that takes some time some

00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,130
learning

00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:28,770
before these six o'clock

00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:28,770
