Title: Joshua Wold: Contributing to WordPress as a non-developer
Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	11 years. That’s how long I’ve been using WordPress to create websites as a part of design and development teams. 2017 was the first year I started giving any real contribution back to the WordPress project. Before that I tried. I kept looking at this thing called Trac, I even created an account and followed some of the development tickets. But I felt blocked since my primary background is in design. I didn’t know how to get started.
All that changed last year when I was given a unique opportunity by my company to donate time to helping in the make.wordpress.org work. In this talk I’ll share the process I went through from not knowing where to get started, to jumping into a few tickets, to helping lead parts of the work being done in WordPress.
If you’re curious about giving back to WordPress, but don’t have a ton of development experience, then this talk will be for you. Let’s go through this journey together.
