Title: Joshua Wold: Contributing to WordPress as a non-developer
Publication date: 2020-04-10
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	11 years. That’s how long I’ve been using WordPress to create websites as a part of design and development teams. 2017 was the first year I started giving any real contribution back to the WordPress project. Before that I tried. I kept looking at this thing called Trac, I even created an account and followed some of the development tickets. But I felt blocked since my primary background is in design. I didn’t know how to get started.
All that changed last year when I was given a unique opportunity by my company to donate time to helping in the make.wordpress.org work. In this talk I’ll share the process I went through from not knowing where to get started, to jumping into a few tickets, to helping lead parts of the work being done in WordPress.
If you’re curious about giving back to WordPress, but don’t have a ton of development experience, then this talk will be for you. Let’s go through this journey together.

hi everyone and so is my pleasure to

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,000
introduce to you

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:13,910
Joshua wall today so since 2007

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,189
Joshua used WordPress for personal

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,019
projects as a client project over the

00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:20,269
past three years he's been part of the

00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:22,579
team that paged xwp

00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,710
right where he's been able to dive

00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,179
deeply into designing for his clients

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,909
inside a wordpress space

00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,499
fun fact about Joshua he loves to read

00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:34,280
especially audiobooks

00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:35,989
he usually have a dozen dozen open books

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,539
that he's going through it let beefin

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:41,210
rates when he's designing he can easily

00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,940
easily even read the rules which makes

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,160
the entire leader a very fun process and

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,690
today josh is gonna be talking about how

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,239
he got involved in contributing to

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,219
WordPress as a designer he thought about

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,410
it for years and tried several times but

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,570
it has been it always felt like a huge

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,480
barrier finally watched he started

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,309
contributing so it has been a very great

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,320
experience so today he's going to share

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,300
with you how it took to finally get

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,040
started and start and share some of the

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,490
inspiration for ways you can you can do

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,970
all the things thank you so much good

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,970
morning everybody

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:21,350
WordPress core if you've spent any time

00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,850
in it is a great place that you can

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,830
actually get to work on the product

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,710
which is WordPress and help to make it

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,530
better and WordPress is made by people

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,720
who are designers developers marketers

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,440
polyglots people you know can read lots

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,350
of languages writers and if you're

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,360
interested in excess

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,009
ability there's this whole community you

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
can get involved in even if you're not a

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,479
developer and so last year I got to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,540
experience that and I wanted to share

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,680
what that experience was like to

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,560
hopefully inspire others if you're

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,840
interested in getting involved the slide

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,580
link the latest version is right there

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,130
there's person on the website but I

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,960
can't stop messing with the slides taken

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,250
this morning I posted an updated version

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,729
so you see the link right there that's

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,580
my twitter handle and let's jump in as

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,370
mentioned I've been working on WordPress

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,190
as a web designer since 2007 various

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,459
projects and in my background I've also

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,709
been a team lead product owner and just

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,660
worked on a lot of small projects as

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,910
well as larger projects over that time I

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,680
also like to do illustration so you'll

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,630
see some illustrations pop up in the

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,220
slides just kind of fun for me and

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,350
writing and reading

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,940
there's my little family there we live

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,040
in northern Idaho so I flew out this

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,110
morning got up at 3:30 a little bit

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
early but not here that's good

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,640
and a few of the quarterly if you hadn't

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,489
been out there it's quite beautiful out

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,160
there that was about two months ago and

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,720
I try to actually go away from my

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,450
computer every now and then and get out

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
to nature I work at a company called xwp

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,820
and it's remote base so I have worked

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,500
wherever I walk to and we do enterprise

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,120
level development working with

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,670
technology companies to bring their work

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,750
into the WordPress ecosystem working

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,920
with Google on the amp project PWA

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,910
pulminary BigCommerce just trying to

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,010
help bring some of these cool

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,530
technologies into the WordPress space so

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,209
my job as a designer has been trying to

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,250
figure out what does that interface look

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,800
like what should past into technologies

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,590
work and what a lot of companies like to

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,150
say okay we have a cool technology we're

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,160
gonna bring to WordPress with an iframe

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,720
and they think that's something

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,250
innovative ideas so we're trying to help

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,800
them figure out what's the actual way

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,480
that we should integrate into WordPress

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,550
and I XMPP over the last year we've been

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,290
working to the Philip actually UX team

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,630
and practice to figure out the best ways

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,670
to integrate these kind of projects and

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:49,110
the work I have done on these projects

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,410
that XMPP has given me some

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,090
opportunities jump into core because you

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,280
spend a lot of time building out a

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,170
wordpress plugin our feature and you

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,060
think okay maybe we can bring this into

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,690
the core project and we can propose this

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,120
as idea to improve core and what I like

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,860
to do is bring these design sketches and

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,360
files and lockups into all those

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,070
projects this is a good example

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
something I'll drop into a ticket if

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,890
we're talking say hey here's what I

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,970
think the folks would look like I'll

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,859
spend a few minutes on something like

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,209
this and then the designers and

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,209
developers would come together and talk

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,040
about it and what I love about mock-ups

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,850
I talked about this last year at

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,680
WordCamp a Seattle is if I do a quick

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,680
sketch like this and show it to the team

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,169
most of the time I'm wrong or half of

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
the time I'm wrong and that gives me an

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,919
opportunity to say to the developer

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,110
here's what I was thinking

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,310
do you agree with me and they'll say no

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,720
I wasn't thinking that about that's

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,970
perfect cuz now to get on the same page

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,050
so I'd encourage this type of

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,180
interactivity on the projects a lot so

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,640
let's jump into core while here today

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,290
what we're talking about and just

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,730
looking at ways that maybe you could

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,020
bring their own talents and experience

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,430
into the project for five years I've

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,630
been working with my brother at Dennis

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,700
company as well if you've been saying

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,580
hey Justin but keep involving your

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,590
husband

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,210
over there so jump into the sinkhole

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,880
track which is the ticket management

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,380
system in court and I would probably get

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,180
a little welding stuff away it's just

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,720
felt too complicated I didn't how to get

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,430
started and the if I would look at an

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,500
issue I've see all these really smart

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,150
people talking about it and I thought

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,460
like I didn't have much to contribute so

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:32,890
I walk away in 2016 I got my first real

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,350
opportunity working on a client project

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,100
who here has heard of the customizer in

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,040
WordPress

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,660
a couple of perfect mashallah a

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,580
screenshot of what it looks like care

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,710
and moment the customizer is a feature

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,650
in WordPress that allows you to see your

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,290
website live while also managing some

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,430
options in the sidebar and with one of

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,640
our clients or even a bunch of

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,680
customizer related work and you can see

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,210
if you appear here's my website and on

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,490
the side there's some buttons there and

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,740
I can change maybe the colors it might

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,270
be allows me to or play around move

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,980
around objects player that make music

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,480
cetera so we were trying to do some

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:13,000
demand stuff to make the customizer

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,740
better and this is a sketch that one of

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,230
my co-workers sent me and said hey

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,730
that's what we want to try to bring save

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,410
me and publishing into the customizer

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,360
the one trying to figure out a way to do

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,950
that so he sent this to me and I frankly

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,610
had no idea what this was about to be I

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:29,140
don't want to call talk about then what

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,390
I was able to do is spend some time

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,300
working with my colleagues on figuring

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,920
out okay if I have something

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,350
how would I be able to save a draft to

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,510
submit to my editor how would I be able

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,220
to leave it here and not mess up the

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,810
website and a lot of production version

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,550
but still see what my content would look

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,280
like so I started to work on some

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:57,170
sketches of that will it back and forth

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:59,870
and kept going kept going and throughout

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:04,760
this process I'm able to work on this

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,160
really hard feature that I can you guess

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,240
this at akkad very very convoluted but I

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,800
think we'll work on this really hard

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,030
feature in the customizer without

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,500
writing a line of code I was able to

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,360
work with the head architect work with

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,520
the team lead and we were able to try to

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,020
figure out okay if a million people are

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,940
going to start using this what's the

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,940
best safest way to allow saving and

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,950
publishing to happen so finally I got to

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,730
this point and I thought I was done okay

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,440
this is pretty good

00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,300
I can submit something for a review I

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,980
can save a draft I can schedule it and

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,300
this is all meant little customize a

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,400
button up there I was proud of that as I

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,380
was very happy but then I got some

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,000
feedback I think it was a bell or Weston

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,430
on the ticket they said there's some

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,890
reasons why I wasn't gonna work so I had

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,480
to go back to the drawing board and let

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,340
the simple sketch again and I'm gonna go

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,630
all that fancy work of laying that out

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,580
and I said hey here's what I'm thinking

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,500
what if we had hover over the bottom

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,380
changes color if you click on it maybe

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,630
I'll say saving and then saved and we

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,370
just kept talking about it at that point

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,600
Mac's got really busy or some client

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,610
works like a step away and stopped

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,080
working on this feature and Mel one of

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,060
the designers in course he was able to

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,250
finish it up and it actually got shipped

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,470
so now this is part of the core a save

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,400
and publish feature and if you look at

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,590
it today you'll see it's a little bit

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,360
different than these sketches but I was

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,009
looking to

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,539
this whole process has able to really

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,460
help you move it forward and talk about

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,259
I think they worked on this for about

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,939
eight months it was you can see most of

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:30,639
the record of the ticket if you look at

00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:32,550
it so in 2017 our company did something

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,829
that I thought was pretty cool for me

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,360
they said hey Joshua for the next four

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:38,500
months we're gonna sponsor your time

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,620
just to go work out before anything

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,180
whatever the heck you want and I got

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,430
spent a little bit of time each week and

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,950
then just jump in

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,269
well I knew about them to safely publish

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,380
stuff into customized or anything that

00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,940
I've been able to make an impact there

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,350
so I thought let me see what else I can

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,029
do what are some other areas that I

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,410
could work on there's a little thing

00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,480
called Gutenberg you're starting to take

00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,620
off and get a lot of traction so it's

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,630
sort of jumping into those tickets

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,850
probably the biggest reason I jump to

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,769
the Gutenberg is because if you work

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,079
with technology it's being developed on

00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:10,029
something called github versus track and

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,529
I could understand it have a lot easier

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,170
says able to jump into all the tickets

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:17,709
and start hearing design feedback and so

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,300
this is the pump for me is I was able to

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,870
follow this software project that is

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,089
very complex and has so many pieces that

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,100
I don't understand from a technology

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,079
standpoint or development standpoint but

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,940
I can look at it and say here's what's

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,350
going on and if you put a button here

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,029
and move this wrap here I think it'll be

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,480
better and that's where I was able to

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,860
contribute and give some feedback all my

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,690
feedback and here's some of the issues I

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,570
worked on that four month period was

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,760
comments questions sketches that

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,440
basically what I was doing and I was

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,000
able to help move some of these issues

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,269
forward and help solve some of these

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,420
problems that we were having this is one

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,579
of the ones that I first worked on with

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,529
the Guttenberg and they're talking about

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,970
what we could do with the insert make it

00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,980
a little bit more friendly and useful

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,250
and you can go check out the issue there

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,720
to see you follow the discussion and

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,410
this one was the save and publish just

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,029
one another stage of it that

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,800
so before where I was trying to figure

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,759
out how the buttons working what the

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,069
plot would look like and what I love

00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,110
about something like core and these

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:23,300
projects is if you can bring sketches

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,069
and comments and feedback to an issue

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,810
you can help bringing designers and

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,660
developers together to agree on what's

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,769
being discussed they can say okay I see

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,120
Josh for these spent a little bit of

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,529
time on a sketch like this so let's talk

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,939
about I disagree with the five of the

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,269
things out here but I agree with the

00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:42,259
rest that you have and that helps get

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:44,720
helps move this work forward I wrote an

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,730
article last year on our xmpp website

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,230
about my experience which is kind of

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,850
what inspired me to do this talk just

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,709
hey here's what I think we'll do here's

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,019
the work I think was doing before and in

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,089
2018 I wanted an opportunity to spend a

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,610
little bit more time and to do some more

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,709
work I got the invited to be a team rep

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,870
on design tennis court which basically

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,339
means I hope some of the meetings take

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,930
notes and try to bring a little

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,509
structure to the work that all of these

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,250
amazing volunteers are doing every day

00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:15,880
and that's been a lot of fun for the

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:19,279
last couple of months and the summer

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,959
this was actually a pretty scary thing

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,990
for me I got to lead a release of

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,790
WordPress at my release with Paul Byron

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,310
as the developer and this was at a

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,949
moment where several of us in the design

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,750
community we thought this was very

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,360
important to have someone code even a

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,970
releases not a developer and that meant

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,560
we really believe people have something

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,230
to contribute to court even if they're

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,490
not writing lines of code and to be

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,250
frank there's some things I have no idea

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,930
what we're doing

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,280
I'd say hey Paul what's going on here

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,810
what are we going to do and then if you

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,350
would ask me for help and together we're

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,000
able to put the event release down at

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,110
the bottom I think in all of my work

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,970
I've read maybe 200 purpose one poem was

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,860
not even that I read me how do I suggest

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,290
a little grammar fix and push that lack

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,990
but all the rest has been comments and

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,370
sketches and questions and then more

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,560
recently I've started work on some work

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,110
with Google animals that's a client

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,820
project at Google but that is open

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,600
source as well and some of it is trying

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:22,530
to pull it to WordPress and relate to it

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,910
right now I haven't listened to the

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,140
slide the last moment that's why it's

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,510
changed because I thought this would be

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,940
relevant just this little thing called

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,930
Convergys about to be released maybe in

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,330
a couple of weeks we hope or not and

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:40,530
it's been I was asked to try to figure

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,930
out what the flow should be if you're

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,240
about to upgrade and you have to convert

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,550
plug-in installed or the classic editor

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,920
plug-in itself or no plug-in what should

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,720
come up maybe 100 million people the

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,890
experience what should they see what

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,110
should the bottoms look like the

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,740
interface looks like so I've been

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,940
working on this issue for 5:07 3 along

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,380
with I did I have checked it

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,760
there's thing in court called props

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,870
where you give everyone props that we're

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,300
kind of ticket I think there's been

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,589
about two dozen people so far getting

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,080
involved in this issue because it's

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,810
really important what will people see

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,160
what's its kind of look like so as

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,710
people start out that conversation by

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,120
saying ok here's what I think the

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,760
interface will look like here's the path

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,990
that I think we'll see if I have no

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,270
plugin or if I have this plug-in

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,230
installed and then one of the first

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,100
things that happens is one of my

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,780
co-workers

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,830
looks at what I said well here's all the

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,170
things we need to change about it so I

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,960
red line the whole thing and then I

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,810
posted this one thing last week this is

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,070
the most recent one and this is still an

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,210
ongoing discussion we're trying to solve

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,730
this problem there what should I be

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,710
telling people hey Guttenberg that hurts

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,970
you try a classic Enya well that sounds

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,010
really scary that's something we have no

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,140
faith in just work but do we ignore

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,910
talking about classic Edgar you know we

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,589
probably shouldn't so if any of you guys

00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,940
want to hop in you can actually get

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:03,300
feedback right now that we're trying to

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,209
solve this problem today another one

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,230
that I started last week along with

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,900
other people who've been thinking about

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,940
this as well as in Gutenberg this new

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,280
tool called the block navigator where

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,010
you can tap between blocks and we'll

00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,420
show you they're nested blocks your

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,010
columns so if you have two columns they

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,320
will say a paragraph is in here it's a

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,350
very useful feature but it's hidden up

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,420
there in a little pop-up and if you are

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,580
trying to use it a lot keeps closing on

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,530
you so I proposed I think on Thursday or

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,450
Friday what if we put into a sidebar and

00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,490
then one of our the other folks in

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,500
course of little sidebar problematic for

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,480
these reasons so right now this is I

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,430
just posted update think two hours ago

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,720
it's could you some feedback if any

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,520
you're interested you can jump in and

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,410
say hey Joshua I think that's a horrible

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,290
idea or I think that's great was trying

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,120
to since them these are real tickets

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,560
real issues right now that anybody is

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,810
welcome to jump in and get feedback on

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,790
that's actually it's a little bit of

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,980
digging that if you just go look around

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,990
and see I usually will type into them

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,910
things looking for design feedback now

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,130
start giving my ideas and feedback and

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,820
jump across a bunch of issues it's a lot

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:12,480
of fun so some practical steps if you're

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,650
interested in getting involved these are

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,170
things I've been able to do for the last

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,060
year and a half over different projects

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,650
and with food and bird and track and

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,560
I've actually been able to make a small

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,190
difference on some key issues of

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,379
WordPress

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,269
I've had some feature come out

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,529
that I thought that I got actually

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,910
contribute to that button but it looks

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:34,499
like a what a seven that was a very

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,239
positive experience for me the first

00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,189
thing that I'd like to tell people is if

00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,439
you're interested there's a couple

00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:45,629
meetings that happen every week in court

00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:47,129
you hop on a slack and it all happens in

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:49,229
the slack channel so you're not actually

00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,489
on a hangout or a live call and you can

00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:53,699
just see what we're talking about this

00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:55,369
is from two minutes ago in core people

00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,869
are talking about the lease space

00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:59,579
features we're going to work on with

00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:01,919
what the component maintainers are doing

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,689
and then the design channel we're

00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,429
talking about what is the design team

00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:07,019
supposed to focus on this week what are

00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:09,659
things people need help with how can we

00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,909
help them and then I think there's 15

00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,609
other teams there's 30 other channels

00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:16,979
there's lots of places you can jump in

00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:19,799
it can feel overwhelming so I like to

00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:21,720
say just pick up pick an area that

00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,819
sounds interesting to you if you go to

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,659
make that wordpress.org there's the

00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,739
design team

00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,049
there's the marketing team the

00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:29,220
accessibility team all these teams need

00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:31,679
to just jump in and start attending

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,209
their meetings and what I've found is if

00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,519
you attend those meetings you can

00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:38,100
usually say hey I'm new I've never done

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,899
this before where can I help and there's

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,699
also listen to be someone that will say

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,189
we've got a meeting right now that

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,929
they'd love some feedback and that's

00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,850
what I did I basically just volunteered

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,039
myself and I started actually working

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,439
with some of the people in the design

00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,179
team I started talking to Tami and mal

00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:56,369
and now we've got several new folks over

00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,789
the last year and we became a little bit

00:16:56,369 --> 00:17:01,350
of a team that understood each other

00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:03,539
then if you're gonna build they're brave

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,000
you can hop into track or get up and

00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,980
this is where everything related to

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,659
WordPress and brick gets built you can

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,879
actually just go read tickets and get

00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,579
your feedback not to have a count for

00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:15,789
each of these

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,429
when I get any comments but it for me is

00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,380
a fun thing to do on some tickets

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,059
I find another chlorine middle father

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,529
giving anything back because I have

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,589
nothing to say but there's a lot of ones

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:30,720
I actually bring some of my own advice

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,720
and experience too

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,250
for me I was asking my teen like why do

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,590
you contribute to WordPress whatever

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,630
reasons they need to do that and some of

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,929
the answers I got bird or here you get

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,789
to do something cool they're affecting

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:48,610
32% now of the Internet the work that

00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,620
you're touching and you get to unravel a

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,389
whole bunch of spaghetti problems that

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,039
are all related and interrelated and

00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:56,610
it's actually it's a lot of fun it's a

00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,610
big challenge

00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,610
all that said while this this is a very

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,200
positive experience I think there's just

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,179
a few cautions that I want to tell

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,750
people before they get involved just to

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:13,059
give them a heads up for one if you

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,669
spend much time in core you will find

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,230
that sometimes people aren't all

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,360
positive sometimes you get negative

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,559
responses or someone might say why are

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,559
you doing this this isn't helpful good

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,669
we got there and in general people were

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,899
leaving out these things we're trying to

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,580
fix that we're trying to make sure

00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:30,730
people have more positive and kind and

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,370
helpful responses but if that happens

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,809
don't be dismayed is it's just people on

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,549
the internet all trying to talk and help

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,769
each other and sometimes we're not all

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,480
as employed as we should be there's also

00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:42,429
language barriers we are an

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,260
international community where people all

00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,840
around the world we have timezone

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,669
barriers the other issue that I think

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,250
actually discourages people the most is

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,140
they'll say hey I really cared about

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,480
this issue and I

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,580
watch me back and yes you just have

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,890
still for two years nothing happened or

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,290
this issue I've been following asthma

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,510
has been and there's been comments on

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,480
track for eight years in a mountain town

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,740
that can be a little bit discouraging

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,300
the answer that I would give is

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,460
WordPress it's been described as a

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,560
meritocracy not a democracy

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,700
meaning the best ideas rest the top

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,400
people who are willing to step forward

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,410
and help can push ideas forward so just

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,640
because I have an idea I care about in

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,590
that mind you can write up a perfect

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,900
description does not mean it will happen

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,000
I haven't understand who is leaving out

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,680
that part of the project and I need to

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,890
understand what the priorities are of

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,690
the entire core team and to get the work

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,860
out doing a lot she'll like that

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:42,900
and then the other thing I would say is

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,340
they'll just be off on their own if

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,530
you're going to do many work in court

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,290
try to find one of the leads of a

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,060
project or or like a buddy or a mentor

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,330
and say hey I really care about this

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:57,420
project what can I do and that's what

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,370
happened to me Tammy from the timid

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,020
Lester she has been amazing of just

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,970
giving me feedback it's a huge actually

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,320
work on this or I don't bother about

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,000
this right now it's not a priority and

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,220
that kind of communication has been

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,970
really helpful when I don't have a ton

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,740
of time to invest every week the so that

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:19,260
that's for the costumes the other thing

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,850
I'd like to share is for individuals we

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,400
don't usually have a lot of time just to

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,340
go into the project we have jobs or we

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,680
have live tweet or busy good things if

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,000
you follow something think I shared you

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,650
could probably get your foot in the door

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,680
to figure out what's going on and give

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,900
some feedback and often as some people

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,990
make a big impact just spending about

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,940
five hours a week or like Bill attend a

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,530
meeting and the mid feedback from honor

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,140
to ticket so we can move those forward

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,060
they're part of the team the other thing

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,220
I encourage is if you work at a

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,169
technology company or software company

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,809
or product company that

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,210
WordPress it would actually benefit them

00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,519
to donate some of their employee time to

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,830
the project that's what my company has

00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,359
done where they've invested anywhere

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,220
from one to ten people out of time

00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,200
working on core in different areas

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,029
because we actually had total build a

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,980
software that helps our clients lives

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:13,259
get better so I try to encourage people

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,700
maybe talk to your company maybe see if

00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,149
they didn't donate some of your time as

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,779
well to this project and it's something

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:25,799
that if I was talking to someone

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:28,109
recently people don't realize how few

00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,359
people work on this project I think

00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:33,269
there's a couple dozen designers at the

00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,359
most to give some part-time support to

00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:39,899
the entire WordPress project and there's

00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:42,179
maybe five or six that are able to spend

00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:44,789
full or based part time on the project

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,139
other than that that's kind of it

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,210
there's not too many people actually

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,919
building this amazing piece of software

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,499
that we all get to use so I try to

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,960
encourage you if you are a designer or

00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:56,159
if yourself is not a developer as I

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,289
thought I feel it's not that I have to

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,789
be back on you can make a big impact in

00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:02,279
there just by jumping in and spending a

00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:03,389
little bit of time here's a couple of

00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,950
articles and on

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:09,480
I had reference earlier the link to it

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,759
of one every month twice a month there's

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,009
a meeting for people who is their first

00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,450
time you can just jump in and hear what

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:18,450
I'm contributing to talk to people and

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,249
say here I was at my first time and then

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,779
if you go to make as I mentioned on

00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,850
wordpress.org you can find a team that

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,899
you want to join and then one of my

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,730
co-workers wrote this article in 2016

00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:33,749
Jeff logs actually led multiple releases

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,970
now I think you listen twelve ways you

00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:38,009
can contribute toward press 1 which is

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,779
coding and I'm not trying to downplay

00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,210
the importance of that the product

00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,250
literally does not get built

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,750
you have developers making it I'm just

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,690
trying to say there's other areas and

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,890
people who can contribute then the last

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,299
thing is today throughout the entire day

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,640
actually the room right over there is

00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,020
the contributor room you can go right in

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,090
there and talk to someone and say hey

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,730
this is my first time on contributing

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,380
what can I do or I don't know where to

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,240
spend my time what can I do I've

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,380
attended I think to contributed days so

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,880
far and love them.i we spent six hours

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,350
sketching up a bunch of ideas for

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,899
improving a part of the wordpress

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,490
interface that was really cool there's

00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:18,919

this time I actually feel quite quick I

00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:24,470
don't spend a lot of time on this talk

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:27,490
