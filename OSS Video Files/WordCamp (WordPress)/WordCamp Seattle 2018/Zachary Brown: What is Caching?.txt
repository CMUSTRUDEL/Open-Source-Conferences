Title: Zachary Brown: What is Caching?
Publication date: 2020-04-12
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Caching is critical to the functioning of the modern web. From CDNs to browser caching to DNS TTLs to the WordPress object and full page cache, caching can be a confusing and challenging topic. With Google emphasizing site performance in the latest page rank algorithm changes, it is a topic we canâ€™t afford to ignore. This talk will explain caching in layman terms (with some power-user pro-tips sprinkled throughout) and will give actionable advice on how to make caching work for any site. We will cover the tools available and how to use them effectively and where it might be worth spending money to get better results.

Brown as the director of systems

00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,510
engineering at enough where he helps

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,460
companies and organizations scale and

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,260
secure board president the previous

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,450
lights act that was masters degree in

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,029
meteorology from North Carolina State

00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,100
University it was important working with

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:42,590
us wife and two kids sometimes his wife

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:45,100
in every can all right thank you

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,650
get down in the homestretch here today

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,470
hey alright so I'm gonna talk about

00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,510
caching which is a topic near and dear

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,600
to my heart I've made a career out of

00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:05,930
doing what caching is and how to

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:08,840
implemented websites this is no joke the

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,620
purpose of this talk is to talk in basic

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,290
terms what caching is so that at the end

00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,970
of it you understand what the terms are

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,310
the different layers we don't like a

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,810
sinead how it's important to help your

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,330
site and understand these terms going

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:32,410
forward it comes up a bit so base

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,410
knowledge how to look at this what

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,780
we're not going to get into super detail

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:43,460
thank you . for solving specific

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,680
problems with caching when i started

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,200
putting together this presentation I'm

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,030
like oh god I've made a terrible mistake

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,690
this is way too broad of the topic I

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,690
don't know what I was thinking

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:28,290
okay right so this is me we have already

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:33,130
here systems engineering high scale

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,020
enterprise clients Portland it slightly

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,570
on my website I'll put that up again as

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:43,960
well alright so catching some of the

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:49,210
basic definition if you google caching

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:52,960
definition you will get this score way

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:59,110
thank you or future use not sure that's

00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:03,400
really so we'll take a look at the word

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,800
mortgages the word word test office from

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,630
a French Canadian fur trappers they use

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,200
this word to refer to place they would

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,730
store their deer store extra supplies in

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,190
clearing people or an out in the

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,950
wilderness for weeks on end they would

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,860
travel for days down rivers across

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,970
mountains into place they were trapping

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:29,980
be burgers mean and then we have there

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:31,390
for a long time doing their work they

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,040
would need to carry a lot of supplies

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,000
with them they didn't want to prepare us

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
every day

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,560
perhaps absolutely its storage somewhere

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,819
it's come back to you later

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:50,840
rather this going all the way back to

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:53,480
staff right and there were seven so they

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,939
were storing this material at a place

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,989
they could get to it more quickly and

00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,989
more conveniently

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:08,419
so one Wikipedia is an expansion of this

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,290
definition and it talks about how the

00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:14,599
word is used in your science it's

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,060
hardware software component the stores

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,539
data as a future request for that yet be

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,829
served

00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:25,639
faster the Venus Gordon cash might be

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:29,360
the result of earlier work that was Tom

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,330
occasionally expected and it's a copy so

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,610
you can get to it more so we see the

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,009
fact that similar to the word word in

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,830
right into place where you can store

00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:44,199
something and start it faster more

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,199
efficiently and more conveniently

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,630
explain this let's look at us how

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,630
request you serve

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:14,180
so there's person

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,660
they figure URL on a browser that

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,210
request hops across that was tens of

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,760
thousands of miles potentially on cables

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:32,450
going under the ocean to the server

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:34,889
where you post Messer lives in one place

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,419
so this is your hosting environment we

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:41,820
recycle lives so WordPress receives that

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,830
URL and then it's going to run some

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,840
subset of the four hundred thousand

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,010
lines of PHP code to make up WordPress

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,690
this is not including plugins or themes

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,750
some subset of that 100 thousand lines

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,669
of code to run to figure out where

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,330
should what games should be served for

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,419
this URL

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,210
what is this person requesting how is

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:09,060
the will of what data he's gonna be

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:11,729
showing on this page these requests to

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,590
database if the content all the things

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,229
you bring all your data is in the

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,820
database that gets their turn to

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:24,390
WordPress the code runs on this

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:27,620
WordPress builds an HTML page that

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,490
includes all of the images and CSS

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,289
JavaScript the other stuff that goes

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:37,440
into page builds HTML file sends all

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,850
that data back across flyers to a person

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,300
to person together

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,430
peter is thrilled because they realize

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:52,200
how many complicated things had to

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:57,060
happen for that site to live so here is

00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,240
how WordPress site happens we think

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,120
about our and definition here about

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,330
trying to serve something faster or some

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:13,230
computationally expensive thing they

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:15,990
actually refer to quickly we think about

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,420
where you would put this cache so that

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:24,030
it would be quicker to serve this site

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:27,780
to the user so what if we put a layer of

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,780
caching right here this is called full

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,210
page cache this is when you put a layer

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,240
caching at the very front of your

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,090
hosting environment so that when

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,190
WordPress serves an HTML page to that

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,630
user after it is built the entire thing

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,580
and done those hundreds of database

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,060
queries and thousands of lines of code

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,670
and add an HTML page will just store the

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,920
HTML page and the next person who asks

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,340
for the HTML page will just give them a

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,990
pea

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,890
you won't have to build everything with

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,490
WordPress and databases and everything

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,660
no this is great when you have a

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,880
publishing site right your newspaper

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,770
blog your marketing site right

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,620
everything does the same

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,810
you get everybody have all the paper

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,539
glassed-in same page nothing you need

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,300
going right here so there's no reason

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,759
you have to run all the coded WordPress

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,650
and all of that logic to build that into

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,280
the same page just send another HTML

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,280
type again

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:37,500
so this cuts out all of this work this

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,810
is great because it's super fast now you

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,510
have to do all that work nor website can

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,550
serve those HTML pages super fast it's

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,100
very efficient you can do this on a

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,950
really small server but very little

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:55,560
resources to serve any demo page and

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:56,870
it's very skilled you an idea how all

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,880
this makes something

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,690
imagine this is the amount of data in

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,820
your website yeah it serve at a given

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,680
time it doesn't matter how many people

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,440
are coming to your website and folks is

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,770
only so big those nozzles are only so

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,899
big that's as much water as you can push

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,180
through that website no matter what are

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,700
you there's no more games coming out of

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:26,660
there

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,660
that's fine what a great luck

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:34,990
daily voltage cashing your website from

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:40,100
a host like this to something like this

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:42,800
like I this is no joke it is hundreds of

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:48,820
thousands of times the more efficient to

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:54,920
serve just HTML pages I've worked on

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,670
large sites where they're hosting it

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,270
across

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,339
well 15 servers struggling to keep up

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:05,000
every time they get lots of traffic the

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:06,440
site goes down it crashes they can't

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,310
keep up with entertained cuts of money

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,880
for hosting enable very simple homepage

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:19,190
matching on the site and we preserved in

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:23,230
two or three servers easily it really

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,230
makes a huge difference

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:35,209
all right so those are the benefits and

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,160
there are some gotchas to be aware of

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,089
and this isn't an exhaustive list that

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,800
these are kind of the big ones one thing

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,620
to consider is okay

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,589
I'm saving this request after WordPress

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,350
has created it what happens when I

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,910
publish new content I changed the title

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:59,060
of that article so that's the okay

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,180
different work how does that get updated

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,100
in Makassar there's a state version of

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,120
it you can change it over here my house

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,920
the Castro family to divert it also I've

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,780
teamed to peddle that and that title is

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,240
also on my home page of the archive page

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,160
through the related posts thing over

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,160
here I need that to be updated

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,690
everywhere in the second question is

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,270
what kind of site to deal with the

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,310
content like you have commerce site and

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,920
plate press I can be logged in and

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,430
they're seeing their specific friend

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,750
activity list things like that

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,870
so the first point what happens when

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:44,260
there's new content there's two ways to

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:47,390
handle it you could just wait longer

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,400
when we set up the full page cache the

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,860
way you do it is you set the expiration

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,880
time or those pages when they're in the

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,800
gap five minutes or ten minutes you can

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,290
this is a super simple way to set it up

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,250
they set up to just be it's five or ten

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,980
minutes and

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,260
you're blessed for WordPress and then

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,390
you'll get your updates there so you

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,790
just have to wait and this is funny

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:16,380
because this is a very simple thing to

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,360
do it really really scalable but people

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,010
don't like this they want to push the

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,180
button publish the thing and they let

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,710
everyone to see if they want to tweet

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,880
about it immediately they don't want it

00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:29,420
to be on a delay this is a way to do it

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,480
if you can throw out the old page and

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,180
refresh it with the new page this is

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,760
what happens when you just integrated

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,010
with WordPress and this can be

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,310
integrated using any number of WordPress

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:49,350
plugins and the way that work is when

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:52,370
you publish a new post it fires up on

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:56,130
saving the most to attachment system a

00:12:52,370 --> 00:13:01,620
caching system knows all the places with

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:04,410
that post title or the metadata shows up

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,440
and it clears selectively all of those

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,820
pages from full page cache and now you

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,700
have a new version and it's available

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:16,080
instantly so this is a pretty well solve

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:20,750
the problem and have WordPress plugins

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,750
that do this so this is

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,000
we'll have that intelligent query so

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,420
whatever your site deals with you need

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,950
time to enter a user well it's not

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,550
really useful page asking for this

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,250
that's not this time it really relies on

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:46,660
every page being the same

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,120
that's sir so we've got ecommerce site

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,430
buddypress for something where the big

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,010
server from the server is different for

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,310
every user becomes Candida prefer if you

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:01,510
are coming for page you'll want to look

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:05,920
at something different so in that case

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,070
we will remove the page - there's

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,830
something to take advantage over here

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:19,390
there's object dashing which exists

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:22,840
right here it is a place to store the

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,370
results of database queries or some

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,670
complicated things are happening

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:32,480
WordPress you don't

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:36,860
to do so we generally would use a

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,330
software tool like memcache or Redis and

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,760
those are key value stores which is

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,620
illustrated here basically really simple

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,990
databases they don't have anything

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,880
that's going on it's just their key and

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:59,850
there's a value and you can value that's

00:14:50,880 --> 00:15:02,370
related to key entry this way rather

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,150
than minus QL there's like give me

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,100
things in the most better table for this

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,400
post I came to join the most benefit

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:15,350
ball with those table and only tell me

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:19,830
things from October 3rd October 5th and

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,930
things that were written by Julie that

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,360
can be very difficult for the database

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,130
that they comply all those rules if you

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:33,570
have that done in the cache we just be

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:36,450
sitting somewhere in one place we use

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:41,160
object caching a lot is let's say you

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:44,910
have a site that relies on api's we work

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,230
with the financial financial news

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:53,180
talking about stock prices down dividend

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:55,980
stocks in their articles they have a

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,260
they make sure to stock the elected with

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,860
the stock ticker name and the correct

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:06,110
price of that stuff so that populates

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,570
all the way through your site now

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,190
happens to be fairly expensive to make

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,430
these calls to the same guy this

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:17,640
financial data so every time you love

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,130
site we don't necessarily want to have

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,350
to you know update that a particular

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,480
price every single page load that's

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,240
gonna be a very expensive if they have a

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,380
popular article and it doesn't need to

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,510
be updated every second right so in the

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,580
object caching after the first page move

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,130
where that Alice Tavistock price is

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,230
loading we store that value and we have

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,360
ten cash

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,010
on the next page load we don't have to

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,260
make any technical to get that Apple

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,360
stock price it's sitting right there in

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,810
the object we'll just pull it right from

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,010
there where the fifteen minutes are up

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,160
then that means loads you'll see that

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,529
value has expired only thing you call

00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,830
the guy and refreshing cash with that

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:04,199
Apple stock price so this way it saves

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:09,449
us money man make that API call and

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:13,020
eight guys I don't control guys it could

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,610
be slow I don't want this page would you

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,829
come up halfway through you're waiting

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,250
for this API coming the app won't stop

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:23,100
price if I have in my updated - I know I

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,780
have it somewhere that I could refer to

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,780
it sort of quickly and reliably

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,080
let's see so the benefits of this when

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,260
you turn it on it's generally pretty

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,010
invisible WordPress works right out of

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:48,970
the box without catching many popular

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,870
plugins have good data caching and

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,309
integration that term work best - you

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,809
have to catch you on if you have it

00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:59,640
where it's all belonging to do it and

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:02,740
looks exactly the same great

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,120
it doesn't through scalability right and

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,690
you turn it on and it's probably not

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,670
gonna be kicking do it faster a high

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:25,900
scale if you're doing a lot of complex

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:28,390
things okay so back to the publisher

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:33,820
sites where we take you into captioning

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:35,530
so that puts us here so this is great

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,559
we're serving items out of the bulk page

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:42,460
cache we're not doing any of a full

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,700
workload WordPress every time well you

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:50,020
still have all those wires to go across

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,750
and that can be sort of up especially if

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,429
you're hosting a site and GoDaddy and

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,260
the other server in Dallas and the

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:59,240
person factory

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,030
Australian that's a long way for that

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,380
less to go questions be a blank it does

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:09,950
take a little while so what we did some

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,400
caching and this layer much closer to

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:16,730
the actual user who's requesting that

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:21,290
data so this is called a content

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:24,100
delivery network or CDN a CDN global

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,700
network of servers that you can ping

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,720
ping company to store your data on their

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,740
servers and serve it to their local

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,060
customers on word wrestling in general

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,800
[Music]

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:43,190
and you've got a way to do this what we

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,990
do store your images on the CDN so

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,950
they're very large a twelve down though

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,530
is whether that's key and restore that

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:55,640
server that globally distributed you can

00:19:51,530 --> 00:20:04,310
use to quickly serve serve that those

00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:09,130
images to apply so the illustration that

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:13,340
looks like let's say there's a very

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:18,470
exciting and here's two people razzing

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,300
the same one only New York resident

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:31,820
Melbourne chose to go the long way

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:36,020
around the long way right so if you had

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,700
this beginning played here you have

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,130
servers all over the place and the

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,500
person of Melbourne would be making a

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,330
request to a server in Sydney and the

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,080
person in New York would be state

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,780
request to a server in New York and you

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,120
would reduce all that latency of traffic

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,840
of that request

00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:02,020
all the wives and there's some of the

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:04,929
provider have hundreds of servers to

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:08,590
your visitors so there's two main types

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:12,820
of CBN's the georgian poles you can and

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:17,260
reverse proxies begins on important

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,659
pulse again you would have your URL of

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:24,610
the my site which is your wordpress site

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:28,960
if you have a separate domain such as

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:34,000
cen my site calm viewpoint acts against

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:38,649
company's servers you can use a

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,100
wordpress plugin generally to unpack the

00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:45,100
rewrite all the urls for your images CSS

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:51,789
or javascript files to go to the end of

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:54,820
my site while the ink requests or my

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:57,309
site so when they're the best going to

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,049
see en mi site back top if the seed is

00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:01,720
already attached your image would just

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:06,279
serve it we ended it happen really

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:10,270
quickly it's not their CDN makes request

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,760
back to your main website and pull that

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,159
image in catches it and serves it to

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,039
that person so the next person can get

00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,320
that image it's really very transparent

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:23,559
and easy to do and will make a big

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,909
difference in how fast these things are

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,650
certain so the CDN request those two

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:33,010
right there the local TV yet

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:35,080
my site as I said gives wires and

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,710
tunnels and under the ocean and through

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,480
whole fiber-optic or copper cables

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,010
applied to the WordPress so exist

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,160
there's a big difference in what's going

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,260
on with the request here the reverse

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,940
proxy CDN is actually what I see more

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,390
authentic would be what I would

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:58,440
recommend using if you were getting

00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:03,310
started how this works is that your

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,800
requests where site done top goes first

00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:09,460
to CDN doesn't go right to earth as it

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:14,400
goes to the CDN works the same way where

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:17,880
it serves firewalls movies you know

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,560
audio file all those things like that

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,460
but because all of your traffic is going

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,980
to see not only can you use this layer

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:31,210
caching here you can apply security

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:34,840
rules without patient fire if you think

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:38,340
they're optimized images on the fly you

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,340
can even do both these matching

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,810
now some of these events are allowing

00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,530
you to run from JavaScript without their

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:51,280
servers act the C Network which I've

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:52,930
seen applied to innovative things things

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,220
that are changing the content on the

00:23:52,930 --> 00:24:03,070
page

00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:07,570
librarian request a dollar sign that

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,120
they have to you know JavaScript before

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,890
that request ever gets to WordPress

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:19,900
so WordPress doesn't have to do anything

00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:20,980
about all that kind of stuff so yeah so

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,260
that's the difference you don't have to

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,170
use a separate domain it's it's a

00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,090
completely between the browser and your

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:32,920
site you just don't hide all these wires

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:43,000
way far away but there's a CDN in

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:48,340
between ok so we're back to our diagram

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,700
here so we'll change the label to this

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,670
view a full page caching right as things

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:59,590
come out of our hosting environment and

00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:04,050
now we can see yet cached images and

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:08,290
possible pages very close to the user

00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:11,170
the last time I talked about actually

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:14,440
happens on your computer in the browser

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:18,790
so this is the best now we're going to

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:21,980
make requests to you anywhere together

00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:27,380
actually your browser itself will save

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:29,990
these files which that's definitely the

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,850
fastest way to serve it to go to make

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,470
requests anywhere else your browser

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,160
already happens files it'll just serve

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,690
them privately actually be used one

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,690
seeing that things acedia and can be

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:48,590
used for and I can't setting these rules

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:56,900
are pretty similar this we got this is

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:59,390
the the first part of it is the main

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:06,260
request of the site and that actually

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:13,520
goes to the server server but the rest

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:17,360
of these all the rest of the big big

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,120
images all that are serving from my

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,750
local browser which means it's super

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,490
fast

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,930
the waiting's works the first time you

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,180
go to the site these images although

00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,730
from the server and saved in your

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,260
browser now the next time you go to it

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,900
your brother already have all these

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,800
things there's nothing it's just loading

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:44,860
these from the data browser you set the

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:53,990
rules on this in either Apache or nginx

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:56,600
tutorials about how to do this if you

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,250
are using a CDN there's often an

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:20,660
interface for setting up those rules in

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:26,030
the CDN so this is the slide part of the

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:28,120
nation for this talk is that Google is

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:33,340
starting to pay attention to these

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:38,620
metrics more and especially this summer

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,620
I've seen a lot of clients of ours

00:27:45,910 --> 00:28:00,940
started you may have seen there's tools

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,039
google is also measuring your website

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:10,500
performance every time somebody

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,860
they're gathering telemetry data about

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:17,130
this so if you're not using this

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,110
practice in browser caching or a CDN or

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,750
even going to get a lot of traffic in

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,580
your site it's rational

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,380
google has telemetry data about that it

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,419
knows how fast it is it's not just

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,000
serving the site up for you a lot to be

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,429
fast it's serving it up reliably every

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,240
day to be fast and hold through the

00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:39,330
fastest sites with good content that are

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,679
stable and reliably online are getting

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:47,440
ranked high and duck any SEO consultant

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,609
it will say performance is important

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,609
[Music]

00:28:52,370 --> 00:29:00,450
these are some of the tools I use every

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,640
day to to achieve that goal Mercedes all

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:07,770
right so this is the bar but how to

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,450
actually implement some of these so the

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,429
easiest thing to do is to just use it

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,520
will manage the WordPress house stop

00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:16,919
time to do this on your own and sign up

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:22,080
for WPA or pressable

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:31,440
or even some lower cost managed

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:32,840
WordPress if you use a managed WordPress

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,770
plan

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:40,460
like cPanel or the absolute cheapest

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,779
share coast England all of the expensive

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,390
in it shows that they have at the top

00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:47,179
include full page caching and most of

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,100
the ones included on bottom is list this

00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:51,799
is the small place their site ground

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,360
there's it's a gigantic list of managed

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,500
WordPress notice it's out there so

00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,620
finally like Michael has pricing who

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,580
works for you and you can get building

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:08,230
fashion not all of them but most of them

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,750
do and it's great to build in because

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,279
the strategy for how it works how to set

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,770
it up you already kind of figured that

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,450
out you just have to be them the money

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,669
and goes through site there you will get

00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,330
the benefit of their full page cache you

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:26,419
can tell the systems that they set up

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:32,890
those leg guarantee on all those on the

00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:32,890
top options or ingredients to get all

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:40,429
they even do bulking action on the CDN

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:42,980
level so this really makes it easy

00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:44,360
they also most of these support object

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,710
national where there's just a button in

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,529
your dashboard turned up they're

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,940
catching on and off super easy so this

00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:55,039
takes care of almost all of your

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:59,440
problems if you are more doing it

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,480
yourself think of a solution server or

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,210
shared hosting there's a lot of

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,549
WordPress plugins that can also make

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,309
this easy for you full page caching is a

00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:12,580
pretty soft the problem the WP super

00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:15,970
cache plugin we're a people mostly start

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,519
is well supported automatic is important

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:21,879
at this point it's been around forever

00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:23,169
and it works on pretty much any site if

00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:25,179
you're using manage go steam you know

00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:30,490
get all this but if you're doing it

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:33,190
yourself this is a really easy for the

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,370
CDN CloudFlare and secure you both have

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,649
really nice air faces it's pretty easy

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,090
to get started with that once you kind

00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:43,929
of go through there set up and follow

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:52,450
the instruction you will have both

00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:53,980
firewall and forever that's I think the

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,259
easiest thing to do is it using bug

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,149
versus or security they have button

00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,649
suppressing their basics you just

00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,740
overwrite it and say I want things to

00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:06,429
catch them rather for two days or 30

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:09,629
days or whatever so that's pretty easy

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:12,970
too if you want to get more advanced

00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:16,330
these are the tools that I look at and I

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:18,879
use or a full page action we use the

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:22,480
back cache WordPress plug-in or we use

00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:24,340
Bharti - totally suffers software that

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,259
you would install the server but if the

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,429
absolute fastest most configurable

00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:31,899
caching setup we get robbed and caching

00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:34,480
there's a wordpress plugin that

00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:37,270
integrates brightest

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,590
installed on server CDN CloudFlare

00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,750
security

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,340
nearly work great for all all your needs

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,350
there's a ton of difference again

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,559
providers out there you can find one of

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:51,700
the matches and forever attaching the

00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,190
double waiting except the sub-base we

00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,160
would use in connector matching do you

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:59,140
define specific headers or when the

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,580
cycle of the telogen browser how long

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:12,760
and cache this this asset port there's

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:18,309
lots lots of tutorials all right so the

00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:20,620
key takeaways here the definition for

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:23,250
caching is storing information in an

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:28,480
easy to access location to be usually

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:33,910
the data we can store here is the

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:37,660
results of queries or we can store the

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:40,510
entire HTML page or home page caching or

00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,820
we can store our images and dump script

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,700
files any media assets that might be

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,840
served from your site that's the CDN or

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,840
our presentation

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,169
so we're going to be started somewhere

00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:59,440
start with full page caching that's in

00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:03,459
half of the absolute maximum impact mood

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,229
matching options interrupted speed and

00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,570
scalability and it's also one of the

00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:12,010
easiest to you install company just

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:15,220
started with the second one I think is

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:19,179
important if you have a problem with the

00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:22,210
caching it's not actually very likely

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:53,500
that is the caching plug-in installed or

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:55,299
problem most of the popular there are

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,299
things out there that trying to be with

00:34:55,299 --> 00:35:01,119
800 days and it's like I stalled it now

00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:03,880
there's plenty different setting screens

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,690
with 800 buttons and they don't know

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,460
what button to push if you're not sure

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,319
what to do get rid of that one and

00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,700
trying to unplug it there's simpler ones

00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:17,740
I am really like it WordPress to find a

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,809
plug-in that does the one thing I want

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:25,029
to do it does it efficiently without

00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:27,520
many options or settings so with WP

00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:29,829
super cache if too many options and the

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,069
working kind of all default there's a

00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:33,460
plugin called hyper captions even

00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:37,010
simpler than that

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,950
I think there's bug in 34 somewhere

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,510
or page caching so if you don't like it

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,010
and you're finding too confusing they

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,290
don't like the documentation of trying

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,580
different plugin there's a lot of them

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,850
there's a lot of them that are really

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,850
good and it's important to buy something

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:54,920
simple you're confident you know we're

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,809
doing just what they wanted to do and

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,630
this is my advice

00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:10,109
we try to find something that's focused

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:12,329
on doing what you want us all right so

00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:18,259
this is me beside slides are gonna be up

00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:18,259
there and thank you for waiting

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:28,140
[Applause]

00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:51,609
yes and thank you for asking that's an

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,700
excellent question the question was

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,200
about if you have things that are

00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,839
cashing in the browser and you're doing

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,759
developed be changing your CSS or new

00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,890
images or something like that how do you

00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:05,309
get these devices to clear that be stuck

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:08,670
with you old cash cronies like this too

00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,670
sometimes impossible

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:15,819
so when designs are attached to the

00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:18,700
browser or guest on the CDN the way that

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:23,619
they're uniquely identify as that

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:26,920
specific CSS or J s file is the URL so

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,380
the URL changes it's a different thing

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,450
now an easy way to do that is they're

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,789
not a complete URL but to change the

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,720
query parameters that are at the end of

00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:40,989
the URL because that's included in

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,499
identifying file as that file so if we

00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:47,579
were to append something every time you

00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:51,009
must be JavaScript like question mark

00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:54,579
version rules one question mark version

00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:57,400
equals one point two you can change that

00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:59,710
version number and when you change that

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,529
version number the browser will see this

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:05,680
as a new file could be like over and you

00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:09,099
know whatever version 1.3 you catch that

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,269
separately from the old one so there's a

00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:12,269
couple of plugins and

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,409
[Music]

00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:01,789
because they're trying to optimize on

00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:03,769
bandwidth and people may not have all

00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,599
the mobile data or connections you would

00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:08,059
have and help with broadband so I think

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,700
really aggressively - and I think the

00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:23,920
same trick with app version and your

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:23,920
assets dynamic past that versioning yep

00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,640
there's not really a good reason to use

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,950
one and the other I don't have to go

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,700
with Redis because Gambia is a really

00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:44,240
nice gratis plugin for WordPress and

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:49,510
it's updated exported and it works well

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,510
but memcache is really the same thing

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:57,860
no they're they're redundant if you

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,110
happen to be an environment where you

00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,670
have been patched all right whatever you

00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,240
know - it works great

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:08,230
there's not good caching plugins or - I

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,230
was starting out

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,950
yes some of that data is from the

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,390
crawler crawler see they deserve counsel

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,369
I think most of us have brought our

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:41,660
speakers if you have to Google PageSpeed

00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:44,300
inside this image and you run a test on

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,210
your site they'll get you boxes at the

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:50,119
top that it will say do kind of like a

00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:53,630
performance ranking score and that thing

00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,700
that is coming from Pro it's not from

00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,560
the Google crawler and if you don't have

00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,860
a safe bit that maybe people thought you

00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,600
have to go get Google reports for this

00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,490
to really say this may be a popular site

00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:13,630
it will show you in these two boxes the

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:18,250
performance score that data and then a

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:22,100
cloud account there's all kinds of

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:25,119
queries of it I think haven't actually

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,119
gotten there but I ready

00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:43,319
yeah people we know not everybody's out

00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:52,559
there is going to use best practices and

00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:55,349
start shoving large images I'm not

00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,660
worried about that in the browser

00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,730
I mean it's storing these images just as

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,260
files on your disk right right so the

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,170
image is just sitting on your disk

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,000
so you're loading it from the disk

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,000
rather than loading it over the network

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,660
is there a point I mean you know people

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,160
are just continually sending all these

00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,220
images and things like that because they

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,589
really care that website to look good at

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,300
some point someone's gonna start Katrina

00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:27,420
I mean yeah you run out of disk space

00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:29,670
eventually I think browser is you know

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,680
I'm not 100% sure how that works in

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,990
browsers I do think they intelligently

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,910
that managed that cache based on how

00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,559
often you go to that site if you're

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,200
running out of disk space stuff like

00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,510
that I haven't found any degradation on

00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,190
performance where I think you get into

00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,619
trouble with Brad degradation of

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,480
importance of browsers is when you're

00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,160
loading the kind of stuff with

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,530
JavaScript like you have all these jobs

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,510
for your pads or some of the JavaScript

00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,309
files themselves but now you're running

00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:59,069
all that code in the browser rather than

00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:01,020
on your server and in the browser not

00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:02,589
everyone is going to have a brand new

00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,869
MacBook Pro you know

00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:07,450
people with five-year-old laptop it's

00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:09,910
not super powerful and it might work

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:12,009
great on your system but never be able

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:30,999
to run that mask so that's more what I

00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:31,509
worry about about performance yes sort

00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:36,609
of

00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:38,079
I wouldn't it's important not to those

00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,539
important not that haven't done it

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,430
caching it's really difficult to manage

00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:44,410
and you get rules that are gonna work

00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,359
for each other

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,609
so if you have one object gnashing going

00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:50,109
on don't think those isn't doing

00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:51,819
everything now I need another object

00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:54,640
actually switched to another object

00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:57,009
captions we don't we - at the same time

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,489
don't use full gauge - eating at your

00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:02,979
hosting provider and then use both eh -

00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:04,719
at the CDN if you're going to use a CDN

00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:06,999
like fastly that you can do phobia

00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,190
caching on let's go to the trouble

00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:11,950
setting up on page caching better turn

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,229
off the Golden Age caching on the

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,210
hosting provider or at least think about

00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:18,079
it and make sure that they're not

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,539
stepping on each other

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,700
they're set up to tolerate each other

00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:25,529
rather than what you have to pretend

00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,039
it's here going after additional twenty

00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:32,309
minutes here now exactly 30 minutes now

00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,200
you can't tell where this going wrong so

00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:39,529
just be deliberate about your choices

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,529
more cashing in the doggies better

00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:44,730
buying the solution for each metal layer

00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,999
of that - if that thing sex it over all

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,999
times

00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:58,710
yeah I like starting right away with

00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,040
caching online and having a built

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:04,440
environment map cache enables is great

00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:07,380
because you see how it works the

00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,500
attachment system and that's where I

00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:15,140
think the local like local that flywheel

00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:18,300
[Music]

00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:22,410
having about the entire memory and play

00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,970
with - you know works really helps it

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:29,490
makes it easier because they know that a

00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:31,830
place where it's like works for the most

00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,260
part most likes to be very compatible

00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,990
with old age caching things that could

00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,730
screw this up or if you're doing

00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:41,880
database rights are collecting data on

00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:43,980
the front end of the site specifically I

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,730
students when their sites and apps of

00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:53,820
plug-in that is you know tracking poro

00:45:47,730 --> 00:46:06,150
cores or tracking user data I'm using

00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:09,090
ableton spot for for that for the most

00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:13,520
part for what most people

00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:17,090
you to publish a dense page - to work

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,090
very simple

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,230
[Music]

00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,140
I'm not sure that's a good question do

00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:42,500
you know what kind of caching plug-in

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:44,330
newsmaker need to work back so generally

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,850
the times we want to delete your cache

00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,070
is if you did something like I published

00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:52,990
an article in for some reason we can't

00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:55,030
see it when I visit my site possibly

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,500
there's a thing that is bought in

00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:03,740
caching and I cleared the cache role

00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:05,660
version go leg fresh I don't think that

00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,609
in most cases there's no reason you

00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,470
would ever need your cash all the

00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:14,090
program is just do its thing and work

00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:19,460
fine even a lovely if you get into a

00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:47,630
situation like that and there's some to

00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:50,420
try okay bring in custom plugins the

00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,450
best practice well duh be breaks to the

00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,820
database right do reads and share your

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,470
content don't log stuff unless you're

00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:02,150
doing a plug-in that's like WordPress

00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:05,300
comments or a forum or something if you

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:09,130
looking at the WordPress codex there's a

00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:12,050
lot of application about how to leverage

00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,880
up and caching and there's some simple

00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,480
calls in WordPress when you're doing

00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,450
this development that you can say okay

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:25,250
we're building this whatever widget for

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:28,160
most popular content right so when you

00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,410
do need these calls you figure out all

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,450
these things you can then catch the

00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,850
results and it's really easy because

00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:37,850
WordPress gives you a function say

00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:42,109
basically cache the results of all this

00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:45,950
stuff and cash it for this long and you

00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:47,510
can build that into the plug-in anywhere

00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:50,450
you have something like expensive going

00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,520
on you can build that in anybody don't

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,260
have a cache there's no passion going on

00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,390
about the site they don't cache enable

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,740
it doesn't matter but just won't do that

00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,600
they'll just keep doing the database

00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,609
query and you know it'll just ignore

00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,470
that they do have dashing

00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:07,289
it'll start using it

00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:11,019
there's good resources out there

00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:13,839
WordPress codex you say work work town

00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:15,730
antenna research 10 up engineering best

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,920
practices we talk a lot about you

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:26,799
our best practices which are open source

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:30,190
available for anyone to read so then if

00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:32,319
you have a site where every single page

00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,930
has a place of comment or like a

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:41,819
MailChimp's I'm not you

00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:41,819
hoping not not necessarily

00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:50,529
and your forums are set up in general

00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:53,950
the forms of submission if it's a forum

00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:55,749
putting your content click the button it

00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,539
submits a post request to the server

00:49:55,749 --> 00:50:02,799
with all that that data and you get a

00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:05,470
like thanks for some a kind of thing or

00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:08,430
some sort of feedback all the times

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,720
those are built either with JavaScript

00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,829
when it's the post request that's not

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,660
going to be cash

00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:18,009
most times stuff like that with comments

00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:24,069
or just a like a newsletter signup is

00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:26,559
actually cash catchable it depends on

00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:28,329
how it's built in pentatonix is done but

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,940
the WordPress building comments should

00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:33,930
be at all

00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:41,280
and be fine and most of the email

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:42,960
reports should be doesn't change this

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,970
period that every user days being

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,609
served.the or they're usually okay it's

00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,109
definitely something you would want to

00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:54,240
like if you have a captioning your

00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:59,790
abling it those are exactly the things

00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:05,430
that we test test those things and make

00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:06,930
sure somebody else I think all these

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:12,349
people pointing out there is this means

00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:12,349
time is up right now all right thank you

00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,560
