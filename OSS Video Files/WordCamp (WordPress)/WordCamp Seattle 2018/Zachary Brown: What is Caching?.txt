Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Caching is critical to the functioning of the modern web. From CDNs to browser caching to DNS TTLs to the WordPress object and full page cache, caching can be a confusing and challenging topic. With Google emphasizing site performance in the latest page rank algorithm changes, it is a topic we canâ€™t afford to ignore. This talk will explain caching in layman terms (with some power-user pro-tips sprinkled throughout) and will give actionable advice on how to make caching work for any site. We will cover the tools available and how to use them effectively and where it might be worth spending money to get better results.
