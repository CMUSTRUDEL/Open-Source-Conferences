Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	The term “incremental website design” was first introduced to capture the reality of constant new content creation and adjustments inherent in the inbound marketing methodology. Gone are the days of building the website and leaving it alone for months on end. This workshop will focus on packaging and selling monthly retainers for incremental website design and maintenance specifically for small business owners. We will discuss contracts, monthly strategy meetings, goal setting, and the array of service options, and pricing. Best suited for the solo or small shop designers.
Suggested questions:
How do you manage expectations and control scope creep each month?
What are the downside risks of incremental design?
When is it best not to suggest incremental design?
