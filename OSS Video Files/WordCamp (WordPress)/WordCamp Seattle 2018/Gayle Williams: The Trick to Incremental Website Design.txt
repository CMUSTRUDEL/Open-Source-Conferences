Title: Gayle Williams: The Trick to Incremental Website Design
Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	The term “incremental website design” was first introduced to capture the reality of constant new content creation and adjustments inherent in the inbound marketing methodology. Gone are the days of building the website and leaving it alone for months on end. This workshop will focus on packaging and selling monthly retainers for incremental website design and maintenance specifically for small business owners. We will discuss contracts, monthly strategy meetings, goal setting, and the array of service options, and pricing. Best suited for the solo or small shop designers.
Suggested questions:
How do you manage expectations and control scope creep each month?
What are the downside risks of incremental design?
When is it best not to suggest incremental design?

thank you thanks for having me work work

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:37,699
camp Seattle I am here from Sarasota

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,780
Florida the exact opposite and I think

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:42,230
you you might see yesterday a friend of

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,210
mine

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,780
Liz Corson speaking long right right

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,809
right now and so we both came from the

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,230
ends of the earth to Seattle to do with

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:58,180
you and it's exciting so how many of you

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,620
in the audience are agency owners

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:07,460
freelancers you're building websites are

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:10,100
other people oh yeah yeah and how many

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,899
of you know that you're already using

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:19,069
some form of incremental website design

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:20,929
okay what I'm gonna do today firstly are

00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:23,209
you introduced myself as being from

00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:26,810
Sarasota should a few other things to

00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:31,880
need to know about me is that I am NOT a

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:34,759
developer I am not really a computer

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,959
person that's all how I've always felt

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:42,979
although I did have an early tandy and

00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:46,160
was the one who set up those first IBM

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:50,119
pcs the very first generation for my

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,280
first job but I've never really

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,239
identified as a computer person I'm

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,569
really more of a writer a communicator a

00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,240
marketing person a PR person and so I

00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:06,310
write about music because

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:11,380
flutist and I'm from Orlando Florida but

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:15,160
I'm here today to talk about how we can

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,739
approach website design in a way that

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,930
they might be different truly from what

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,500
you're already doing but how would you

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,930
frame it for our clients and maybe frame

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,950
it for ourselves so that it can be to

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,069
our advantage and for our clients we're

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,250
going to talk about website redesign

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:39,459
kind of look back on what they did and

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,519
what the reality is today I wouldn't

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:48,130
look at the various types of incremental

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:51,040
website design we can talk about and how

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:58,420
we can really use it okay so everyone on

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,860
board to that website redesign now of

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,290
course in the very early days we were

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,330
building a new website for a company

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,120
that was asking this do you think this

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,510
internet thing is going to stick around

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,560
thank you

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:15,340
do we need a website anyone developing

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,769
websites back in the 1990's do you

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,989
remember how expensive they were how

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,910
much did we charge for them it was 40 50

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:30,970
thousand right off for a 10 page website

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:34,360
in my far off it was pretty Kravis one

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:38,170
buying buying them or it was pretty

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,290
crazy and then because it was such a big

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,000
deal to get your first website I would

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:51,430
say for 10-15 years after that whenever

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,380
company needed to redo their website it

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,680
was a big deal you would have whole

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,880
committee you would have everyone

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,120
getting together and talking about all

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,930
the departmental

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,849
aspects and then you wouldn't have the

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,310
quoting system and it was crazy but what

00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,019
would happen is you'd actually just tear

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,880
down the old site just tear it down and

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:20,419
rebuild it because comb was different it

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,060
was a very different thing and so

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:27,169
building in the website was this

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,840
monumental task and I was inside those

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,940
companies where it's like okay it's

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,590
going to take us two years but we're

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:40,490
going to build a new website and it was

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,280
painful and this is kind of what it

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,020
looked like you see you would build your

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,000
website it would be the best thing in

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,660
the world and you wouldn't touch it for

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,550
five years

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,830
and it would slowly decay and lose its

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,889
productivity and then you would build a

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:03,410
website and let it decay again for five

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:07,130
years did y'all see that - and the

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,139
painful everytime so didn't have to be

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,889
that way but this was what we

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:17,539
experienced and I mention the cash

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:19,430
crunch - now I remember that when I'm a

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,950
contract for someone and then when I

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,099
first started off how we would bill for

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,610
new website design we would ask for

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:31,280
fifty percent down payment that's pretty

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,039
much the norm these days isn't it still

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,860
in my office okay

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:40,310
50% down payment double start and then

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,830
the balance is due before launch or you

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:49,130
might have stages but if you have a team

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,660
your client is taking and has the

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,690
mindset that it's going to take months

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:58,820
it's gonna take a year to figure this

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,950
out you end up holding back you are kind

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,690
of working to not get

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:08,200
cash into your business for a long time

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:10,330
so I see that as a real problem luckily

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:16,420
these days we can build websites a lot

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:18,270
faster at least our side of it but we

00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,750
have to do something totally different

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:24,990
we cannot be in that crunch mindset

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,840
anymore

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:33,010
anyone familiar with Kaiser it's the

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,290
lean production daily constant continual

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,600
improvement and this was something that

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:42,670
came from Japanese manufacturing

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,470
processes and it has colored almost

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,890
every bit of our world because we're all

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,300
beginning to see wait is it kind of

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,680
weight loss can be this way I'm just

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,360
going to do a little bit every day a

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,600
little bit doesn't do better every day I

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,540
began talking within these terms to my

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,970
clients the number of years ago just

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,480
let's let's do something let's get

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,000
something going and when I was working

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,850
now that I'm working in WordPress it's

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,960
really easy to just keep going you don't

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,250
have to swipe them or clean you just

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,640
keep everything up to date and you

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,390
switch some things out but that's

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,160
continuous change for good then and I

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,010
know there must be some developer

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,510
software development companies they use

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:38,170
really that reiterative design and it's

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:42,960
a pretty logical structure initial

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,460
planning you detail the requirements you

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,480
analyze what needs to happen and you

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,000
implement and then deployment that would

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,820
be the launch we get the specs for the

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,680
website you collect all the content or

00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,680
we develop the content we build a

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,220
structure we put it all together and

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,840
then launch but then we also test it to

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,790
see how it's going we evaluate do we do

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,340
some ad tests

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:21,770
watch our analytics and go back into

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:23,750
planning a new stage of improvement but

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,660
that's still not what's happening for

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,140
most people I mean I care a smaller

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:35,030
smaller agencies that build a website

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:37,580
and then they follow up with a client

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:41,510
and they may get a maintenance contract

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:44,300
or may not and then maybe touch base

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:49,540
with them a year later or if you follow

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:52,310
what Jocelyn huh no problem but joseline

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,720
joseline and Rhonda were saying you keep

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,740
in touch with your clients

00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:04,790
but if why not be working on their

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:06,650
website much more frequently and of

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,920
course Eric Reese would believe startup

00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:14,950
this this idea of continually working is

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,950
just part of our this zeitgeist today

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:22,220
and when I joined up with HubSpot any

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:28,460
other have spotters in the audience no

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:32,510
oh okay are you still a partner it's

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,390
expensive however I learned so much just

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:38,690
running with that crowd and one of the

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,760
things that we got in our coaching was

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,860
remember we were being coached through

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,070
this process of working with clients

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,480
building on HubSpot fully full inbound

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,480
