Title: Imei Hsu: It’s Not About You, It’s About Them
Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Having just finished the Herculean project of having someone design an entire website off of an idea I had been sitting on for three years, I learned an important lesson. The finished website is not about you, and it’s not exactly just about the product, service, or resource you’re selling.
It’s really about the audience you are trying to connect with. It’s all about them.
Learn from Imei’s three-year journey into collecting the information, the aesthetic, and hiring the design company that would pull together her message to targets a specific audience, and why she insisted on having the entire website placed on WordPress so that she could better respond to the changing needs of her target audience.
