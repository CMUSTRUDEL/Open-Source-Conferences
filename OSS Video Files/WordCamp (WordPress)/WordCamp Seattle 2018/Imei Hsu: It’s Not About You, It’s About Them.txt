Title: Imei Hsu: It’s Not About You, It’s About Them
Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Having just finished the Herculean project of having someone design an entire website off of an idea I had been sitting on for three years, I learned an important lesson. The finished website is not about you, and it’s not exactly just about the product, service, or resource you’re selling.
It’s really about the audience you are trying to connect with. It’s all about them.
Learn from Imei’s three-year journey into collecting the information, the aesthetic, and hiring the design company that would pull together her message to targets a specific audience, and why she insisted on having the entire website placed on WordPress so that she could better respond to the changing needs of her target audience.

to myself I need to stop until the side

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:46,850
she says parking spots if you just keep

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:50,159
driving back this part comes towards me

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,960
and because the streets very narrow it's

00:01:50,159 --> 00:02:00,560
one direction one car at a time

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:04,950
[Music]

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,060
this car comes back I go back to where I

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,560
was I say the lady

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,560
excuse me lady what she said

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:43,680
my spot and then sure enough lady I've

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,570
got to and she starts on her a little

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,600
tirade again I just interrupted her I

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,530
said lady you need to listen to

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,930
I have to say to you your pantyhose and

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:04,080
your shirt is sticking out her

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:10,200
petticoats and her Fanny was up there

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,150
exposed her world you just saved me up

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:21,540
about to go downtown both of her

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:28,110
presentation you don't think that's what

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:30,660
she wanted so what I do is about this

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,840
discovery process and what I want to

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,030
share with you that you need to hear or

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,890
you know somebody who needs to hear this

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,380
whether you are business owner yourself

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,200
or your designer working with clients

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,370
trying to help other people understand

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,070
the process of trying to create

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:56,130
something big of your website blog

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:58,740
content it's about them it's about who

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:06,380
out there is going to be seeing this end

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:11,280
product technology issues catch us up

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,790
you need to keep this image in mind my

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,710
experience with helping clients and a

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,380
psychotherapist was mentioned before I

00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:23,850
have sincere conflict and often this

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,810
thing under the things that appliances

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:31,050
see it's not the disputes and

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,320
head-butting six of them circuits it's

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,110
the thing under the thing when you're

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,720
communicating with clients you want to

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:54,120
keep drilling down beneath the surface

00:04:39,720 --> 00:05:00,240
to understand what's truly something for

00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:09,570
designers and as a I had this fantastic

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:12,000
idea 2015 I was already way of having

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,970
been diagnosed with celiac disease her

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,240
medical history Titus which were both

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,030
all the new diseases and over 300 food

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,220
allergies and intolerances I was one

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:30,320
very sick person and a driving blog but

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,739
better by 2015 I got diagnosed in 2013

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,549
by 2015 I have

00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:40,799
creating a website and blog that had

00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:42,989
services and products for people like

00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:46,349
myself because I knew they were over

00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:49,769
over 22 billion people with immune

00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:52,289
disease and another 50 to 75 million

00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:56,159
just in the US alone who have at least

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:58,289
one serious food allergy millions more

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:00,479
within tolerances and then we had this

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,939
other section of people with chronic

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,969
illnesses who had to make some kind of

00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,219
lifestyle shift and what I was hearing

00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:10,309
the feedback from other doctors nurses

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,229
and mental health professionals is that

00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:15,199
these people who learn what is this

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,759
thing to do but they had a hard time

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,629
implementing it and why I'm here for

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,409
website service was to create a way for

00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:27,059
them to learn the lifestyle piece

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:30,059
something that wasn't fully being well

00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:32,610
represented out in terms of websites

00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:37,709
lots of medical information just not

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:40,229
having implemented so I found self a

00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,790
fantastic designer and we got to work I

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:47,600
hired Natalie McGuire

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,190
joins in organ her high star chips

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,390
banging about what it is that I

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,910
envisioned and she sent me this

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,340
fantastic workbook it was amazing

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,740
there are all these different fancy

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,530
words in it I'm not in the industry so I

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,890
was just like mooing and oh wow this is

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,310
great

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:09,320
we've been making easy for me to talk

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,930
about what it is I want to do and to get

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,850
this beautiful end product and now this

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,940
is really into the idea that every

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,019
website should be both functional and

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,019
[Music]

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:31,790
then it was kind of we started butting

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,130
heads not in a really negative way but

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,590
in a way where I would try to say one

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,210
thing she would say another and we were

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,190
almost saying the same thing that's

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,440
awesome missing each other at the same

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:49,310
time how their behavior lost I was like

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:51,320
born and she wanted to make certain that

00:07:49,310 --> 00:08:01,400
I understand certain concepts was

00:07:51,320 --> 00:08:03,860
supposedly they were all laid out over

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,520
again she was saying hey no need to work

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,620
on this section of your content so

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,170
here's a bunch of questions and the

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,999
questions were straightforward but then

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,309
what she mapped it to

00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:21,199
so the labels what she called things I

00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:22,819
have no clue what they actually meant if

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,829
you're on the inside of the industry

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,099
then you know what you're looking for if

00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:34,189
you say right being about me page you

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:36,800
know what you're talking about the

00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:38,899
client thinks here's what about the

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,849
pages about oh it's about everything

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:47,870
that I've done since kindergarten and

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:52,279
it's about me page is far more than that

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:57,500
it's about only 20% about me as a client

00:08:52,279 --> 00:09:00,410
and 80% about them the audience out

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,509
there who's not many yet it doesn't know

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:12,069
about your products and services or your

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:14,949
idea or and so if it's the client survey

00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:18,850
the client doesn't get it

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,850
it looks like this

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:28,779
you mean you don't have we need you and

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,779
me me me me me me me it's the lady with

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,250
she can still do her job she could still

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,170
presented but she might be embarrassed

00:09:37,250 --> 00:10:31,970
later the onions out there's having a

00:09:42,170 --> 00:10:34,880
hard time understanding they are asking

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,950
her to explain what she meant by

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,000
something she thought was really

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,880
perfectly clear in her her workbook and

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,450
in some ways it was I'm not faulting her

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,790
actually in her workbook what was great

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,580
it's just that her person who's not

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,110
industry what she thought she was asking

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,470
for it was not what she was getting from

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,970
me and that's why we were butting heads

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,630
so we need some shared language that's

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,760
the capital we are canvas and starboard

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,570
Eva's figure out what are we trying to

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,390
stay so the first steps to building to

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,480
bridging the gap that are created a gap

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:18,110
between both the designer and play and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,090
type and future audience is to develop

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:28,220
shared language and the way to do this

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:36,350
is you listen was a plant trying to stay

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:40,120
and then you do that by defining and

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:43,400
then asking for the thing that you want

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,550
then telling them what it's called you

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,670
don't put out the word post necessarily

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:54,590
the label and expect them to know what

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:59,750
you're asking for describe then put the

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:03,770
label to it that's called this I learned

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:08,870
from my friend and most memorable rising

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:12,560
speech because speech coach dr. Michelle

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,410
Mazur which is here in Seattle I learned

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,930
that something like my about me page

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,440
wasn't really about me like I mentioned

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:25,220
it's more about what the audience out

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:34,670
there is going to eventually see about

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:36,589
why they see me actually I kept wanting

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,939
to just talk about what I've done

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,759
why people would want to work with

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:44,089
people because of my credentials or my

00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,949
background and what I was missing

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,649
is the about me and was actually

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:52,189
supposed to extract through the way of

00:12:48,649 --> 00:13:09,250
that outer audience out there being able

00:12:52,189 --> 00:13:09,250
to see themselves you go up an industry

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:20,509
attorneys go on attorneys website and go

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:32,800
to the about me page tell me if you are

00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:36,620
snoring paragraph because there is an

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,950
attorney it's full of a lot of detail

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:43,560
about where they went to school and

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,350
have taken and what kinds of experiences

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,800
they have and maybe some preferences are

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,080
people gave them great reviews but it is

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,279
not really glittering about being page

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,020
is about or supposed to be about and so

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,630
most people don't get the information

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,370
they actually means to make the decision

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:06,540
of whether they want to work with you

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:09,240
and that's what Maddie was having a hard

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,839
time translating to me or helping me

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,839
understand

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:39,020
[Music]

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:02,360
now can you see why we kept going I'm

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:17,510
not kidding she needed to help me

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:21,200
understand what it was everything even

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,680
just that process of it I needed to have

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,440
her explain to me what the purpose of

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,560
the Logan was to define what it is and

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,620
what his true function was because I

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,580
just kept picking things based on stuff

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:41,080
that I white which is fine when you

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:45,610
start with I wasn't thinking about how

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,720
they're going to connect with my logo

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,339
maybe that's just me and when we're

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,589
gonna look around so I start looking

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,890
around other people's websites and

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,110
examples of logos and I can see the same

00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,540
thing I can see what was I totally could

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,990
not connect with because it was around

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,610
somebody else's vision for themselves

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,610
but they forgot that extra piece

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:18,369
sell for somebody else did we tell them

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:20,889
how to bridge back down so secondly

00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:24,149
after you've gotten the client to stop

00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:27,910
and then listen you ask them questions

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,639
you can keep reminding that client to

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,610
ask this question as they give you the

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,499
content and the emotional mood or

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,569
experience it needs to be improving in

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:40,600
their 30 just like you keep asking them

00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,939
how will this translate to your client

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,499
out there their future client is future

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:53,019
audience my ayats for my ology advocate

00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:56,019
for people who are sick and tired number

00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:59,069
one complaint when they come to me is

00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,069
that they are tired

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:07,600
some of them were losing hope when you

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:11,140
weren't reading all your energy you

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,600
can't even read a website the fact that

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,390
are standing here today after being

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,270
hospitalized over and over again of

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,919
going from having a double masters we've

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,779
been able to memorize top seconds

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,929
because my cognitive processes were

00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,990
interrupted for about two years and so

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm building it back since then now I

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,830
understand

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,320
is feeling so everything into this

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,110
design started reflecting back she can

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,920
give me a stamp when I grow that font is

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:48,190
too hard for a child person to read make

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:52,180
it darker make it bigger it easier to me

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,580
if its shape so I didn't always have the

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,410
label like I can't exactly say I want

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,320
this kind of thought because that's I'm

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,890
not in the industry but I know it when I

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,770
saw it and so then we could dialogue

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:10,900
that way wants me to be darker easier to

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:13,200
read not tiny images needed to pop the

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,860
content needed to address illness

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,620
dead-on and not be sanitized what I mean

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:26,760
by sanitize it we have nice light ways

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,760
of saying I had a challenge

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:36,980
[Music]

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:54,070
people out of Canada do like that I

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,950
guess all searches colitis celiac

00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:00,460
disease feed one of them and whole host

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,220
of other conditions the time they spend

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,090
in the bathroom is can be quite painful

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:10,450
and a very very intense and so we made

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:18,280
certain that that concept would not be

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:24,460
sanitized so the first things you see

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:26,380
are not about me it's about that so this

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,840
is one of the first movies you'll see

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,000
when you pull up the final design that

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:37,420
we came up with fill your body it

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:42,210
doesn't have to be so good if you go to

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,210
other websites a similar context about

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:49,650
disease you don't see that we'll see

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:53,220
more of the about any stuff more

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:56,740
commonplace is what I was thinking

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,500
and instead we decided to go in the

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,450
opposite direction how can they outer

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:08,770
audience out there already seeing

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:12,700
themselves here the funny thing is that

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,890
when now that came up with this idea of

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,660
state like really working with me to try

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,940
and put something like this up front

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:24,730
she said you have to show me how you

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,700
want to sell it to the people out there

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:33,670
and my first response was well my lot in

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,080
sales and so this third challenge that

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,510
you want to help your place where it is

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,119
to bridge this other gap where they tell

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,219
you

00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,919
street they really don't understand how

00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:45,619
to sell their product or service they're

00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,979
gonna get hung up and stalled because of

00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,629
this word sales and sales copy they

00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:55,699
don't understand what it is that you're

00:20:50,629 --> 00:21:00,349
asking information for and in my case

00:20:55,699 --> 00:21:02,779
when she asks me for sales copy I kind

00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:06,199
of the new thing but I made her a bunch

00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:08,359
of stuff that sounds like about me mr.

00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:10,639
price right and I'm not in the industry

00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,889
I didn't know what she was asking for

00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:15,829
so I engage my more about meaningful

00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:18,369
content and she came back and said

00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:19,519
that's more about the content sale

00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:32,509
content

00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:34,939
I need sales copy so so some of the ways

00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:37,699
that you can identify if your clients

00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:41,959
are getting hung up and this slide is

00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:44,659
that they stall they give you more about

00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:49,609
these stuff the coffee looks SuperDuper

00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:52,549
busy it's hard to understand like not

00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:55,149
something audiences point of view and

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,149
also

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:12,390
and at this point one of the best things

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,120
I thought I was stuck with it

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,970
yes purple I'm trying to come up the

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,800
stairs company not understanding what it

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,960
is that she was looking for we kind of

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,860
just bashed around the back for another

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,810
three months that's not what I do but

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,830
it's not really what she did so she said

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,220
it's okay

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,269
that's why a new person

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,269
[Music]

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,950
and again to put the label on say we're

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,140
gonna write sales copy now to just ask

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,320
the right questions I gave her the

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,760
content and she showed me how it lines

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:06,550
up into five different areas to put into

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,190
my into a page and then I step out over

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:15,010
to now and it's miss what you want

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:16,480
and she's been robbing okay so now we're

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,550
back on track

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
so one of the option is you could refer

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,620
someone who writes that sales copy to do

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,750
that piece of it and then use that

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,740
shared language for communicating it

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,680
don't is an industry words you also have

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,470
the option to build off of anything that

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:50,620
your plank does know or examples of it

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:53,970
has said that they liked one of the

00:23:50,620 --> 00:24:01,810
other things I thought about all those

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:04,720
from the audience's in the fish sales

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:08,340
coffee does that audience member then

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,660
now have one to get a consultation or

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,840
purchase a product or why they're

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,330
purchasing of what benefits that we get

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,540
out of it and what did you do with that

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,540
knowledge

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,780
the future of many of you that's very

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,340
very intuitive for me after looking at

00:24:25,780 --> 00:25:11,140
all these different websites that never

00:24:27,340 --> 00:25:13,870
answered those questions it was with

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,679
what my friend dr. Michelle is appalled

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:19,860
her three word of the building a way for

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:24,010
me to remember what I'm all about

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,679
I'd like to create this in this website

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,929
in the first place and my mission became

00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:34,530
this three word rebellion they keep you

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:37,840
through fun again section forwards and

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,550
we made all the pictures and all the

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,770
colors about fun

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,830
there's the lines there's the oranges

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:49,530
there's the flavors

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:51,820
we're on it customized two universes

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:56,770
prescribed to people what we're going to

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:59,890
eat the lines around the eyes the

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:07,720
impaired Sicilian we had tons of fun of

00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:11,560
doing these photography and I want to

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,600
summarize what I said before to say we

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,930
want to strive to understand this thing

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,020
under the thing by asking questions

00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:22,450
stopping listening developing the shared

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,810
language if you want to mind the gaps in

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,420
what climber stands about translating is

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,670
that that idea to the audience that's

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,980
out there we need to hear about their

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,410
products and services then you want to

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:40,410
help your planet avoid the pitfalls of

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:43,210
the useless about being page or you know

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:47,110
another way of just saying that is give

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:49,660
them past them you can eat okay you need

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:53,200
to make the stage by helping to discover

00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,630
what the about me page is about I'll say

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,780
one last thing about that I think that

00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:02,670
it's actually pretty healthy for plants

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:06,270
to come to you with natural narcissism

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,270
narcissism is bad

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,200
they sold it to themselves

00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:39,220
their natural narcissism right so it

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,429
doesn't just end up being this is what I

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,320
didn't pass in me it becomes this is

00:27:42,429 --> 00:28:06,340
what I'm passionate about to share with

00:27:44,320 --> 00:28:08,740
you and I do want to say the ideas that

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:15,100
they want to turn into website but they

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:17,080
have no idea how to run website I come

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,970
with the mental health community there

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,760
are lots and lots of people and private

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,130
practice there is a website is create

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,370
aesthetics one huge thing that space is

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:30,299
same for the next 12 years and if you go

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,299
out there and look at it

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,559
[Music]

00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,860
when I was just like no design

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:03,020
background no check background she would

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,970
teach them hand them off on WordPress

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,039
and get them going so they could roll

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,110
underneath the hood and do all the kinds

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,270
of things that I love to be able to do

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:17,149
one is control how many of us have some

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,490
control issues you want to be able to

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:22,039
get into your psyche tiredness there's

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,750
something changes and be able to do that

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:29,029
overnight or within an hour because I

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,789
have seen this happen before if

00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:33,830
something changes and then I've got

00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:38,630
friends going I can't change this on my

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:41,480
website I don't know how so many times

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:44,090
there's things might just change really

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,090
quickly how many of you have heard this

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,270
beer is a vaccine is being developed for

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,250
Scooby I disease have you seen it okay

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,779
we're gonna have some about if you don't

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,500
know anything about the excuse would

00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:58,100
never hurt it it's kind of a big deal

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,110
another way

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,150
not a big deal but in terms of the

00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:29,140
research community this is a big deal

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:29,140
and this was very intuitive

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:37,419
but if it were I wanted to have the

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,309
power to go in there and change it and

00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:42,309
not have to wait on somebody else to do

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,309
it because I can tell you I just know

00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,200
too many people who have old material on

00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:48,700
their sites that they don't have a clue

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,350
that kind of change it's really

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,320
unfortunate because we've had such

00:30:50,350 --> 00:31:01,029
powerful tools so I like the control I

00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:03,940
like it ease of use fantastic job easy

00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:06,309
to use and it's not easy then they have

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,279
tutorials in about tutorial they've

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:12,729
helped us and helped us who can write

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:17,289
and ask any questions you want and get

00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:31,659
an answer or the people answering the

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:33,970
question I like the response and how

00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:38,619
quickly I can see people react to the

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:51,479
changes that I make I've been using

00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:57,070
since 2009 I can see in the Alliance of

00:31:51,479 --> 00:32:02,049
this desire that they two are the same

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:04,659
things home page versus we inquired as I

00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:07,059
am and I'll stay powered by WordPress or

00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:11,259
some other indication that it was been

00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:14,649
transferred onto WordPress and I know as

00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:17,009
I watched different sites make a little

00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:17,009
update

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,220
[Music]

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:27,620
because to get into a challenge and then

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,620
also

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,000
[Music]

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,600
so I just went to this session on

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,520
monetizing the webpage and the one who

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,730
spoke before do you do that with your

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,970
webpage or is that your attempt or is

00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:01,240
that or is it more of an information

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:04,450
source it started out as an information

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:08,950
resource but we started small with just

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:11,679
a couple of services so people who are

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:15,490
just newly diagnosed with a food allergy

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:19,000
or two or three or more or a serious

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:21,460
item you issue or both and they really

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,659
have no clue where the start I have

00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:28,419
everything from basic batch cooking 101

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:31,060
to virtual grocery shopping trip where I

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,010
go with them with their phone into the

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,570
grocery store and is sharing the backs

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,090
of labels and things and thinking about

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,370
flying and teach them how to read labels

00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,100
and she somehow to shop and put things

00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:45,220
together or just think about how to cook

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,740
two times a week for all seven days of

00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,560
the week things like that's best service

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:54,040
and we've built that into my website so

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,850
I thought about some services but

00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,120
selling them has a pride

00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,880
is a lot or they need like 30 days in

00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,210
free coaching so say they have a small

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,450
community people and they want to learn

00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:13,380
they can come in as a group and I would

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:14,730
teach them virtually through a different

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,520
internet-based

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,800
programs and they can watch

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,570
demonstrations pretty much any being

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,910
wanted there about the lifestyle pieces

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:28,140
whether it was adding a meditation for

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:31,050
stress reduction how to get active how

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,330
to cover again or how to clean out their

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:37,440
entire house for every kind of personal

00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:39,870
hygiene and firemen are total issues or

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:46,980
food issue because people are so

00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:55,620
sensitive how do you do that the

00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:57,810
resident on your apples contain so that

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,460
was a new one to be actually do some

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,590
we've got a tiny bit of food and

00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:11,010
exposure but you can ask them that I had

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:15,080
thoroughly double scrub so we talked

00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,080
about this in group setting

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:37,980
I did because there was a group out

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,260
there who contacted me being Paul the

00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:46,779
Center for chronic illness and there

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,779

00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:23,890
counseling background and notes my

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,130
parameter on my coaching side the less

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:33,690
medical side of the picture and major

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:36,130
choose so this side is all coaching and

we're going to have depression anxiety

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:37,360
that's what I will they ask me questions

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:56,230
about well they want some coaching on

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:59,560
that short great question I started a

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,990
facebook life and business finish and

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,810
then start taking my questions from the

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,650
audience themselves so as they bring up

00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,510
issues

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,100
I started close through they would ask

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,970
for questions and I think and I take

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,860
this question

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,870
and actually build content around it

00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,840
because it was a great question

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:19,320
so I remind my audience to tell me what

00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,320
I should write about

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,380

00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:50,600
it's just waiting shoes it's not tied to

00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,820
another disease state such as type 1

00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,460
diabetes which is an autoimmune disease

00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:59,420
that's the Ottoman version of diabetes

00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,090
right then yes it is just reach and

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,040
eating not as many people are going to

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,840
be attracted to my website because they

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,200
don't see themselves in those first

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:13,250

school teachers the chef and the school

00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:17,170
