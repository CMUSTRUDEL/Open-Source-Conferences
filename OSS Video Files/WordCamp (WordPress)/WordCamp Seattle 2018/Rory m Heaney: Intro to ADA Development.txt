Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Best way to be ADA compliant, or to show a level of compliance? Do it from the start. If you’re trying to be compliant after the fact, you could be in for a world of hurt.
In this discussion, we’ll go through a framework, active development, and how many things you could easily be doing during workflow from the start to make your website more accessible!
This doesn’t have to be hard! We are an open-source community, so let’s get everyone up to speed on how we can make our sites even more accessible.
