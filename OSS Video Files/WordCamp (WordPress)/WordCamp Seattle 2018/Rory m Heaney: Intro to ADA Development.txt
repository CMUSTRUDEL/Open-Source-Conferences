Title: Rory m Heaney: Intro to ADA Development
Publication date: 2020-04-07
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Best way to be ADA compliant, or to show a level of compliance? Do it from the start. If you’re trying to be compliant after the fact, you could be in for a world of hurt.
In this discussion, we’ll go through a framework, active development, and how many things you could easily be doing during workflow from the start to make your website more accessible!
This doesn’t have to be hard! We are an open-source community, so let’s get everyone up to speed on how we can make our sites even more accessible.

	00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:14,030
here I thought the best site you've ever

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:17,080
seen let's feel a little bit also just a

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:20,600
little page so I went through it was tap

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:25,360
enter escape

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,360
takes back to Center normal comply

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,200
anyone tell them what's wrong with the

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:40,970
floor already my flying for the forum

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:46,129
compliant completely low contrast and

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:48,860
there's no label go through here you go

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:53,809
focus on that focus on these great

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,760
fantastic buttons spacebar it means in

00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,960
any slighter on the planet also I want

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
me doing this I will slide or anything

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,430
else or the framework slider it's

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,170
already in it

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,820
that means said you ever gonna was

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,670
talking people like why is there a span

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,979
tag inside the button in the slider but

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,950
the commies hidden that's because it's

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:15,260
been planning to use the screen reader

00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,570
you pull up that button to have a label

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,640
or text inside of it so a screen will

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,400
have a good home next slide

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,900
current slide should be that's why that

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
text updates in those sliders

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,329
you see people delete that like oh well

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,140
just a button no no no it's in the text

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,390
is in for a reason so who's going

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,570
through buttons don't big deal so we

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,939
just have a long close is super super

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,950
basic example you notice I've skipped an

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,689
entire section because no links so

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,189
natural users well is just it just

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:52,609
content you're not going to tap through

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:56,899
that terrible speed let's go back use

00:01:52,609 --> 00:02:00,380
some of these super tools oh it's miss

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,750
default chrome let's go over awesome

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,399
tool it's called my house get it through

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,090
your browser as far as something much

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
similar

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,039
I believe it's maybe the same thing

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,170
anyone use about probably let's assume

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,040
all right and exercising notice it's not

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,350
the only thing here

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,790
let's practice performance SEO by the

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,280
way that's do is practice all plays into

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,080
accessibility let's just run it live or

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,490
anything on it on the page you should be

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,940
using this tool for all of your websites

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,310
it's going to give you freebies

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,580
Wayne's instant gratification for

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:37,710
watching messed up seven - that sucks

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:42,180
you should be 9200 so what's wrong

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:45,190
all of these images no alt tags

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,520
now the decorational and they don't need

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:53,380
descriptions they just need the tag they

00:02:48,520 --> 00:03:02,530
just need to tell form elements that

00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:05,560
form at the top no label color contrast

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,740
so we're gonna fight your desires to the

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,740
death

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,750
right color contrast is huge and in the

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,220
tool there's baked in references that we

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,520
flip out here just real quick both color

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,540
testers learn is it's complying a size

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,700
yes

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,870
font size S compliance based understand

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:38,440
we're trying to reach it can be rough

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:39,910
let's go back to the right here so some

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,270
slides will come with other elements

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,250
baked into them that's raw the buns we

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,380
softened left and right or incorrectly

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,260
should not be in the slider it should be

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,240
outside of the order of the list put

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,650
them somewhere else don't base stuff

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,900
into an order list with their slides or

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,150
anything else you can do that inside of

00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,230
this time content is all that stuff

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,010
because it's following an order of

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,380
operation good to go and of course

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,270
there's some additional sanity checks

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,220
everything we've done correctly and by

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:13,660
the way this page was just this out of

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,750
the box no extra work just order of

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,410
operations and buttons correctly

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,510
spending down whatever you use

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,169
immediately or in anything you do

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,840
already

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:26,610
so that's know you're all

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:34,550
compliant a lot it's not hard it doesn't

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:34,550
have to be scared that being said into

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,479
questions let's do it so we come to

00:04:40,110 --> 00:05:14,070
monkeys you have to flip the switch to

00:04:45,479 --> 00:05:15,600
turn it on that flip the switch right

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,979
with this attack if you want to use if

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,949
you want to use Chrome for your website

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,900
any page load it up use the plug-in

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:40,500
lighthouse and you just run that exact

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:43,530
thing I did right there there are like

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,229
there's yes select the examples like

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,539
screaming frog times they will run an

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,090
accessibility fine with it but then

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,550
again is going nothing will be going to

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,560
page by page it won't bring you results

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,380
ballot results are good instinct wins

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,050
but nothing of course we'll meet page by

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,760
page unfortunately because it just it's

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,130
far more accurate it's taking the full

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,440
time to run driver is phenomenal

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,800
or not and use them even the free

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
version has

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,100
[Music]

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,500
[Music]

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,099
they're clients and now I want to go to

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:11,900
them and say so crews really expensive

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:14,090
go back for ridiculous money or we can

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:24,500
make your sink compliant using these

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:26,719
tools that's great

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,430
first of all most it always hold back on

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,930
the client make that clear

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,020
it's their job to approve what edits

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,729
you're doing you're not in charge of the

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,409
damage after the fact it always falls

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,389
back on them for approval of the changes

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:41,210
in something Dumas these contracts and

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,620
for the NES itself and then it's what

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,620
that was a compliance they wanted me

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,289
odds argument let's say compliance

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,509
wasn't thought of in the process you use

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,460
any of these tools and you probably got

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,650
interesting wins for sealing compliance

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,930
and one a lot that's already done for

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,969
you and then you can run these odds by

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,759
hitting this is definitely done is all

00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,219
the things we fix there's a average

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,430
score of operating on these pages once

00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:09,469
again you will never also be certified

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,810
in compliance so the lawyers before

00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:15,310
orders

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,620
and because we're neither of those we

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,690
can actually never stay this is a

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,220
hundred percent compliant you've done

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,900
the word teammate complaint all these

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,500
rules all these checklists and let's

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,080
provide it to you and now take your jobs

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,540
done you are compliant if they you know

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,550
then it goes laughing it's really good

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,930
ingredients as people arguing about well

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,789
you know it should be like this and it

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,169
just following they did the steps and

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,539
there's in these links there's also

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,089
checklist from macadam selves is this

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,830
done for single any of this done if you

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,120
can do it through that I was like how

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,570
most doesn't call me already done it for

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,910
you I don't know we picked up give them

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,339
that like don't you go we have to based

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,880
off the standards you want to meet we go

00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,860
done

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,750
if you want to go ahead with that like

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,830
you want to go to double it's going to

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,830
take these things to do that

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,440
[Music]

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,610
so that there's there's a lot but it's

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,610
also very some that's also that's also

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,750
the problem and we talked to one man a

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,210
little bit on the lever and they're like

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,110
hey you reckon changes also have

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:37,080
improved they go on vacation so it goes

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,530
there so stated hey these things aren't

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,420
done excuse me well we just met this

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,280
that has happened the time that I've

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,080
been through that myself so it's kind of

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,360
like there is a lot of back and forth

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,410
and there's some Wild West stuff but the

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,260
point is if you can go like hey

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,640
regardless of what you said this is what

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,140
well technically the losses on the

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,410
internet for compliance and I've done

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,090
these things okay you're always going to

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,130
have some little comfort and being

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,100
cutter but that's your tip doing stuff

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,820
and only you know it's not it's a grain

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,040
of salt

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,560
so to speak because it's always things

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,330
you argue with and say blah blah blah

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,710
well no I'm surviving this and I said

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,710
yes I bet you are

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,100
[Music]

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:36,480
the only issue so let's try to stick

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,850
away from CAPTCHAs this much awesome I

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,900
go to the honeypot now I always go money

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,190
pot always I think it's personally first

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:52,710
thing I think it's just as good if not

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:58,430
way better and it's complaining awesome

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,430
so you guys oh yeah do it

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,570
there are normally so a lot like once

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,830
again single day

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,510
you really should never have to pick

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,730
single a because it's almost out of them

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,230
I've used the framework a lot of its out

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,030
of the box if you go and race with

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,070
colors and things like that that falls

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,040
on you and your staff and your people to

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,420
be like hey you guys let's rel let's

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,310
bring that back a little bit don't make

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,960
it pop and epic because there's

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,080
beautiful sites out that may you never

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,680
guess our seal double a compliant look

00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,410
awesome

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,150
but you notice there you know it'll lose

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,910
a ton of contrast in this one area but

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,000
they've done like great visual work it's

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,410
compelling it's beautiful there's like a

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,910
if that play is let's say doing

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,850
e-commerce they're trying to they're

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,560
already getting part with SEO all this

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,060
is it goes to evolve you know if you

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,170
wanted to hit double a we would need all

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,470
this text to go to 200% and not break

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,160
the contextual space now you need to

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,990
oversensitivity

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,050
massive the word does gonna take a

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,850
retired page that's okay because it's

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,040
not breaking the layout so what you

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,360
think anything else we recommend they

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,710
stop what you're doing it'd be nice to

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,900
have some of these standards intimate

00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,380
we're not suggesting you have to do all

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,540
of them

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,520
cuz you should already single a by

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,350
default for the most part but there's a

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,800
lot of stuff you always want to try to

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,220
make double a and then when it's against

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,180
a budget like okay we can pull that

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,480
frankly quite a go we would suggest

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,910
doing this if that's not that's okay you

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,570
say don't walk at that's fine but double

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,000
a isn't horribly harder after the fact

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,380
so that's the kind of job you was go for

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,510
that's probably normal flood won't be an

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,960
issue going back on the fact that that's

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,120
work

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,070
sláinte work but always got one these

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,670
are suggested to have makes dr. Kern SEO

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,400
scores renting new user usability which

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,310
is huge you know durability for users

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,310
potentially leads to additional returned

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,680
to us and although I say hey that's an

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,000
additional click or the reader and how

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,530
much you know in their demographic who

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,900
their users are and you're making it

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,540
better for them and make it a

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,590
potentially a return on investment just

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,590
for maybe compliant

00:13:38,700 --> 00:14:08,760
all right thanks guys so here I hope the

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:21,610
best site you've ever seen age was tap

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:24,040
enter escape Bacchus anyone tell me

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,670
what's wrong with the floor already my

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,770
wife in the forum compliant good

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,770
[Music]

00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:38,529
well uh low contrast and there's no

00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:41,759
label go through here keep em focused on

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:46,029
that focus on these great fantastic

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,559
buttons spacebar it amusing any slider

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,029
on the planet although I was only doing

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,049
this I will slide or anything else or

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:54,789
frameworks matter it's already in it

00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,470
that being said you ever gonna was

00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,349
talking people like unless there's spam

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,629
tag inside the button in the slider but

00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:03,599
the commies hidden that's because it's

00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:06,909
been planning to use the screen reader

00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:09,369
you pull up that button to have a label

00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:11,289
or text inside of it so screen will get

00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:13,720
a good home next slide

00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,519
current slide it should be even that's

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,649
why that text updates and those sliders

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,949
you see people delete that like oh well

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:24,759
just a money no no no it's in the text

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:26,739
image for a reason so who's going

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,959
through buttons don't big deal so we

00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:32,139
need sweet just have a long close is

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,369
super super basic example you notice how

00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,409
they skipped any type of section because

00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:37,149
it still links so natural users well

00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:38,350
it's just it's just content you're not

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:44,470
going to tap through that technically

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:48,579
speaking and let's go back up use of

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:50,999
these super hot tools oh it's just

00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:54,399
default throne let's go over here

00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:56,049
awesome tool it's called my house for

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,739
your browser as far as something much

00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,939
similar

00:15:56,739 --> 00:16:01,539
I believe it's maybe the same thing

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:05,729
anyone to use that probably that's a

00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:07,779
similar night and exhale as you notice

00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:10,509
it's not the only thing here this

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,589
practice performance SEO by the way SEO

00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,749
has in fact is all placed into

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,729
accessibility let's just run him on a

00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:17,109
random bottom on the page you should be

00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:18,970
using this tool for all of your websites

00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,309
it's going to give you freebies

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,160
interested Hwang's instant gratification

00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:25,220
for

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,350
that's top seven - that sucks

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:34,850
you should be 9200 so what's wrong

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:36,800
all of these images no alt tags now a

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,160
big decorational then they don't need

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,980
descriptions they just name the tag they

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:54,980
just need to tap form elements that form

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:59,350
the top no label color contrast this is

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,350
we're gonna fight your desires to death

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,390
right color contrast is huge and in the

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,860
tool there's baked in references that we

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:14,510
click up here just real quick both color

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:16,069
testers it's compliant a size yes ball

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,410
size has compliance based on the

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:29,390
standard we're trying to reach it can't

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:31,040
be rough let's go back to the tool right

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,560
here so some slides will come with other

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,080
elements baked in tonight that's wrong

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,850
the buns we saw for left and right are

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,310
incorrect they should not be in the

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,380
slider it should be outside of the order

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,510
of the list put them somewhere else

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,030
don't base stuff into an ordered list

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,190
with their slides or anything else you

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,450
do that inside of this time conflict is

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,440
all that stuff because it's following an

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,190
order of operation good to go

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,350
and course there's some additional

00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,840
sanity checks everything we've done

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,080
directly and by the way this page was

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,380
just this out of the box no extra work

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,020
just order of operations new buttons

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,510
correctly stepping down whatever you use

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,460
immediately or anything you do already

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,179
so that's no you're alright

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:21,770
compliant a lot you know it's not hard

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:31,850
it doesn't have to be scared that being

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:36,919
said questions let's do it we come to

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:41,169
mind please you have to flip the switch

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,169
to turn it on that flip the switch on

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,190
[Music]

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,559
[Music]

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:08,270
right with this attack if you want to

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,360
use if you want to use Chrome for your

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,039
website any page load it up use the

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,110
plug-in lighthouse and you just run that

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,110
exact thing I did that's gonna be that

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,559
there are like there's yes select

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,010
examples like screaming frog they will

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,260
run into accessibility fine with it but

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,990
then again is going nothing will be

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,470
going to page by page it will bring you

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,169
results

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,029
Baldur's also good instinct wins but

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,890
nothing of course we'll meet page by

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,200
page unfortunately because it's just

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,940
it's far more accurate it's taking the

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,429
full time screaming frog rubber is

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,049
phenomenal for nam and if you use them

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,590
even the free version has accessibility

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,590
stop line

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:57,720
yes so there are existing clients and

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,520
now I want to go to them and say so

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,470
Santa Cruz really expensive you can go

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,140
back for a ridiculous amount of money

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm going for we can make your Saint

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:16,440
compliant using these tools so that's

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,060
great

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,340
first and foremost it always hold back

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,660
on the client make that clear and it's

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,930
their job to improve what edits you're

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,790
doing you're not in charge of the damage

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,170
after the fact it always falls back on

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,510
them for approval of the changes and

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,000
something to dosti contracts and for

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,130
that it's itself and then it's what does

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,530
a complaint state wanted me on its

00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,930
argument let's say compliance wasn't

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,150
thought of in the process you would use

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,100
any of these tools and you probably got

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,840
interesting wins for sealing compliance

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,330
and you're the one that's already done

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,950
for you and then you can run these odds

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,400
of like heading this is definitely done

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,420
is all the things we fix there's a

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,650
average score of operating on these

00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,900
pages once again you will never also be

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:06,060
certified in compliance so the lawyers

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:09,030
before martyrs and because we're neither

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,160
of those we can actually never say this

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,820
is a hundred percent compliant you've

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,529
done the work to make complaint all

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,860
fools all these checklists and that's

00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:20,559
provided to you and now technically your

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,169
jobs done you are compliant if they you

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,179
know then it goes like it's really good

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:29,559
ingredients as people arguing about well

00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:31,450
you know it should be like this and it

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,799
just following they did the steps and

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,960
there's in these links there's also

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,570
checklist from the catacombs cells is

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,759
this done for single any of this done if

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,929
you can go through that like most

00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,649
doesn't call me already done it for you

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,809
I know we picked up give them that like

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:50,230
don't you go we up to based off the

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:51,639
standards you want to meet we go done if

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,500
you want to go ahead with that like you

00:22:51,639 --> 00:23:10,029
want to go to double its going to take

00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:14,379
these things to do that so then there's

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:16,990
there's a lot but it's also very some

00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:18,730
that's also that's also the problem we

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,950
talked to one man or woman or the

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,190
leopard and they're like hey you reckon

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:27,340
changes also have approved they go on

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:30,490
vacation so it goes there so skating hey

00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,460
these things aren't done excuse me

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,480
well we just met this that is half the

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,210
time that I've been through that myself

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,710
so it's kind of like there is a lot of

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,750
back and forth and there's some Wild

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,899
West stuff but the point is you can only

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,279
pay regardless of what you said is what

00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,779
well technically the losses on the

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,049
internet for compliance and I've done

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,700
these things okay you're always going to

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,769
have some level of comfort and being

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,860
covered but that's your tip doing stuff

00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:59,470
and only you know not it's a great move

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,389
salt so to speak because it's always

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,809
things you can argue with and say a lot

00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:25,859
of law well no I'm sorry

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:27,570
I said yes I bet you are so let's try to

00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:30,119
stick away from CAPTCHAs this much

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,460
awesome I go the honeypot now I always

00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,529
go anymore

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,789
always I think it's personally first

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:46,339
thing I think it's just as good if not

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:46,339
way better and it's complaining awesome

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,049
[Applause]

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,049
[Music]

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,029
there are normally so a lot like once

00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:28,499
again single day usually should never

00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,779
have to pick singly because it's almost

00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:32,519
out of them I've used the framework a

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,779
lot of it out of the box if you don't

00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,269
race with clothes and things like that

00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,059
that falls on you and your staff and

00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,679
your people to be okay you guys let's

00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,809
pray let's bring that back a little bit

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,460
don't make it pop and epic because there

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:46,710
was beautiful sites out there they you

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,869
never guessed apart still double a

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,359
compliant look awesome but you notice

00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:53,039
that you know they don't use a ton of

00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,529
contrast in this one area but they've

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,649
done like great visual work it's

00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:00,029
compelling it's beautiful there's like a

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:01,679
if that plane is let's say doing

00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:04,529
e-commerce they're trying to do they're

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,450
already getting hard with SEO all of us

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,889
it goes to evolve you know if you wanted

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,989
to hit tumbling we would need all this

00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:15,149
text to go to 200% and not break the

00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:16,710
contextual space now you need to

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:18,809
understand it's gonna be massive the

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,210
word does gonna take an entire page

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,089
that's okay because it's not breaking

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,559
the land so what you think anything else

00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,639
we recommend they stop what you're doing

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,320
it'd be nice to have some of these

00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:29,789
standards implemented we're not

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,950
suggesting you have to do all of them

00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,599
cuz it already you should already single

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,729
a by default for the most part but

00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,460
there's a lot of stuff you always want

00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:40,409
to try to be a double a and then when

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,679
it's against a budget like okay we can

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:46,409
pull that frankly I think oh we would

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,879
suggest doing this if that's not that's

00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:52,499
okay if you say don't want that that's

00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:54,989
fine but double-a isn't horribly harder

00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:56,159
after the fact so that's kind of showing

00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,830
you is go for that's probably normal

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,590
flood will be an issue going back a fact

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,750
now that's worth

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,400
sláinte work but always got one these

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,419
are suggested to have makes doctor Kern

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:10,029
SEO scores renting new user usability is

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:12,940
huge you know durability for users

00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:15,940
potentially leads to additional return

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,309
to us and although I say hey just an

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,630
additional click or the reader and how

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,130
much you know in their demographic who

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,529
their users are and you're making it

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,539
better for them and make it a

00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:31,659
potentially return on investment

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:34,320
just for may be compliant all right

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,320
thanks guys

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,640
