Title: Joshua Giowaya: Legos for Developers - A Modular Approach to WordPress Development (Gutenberg E...
Publication date: 2020-04-08
Playlist: WordCamp Seattle 2018
Description: 
	Letâ€™s explore the benefits of thinking in reusable blocks. Atomic design, Modular Development, and D.R.Y. methodology improves productivity, enhances UI and empowers authors. We will explore multiple methods to achieve modularity in our WP themes. Leveraging the WordPress templating system and Advanced Custom Fields or Using blocks in the form of Gutenberg. Regardless of if you are ready to learn Javascript deeply and embrace Gutenberg or set in your ways and sticking with the classic editor. You will leave this talk excited and ready to integrate this strategy into your workflow.

okay good afternoon everyone we have

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,580
Joshua chia-wei here Joshua G Waya is a

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,650
senior front-end developer at code 42

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,350
who started his career as an

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,630
ActionScript and Flash designer he has

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,550
an extensive background in design that

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,980
has proven invaluable were contributing

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,179
to the design process and communicating

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,150
with creative teams

00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:30,730
he stays extremely active in the

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,650
WordPress community regularly attempting

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,480
and speaking at work camps and meetups

00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,580
he hopes to give back to a community

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,160
that has shared so much knowledge with

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:43,270
him give a warm welcome to Joshua Tree

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,270
[Applause]

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,240
thank you though organizers this has

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,160
been an awesome event so far thank you

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,350
for coming to my talk and sticking

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:59,800
around for their last talk on the last

00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:01,720
day or so I said my name is Jeffery geo

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,850
a.m. I was senior front-end developer at

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,369
code 42 we developed a software called

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,039
CrashPlan helps companies backup and

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,259
restore their desktops and laptops and

00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,810
devices I've been doing this for about

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:16,840
12 years now started with flash and

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,869
ActionScript development which just died

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,469
on the vine one day so it's always fun

00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:25,060
back to reinvent your career so I'm not

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:27,460
afraid of change so who's murdered

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,079
doesn't really scare me and I was happy

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,350
to embrace it on a project earlier this

00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,749
year this is Michael's for developer a

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,060
modular approach to WordPress

00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,670
development it's been really great

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,149
implementing this as a workflow at code

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,920
42 it's made my life I'm actually easier

00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,040
and made our communication

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,580
with our design and content partners so

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,369
much easier we'll be talking about today

00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,979
is what is modularity why would you want

00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,899
to change your approach to modular

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,149
modular approach we'll walk through some

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,970
wireframe the website on the process we

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:06,009
had a code 42 moving away from page

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,580
templates and using and getting into

00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,929
reusable modules they'll be given a repo

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,819
where you can get started today with

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,370
that approach and then we'll talk about

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,900
the American atomic design how do we get

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,800
started with modularity was in part

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,720
today as well Legos you know I love

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,250
these things they're so great they come

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,380
with a set of instructions you can go

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,280
that way or you can build wrong path and

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,500
build your own there this is my hometown

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,200
of Minneapolis Minnesota Mall of America

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,150
I think they probably had to follow

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,560
instructions to get this one done not

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,810
sure pretty complex stuff but I would

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,450
say the developers we do pretty complex

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,790
things as well so breaking down into

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,530
modules or blocks and making it more

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,299
consumable it's an awesome thing right

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,299
now I just need two volunteers from the

00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,780
audience come on and the hosts the last

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,190
day too

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,320
you don't want to close the Legos you

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,380
came to talk about Legos you don't want

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,480
to play with Legos we've got one got one

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:15,459
come on okay ladies thank you for

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,519
volunteering so I designed this awesome

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,859
Lego website and I'm gonna need you two

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,650
to recreate it one of you is gonna have

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:25,840
the modular approach and one of you is

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,950
going to add the current approach you

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,050
can take by learning and you

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,050
[Music]

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,440
there's probably mr. piece I've done

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,240
that a couple times so this is our kind

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,640
of workflow right we have all these code

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,740
snippets and past projects that we use

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,390
and we get out a project and we're like

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,860
oh I know I've done that carousel before

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,990
them to go over here copy paste this

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,060
code I remember where I did that before

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,190
I remember I saw that before we're

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,510
trying to piece it all together based on

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,150
these little snippets that we've had

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,040
throughout time and this is a modular

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,930
approach where we look at this as a

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,620
reusable pattern that we've seen before

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,020
and decide that the onset of our project

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,459
that we're going to make it reusable so

00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,820
we can transfer it from project to

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:22,720
project and also reuse it in our current

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:24,400
project so there's a fierce race he

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,200
actually got a pretty good at that start

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
because normally oh you got a winner

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:38,440
thank you so much about dancing

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:41,850
oh you're low you can just think I'll

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,850
take care of that thank you

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,540
so I think there's three things to

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,210
understand when you want to go modular

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,280
you want to get into this workflow the

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,140
first is having a patter language or a

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,910
shared way to talk about these modules

00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,130
that make sense to everybody in the

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,740
project there's a book about this with

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,040
my career Alexander where he came up

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,010
with 253 patterns and talents and

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,870
instruction so we all are some of us

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,140
work in offices these are a couple of

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,830
those tactics flexible office space you

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,680
know eating small work groups reception

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,420
welcomes you a place to wait right so he

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,820
came up with this language where

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,530
everyone understands this is what we're

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,840
talking about when we say these things

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,530
and that's the first part of Cohen

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,990
modular super-important the second part

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,180
is anatomic design strategy this is

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,670
created by a guy named Brad Frost and as

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,370
five distinct stages to make your code

00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,880
more deliberate hierarchical the stages

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,730
are atoms molecules organisms templates

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,620
which we currently use for workflow and

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:54,440
pages which we also currently is not

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:57,970
alone this is the integrative interface

00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,980
and so I like to think of atoms as

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,050
typography color theory I turn ography

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,060
and then two or more atoms make a

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:12,230
molecule and molecules make up organisms

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:14,360
organisms modules and blocks are kind of

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,280
interchangeable nomenclature when we're

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,820
talking about doing modularity of atomic

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,160
design within WordPress then you see the

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,370
organisms make a template those

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,230
templates make up page so let's take a

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,250
look at another familiar interface you

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,220
got our atoms here

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,430
typography colors theory they're making

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,330
our molecules then our organisms or

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:46,050
modules or blocks remain with

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:51,659
the page and we see that you know this

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:55,669
is reusable all over the place there's

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:59,849
another view where once again for usable

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,919
and the third part is modular design by

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,319
a guy named Nathan Curtis and it's

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,500
comprised of two patterns constant

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,659
patterns and display patterns a Content

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,969
pattern is a reoccurring design problem

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:14,879
suspect we use many times and never use

00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:17,250
the same way twice in a display pattern

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:24,259
describes the Pacific rendering applied

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:27,599
to multiple content patterns so this is

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:30,030
yelps style guide or pattern library and

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,969
this is where all three of those things

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,729
kind of come together you see we have a

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:39,029
very deliberate namings user passport

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:42,240
full passport medium passport standard

00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,860
passport so if someone were to say let's

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,110
up the font size on the standard

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,969
passport everybody in the project and

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,889
know what they're talking about and we

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,379
give a look at how the content is going

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,139
to be rendered as you can see it's the

00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,360
same content pattern right we have an

00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,089
image from one side information about

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:06,270
the image to another side and it's being

00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:10,039
rendered different ways each time we can

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:15,210
see that very same content better

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:20,400
rendered in a different display back and

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:22,469
again so it was really cool about what

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,810
make the courteous kind of describes and

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,909
talks about is like we saw earlier from

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,580
the demo this is kind of our current

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:31,469
ideal workflow and where we have all

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,370
these snippets and pieces and we want to

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,860
build this really

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,510
deliberate thing we can do that and it

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,460
works but if we categorized and look at

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,580
these things and call them out on the

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:48,440
onset of the project we can build

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,440
multiple things with those same pieces

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:59,150
what are the advantages dry color more

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,630
collaborative and iterative process and

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:05,250
power add mint and content editors we

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,260
don't want to write the same carousel

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,910
code over and over again or the same

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,860
hero manner over and over again well the

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:16,080
only thing that changes is they want

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,980
body text when they want to buttons this

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,750
approach had broken waterfall it broken

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,790
we get in a room and begin of a project

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,130
a project tick off everyone's excited

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,080
you get their stakeholders there your

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,530
signers or your concentrators there and

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,480
then we go away for two or sometimes

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,940
three months we get the content that

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,650
right cool without the start design and

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,600
design goes away for two maybe three

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,580
months we get design back or like cool

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,350
anomalies start development development

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,090
goes away for whatever time is left in

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,990
the project scope which is only two

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,080
weeks and then we come back and present

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,040
this project to the client who hasn't

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,440
been in the womb for nine months and

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,660
there are what if I remember this what

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,730
is this and no one's happy so what I say

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,070
more collaborative and iterative what I

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,350
mean is we're looking at these things

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,930
and a modular level we're talking about

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,120
these things and verbage alert so we can

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,630
all understand and we're iterating on

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,880
them as we're creating each module in

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,740
these clock we're saying hey content

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,340
does this look right for the data schema

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,260
yeah that's right we're saying hey hey

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,780
design does this look right for her to

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,170
display there yeah what's good hey

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,730
developers everything

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,350
is there anything else that we need to

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,579
change before we call this one block

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,620
module good do you get true ads out with

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:45,600
this I mean you could have a two-week

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,300
sprint order you do run for three months

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,790
and empower admit the content editors at

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,250
code 42 are content editors have created

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,769
over 500 landing pages and one thing is

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,370
above any deaf intervention we started

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,990
with 13 modules we now have 22 and if

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,459
you can imagine naked we can figure them

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,829
in any order so they can make some

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,360
really unique layouts without having to

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:09,399
come back to their development team and

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,620
say hey we need this or hey we need that

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:20,350
that way we get to work on new features

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:21,459
all the time so how do we get here well

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,950
the first thing we need to do is

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:29,079
identify the pattern is it a Content

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:32,880
pattern or design pattern categorize

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:35,050
with a lot of time to all get Mata and

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,790
even if they don't follow atomic

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,180
designer haven't broken it down into

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:42,850
modules I'll take the entire design

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,870
layout and screenshot everything I think

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,279
is a similar content pattern and then

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,440
make sure that I have a display pattern

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:57,100
that accounts for all the different use

00:11:50,440 --> 00:12:00,730
cases so when we started our project

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,829
all we had was live frames the content

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,380
team had been working on the project the

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:07,240
design team can with the wireframes and

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,070
we were able to start development right

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,430
then there so we were able to start

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,470
planning how our content patterns soon

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,350
as we've got the wireframes and start to

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,199
talk about hey are you really going to

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,079
need an extra button you know how many

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,390
headlines we gonna have you know super

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:29,079
powerful to get a leg up on development

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,810
right away it amazing so how do we

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,930
categorize those patterns content

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,360
pattern you can use an ACF field how

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,699
many you guys are familiar with ACF cool

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,110
I'm new you guys use flexible content

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:45,410
with ACF better so you can just start

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,029
categorizing

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,959
the content headers right away using a

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,359
co design patterns we have individual

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:58,699
sass file for each one of our modules or

00:12:53,359 --> 00:13:00,559
orbital firms so this is what our style

00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:03,949
guide looks like and this is how we got

00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:06,979
to our templates and our modules then

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:09,679
get Adams like I said no typography

00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:11,720
color theory you have molecules made up

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,349
of two or more atoms we have organisms

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,479
and that's reusable everywhere see it in

00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:23,329
our template reconfigurable works for it

00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:28,129
how do we organize our sacks well an

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:32,089
overarching SAS files we put our color

00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:33,829
typography and hydrogen molecules we put

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,099
that in our steam and our theme our

00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:41,409
layouts SAS house and then organisms or

00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:44,149
modules they get their own SAS problem

00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:47,089
so this is what it looks like on the

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,850
back end after we've traded the modules

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:56,179
and we can reconfigure them using ACS

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:58,729
and flexible content and this is the

00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:02,209
actual cold form of the matos this is a

00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:03,979
hero module here and if you see it's

00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:08,509
pretty basic stuff if you give it use

00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:14,809
excess before this is the individual SAS

00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:16,729
pile and then we use a CF JSON to make

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:20,389
sure that all of our modules and our

00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:22,129
constant patterns are synced with all of

00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,629
our developers I don't know if you guys

00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:26,119
are familiar with that or not but you

00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,889
just create a folder called a CF JSON

00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:31,909
plop it right in your theme directory

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:35,779
and it automatically hashes every time

00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:40,759
you change one of these modules are

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:43,220
filled values so this is what it looks

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,159
like on the back end so we have all our

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,399
configurable content options here I like

00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,450
to add a theme option so they can decide

00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,920
what of the color theories

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,720
they want to apply her but give them the

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,120
ability to centre the continent where

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,620
they want and then of course if you've

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,700
ever used this before you know I just

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:09,570
kind of slide pops up reconfigurable

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:15,450
hold ill and a new section here it's

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:17,250
also so how do we achieve this in our

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,950
code we use something called a template

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:27,360
part I mean if you're familiar with that

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:29,400
cool so this is a module page template

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,500
and basically what it's doing is it's

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,900
just grabbing all our modules that we

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,040
predefined in ACF it's calling another

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,070
function that's going to loop through

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,210
those if we don't have any defined we're

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,400
gonna call another function that's

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,260
actually going to bring back the content

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,990
of that painter Poulsen stick and this

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,020
is what the model loop does it finds out

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,590
what the field name is and then it uses

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,150
our directory names vet constructor to

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:01,080
string replace and make sure that it's

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:04,470
grabbing the correct line and then once

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,270
we grab that module we locate template

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,530
part and it already has a name that was

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,770
just passed to it and created in our

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:13,350
previous function we have to set the

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,420
width to set the flag to false so it

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,490
doesn't only love it once because that

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,560
way if they have multiple modules on the

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:25,710
page it wouldn't render the second

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:29,040
module in that series this is a link to

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:31,710
a repo and where you can download a

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,670
theme that's a safe theme and that's all

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,670
this code in it already

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,400
so we kind of hard I saw all the

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,520
flexible content stuff might be whatever

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,590
thing I want to show you here so this is

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,960
the file structure over use for that and

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,030
we just put it on there templates

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,100
modules and it goes out and gets the

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,050
correct model we just look to each one

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:07,620
so we don't have to worry about calling

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:11,890
each one each time so Gutenberg and

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:15,550
atomic design this is the coolest thing

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:18,640
that been I feel like for someone takes

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:21,850
this approach because it is super easy

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,710
to get started with and it's amazing we

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:27,780
did a project earlier this year using

00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,780
Gutenberg and it couldn't be easier

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,250
so this is how the same structure that

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,410
we were talking about just kind of legs

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,920
out of middle-earth Gutenberg has this

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,740
awesome

00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,860
sidebar feature where you can have your

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,710
user-defined dislike typography color

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,510
theory and that's where we like to keep

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:52,480
our atom level stats our molecules are

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:55,060
comprised of the components that Merv

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,680
has predefined in it or if you want to

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,020
roll your own component you can do the

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,150
same and a block is basically equal to

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,980
organism those organisms create

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,980
templates those tempos great layers

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,240
there's a rebuttal called break the

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,330
block and it's super easy to get started

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,490
with just an NPM package

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,490
download install it it's pretty awesome

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:32,080
so this is it actually ran this mouth

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,700
ten minutes before I walked in there so

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,350
I just ran that function on NPM and it

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:46,899
just went ahead and created my

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:49,090
Guttenberg block plugin and it does a

00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:50,950
really good job organizing your file

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:55,059
structure and calling out the thing

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:57,760
genius so let's take a look at that we

00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:02,860
have our block here first thing we need

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,590
to do is register all of that right here

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,289
we're just registering our blood get the

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:13,029
name of the file or deprive it from what

00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:15,460
CSS to use on the editor side right here

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,990
we're creating a buck but it's terminal

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,409
block type we're passing it these

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,539
variables title our icon what category

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,840
it goes into in the Gutenberg interface

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:28,870
and then keywords for searching for the

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,399
user this is our edit function where we

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:36,610
define a props and there's our save

00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:40,510
function where we tell the block what to

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:45,340
render out based on the initial props we

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:49,210
allow them dead and endures the assess

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,690
defines CSS you what the user is seeing

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:55,179
the editor and then style.css defined

00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:01,360
what you want the user to see on the

00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:04,539
front side and it's simple we just

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,769
import block one thing about this plugin

00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:11,049
is they use webpack so you might need to

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:18,630
know a little bit about that but pretty

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:18,630
and lightly and then here's our block

00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,490
pretty simple did this about 10 minutes

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:27,460
earlier drag and drop you get all this

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:34,000
functionality out of the box pretty

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:36,639
sweet that sidebar so clock right here

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,879
so you never sealed another one if you

00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,879
want

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,320
there's some resources if you want to

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:52,880
get started with atomic design modular

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:59,850
development model described the G's

00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:02,570
there's some Gutenberg resources that's

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,570
it questions

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:15,590
I assume that the moment Gutenberg

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,600
blocks can't be used in other areas of

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,600
sight like sidebar as a header footer

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,010
just in there not really just for the

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,860
content with the blocks that you create

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,640
using Gutenberg blocks I can't do the

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,590
sidebars

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,510
not currently I mean there might be a

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,470
plug-in or a repo or something like that

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:35,180
but not out of the box now what would be

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:40,280
here I'll come with your desired outcome

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:44,360
for doing something like that oh you

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,340
know I mean I can imagine where I would

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,960
you know if you mean we still use

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,550
sidebars we still use headers and

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,800
footers and if we're you know we're

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,050
unifying the process of creating blocks

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,730
and started to use Gutenberg it would be

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,120
nice to centralize that rather than have

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,160
two different systems of creating robots

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,920
well it would be nice if they did that

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:07,400
and gave it also namespace so you could

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,690
reuse you could use the reuse function

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,690
of Gutenberg everywhere and

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:29,539
when you we're kind of talking about

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:33,530
making custom blocks did you have any

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:37,070
experience yet with ACF beta that helps

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,570
make blocks you know I haven't any

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,450
experience with it I've been following

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,250
and reading up on it but if they do end

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,419
up doing that it'll be a really smooth

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:49,190
transition for anyone who used the ACF

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,870
way to create modules and want to

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,520
integrate that into Google Earth but I

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,260
had a test never tried it but if I'm

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,270
hoping it the project turns out well

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,000
yeah I tried something because we

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,650
already do for our company we already do

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,940
a modular approach very similar to what

00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,419
you're doing we're using flexible

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,150
content and migrating some flexible

00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:10,520
content to blocks with the advanced

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,049
custom fields Gutenberg blog stuff is

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:20,840
pretty seamless soon you didn't have to

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:23,380
write reactors really yeah okay more

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,380
questions

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:37,429
come on all right oh you just put a

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:38,820
pretty one first okay okay well thank

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:48,180
you

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:48,180
[Applause]

00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,220
