come to this and please guys thanks for

00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:14,720
coming to my talk about evaluating

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:19,670
plugins how many of you have installed a

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,400
plug-in repository how many of you have

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,060
purchased a plug-in from a source other

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,369
than the number posit Orion

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,040
oh and how many of you have read look

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,600
women

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,670
awesome Wow so we've met have been

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,790
through care and we're going to talk

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,250
today a little bit about the power

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,460
that's behind WordPress and that's what

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,970
ends I've been dealing with data-driven

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,369
websites for a pretty long time I

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:53,009
started blogging and developing damaged

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,229
urban sites about the same time the

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,929
original blogging tools that came out

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,300
didn't use a database and when WordPress

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:03,539
came on and was using a database I said

00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,130
this is the way to do it because what

00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,289
the other blogging tools were doing were

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,780
generating all of these HTML files so

00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:12,980
managing these sites became very very

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,870
difficult so having a database actually

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,700
managing the site content behind the

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,930
site made a lot of sense at the time

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,920
there were no plugins you had one plugin

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,200
called Hello Dolly

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,290
which I think unit has it busting your

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,709
depression installs of WordPress and the

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,100
idea behind plugins had been planted but

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:38,670
not fully explored the way

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,890
today I have been working for wordpress

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,860
over the past few years I started

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,310
cleaning sites I thought that sounded

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,900
fun it was a lot of fun and then moved

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,600
into doing a number of different things

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,210
so I've seen some things and from my

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,060
work there I've learned a lot about why

00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:01,860
plugin management is important and I

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,710
wanted to share that today so our goals

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,350
today are to learn some strategies to

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,540
really extend WordPress I mean what did

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,180
WordPress start out doing it was a

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,540
blogging platform it was not designed

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,050
initially to be a data-driven website

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,820
that was in heaven commerce happened and

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,370
all kinds of other things but with the

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,550
power of plugins WordPress really turned

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,640
into the ability to have small site

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,980
owners develop data-driven sites that

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,580
really extended the power of what they

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,280
can do or so we're going to look at

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,800
which ones are right for the job if a

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,170
plugin is high quality if it's actively

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,840
being developed will it last

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,840
because once you plug in plug it into

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,170
your site you start entering data into

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,240
the system and so extracting that data

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,920
and bringing it into a new system can be

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,890
kind of difficult so it's important to

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,110
evaluate a plug-in before you make a

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,780
commitment kind of like and I'm getting

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,880
married so we'd like to also look and

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,490
see if plugins are safe and we'll have

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,820
some fun with some plug-in horse and

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,040
race so what is a plug-in now you've

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,730
probably seen themes and plugins as ways

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,920
to customize WordPress themes typically

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,990
deal with the layout of the site and

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,940
what it looks like to the end user

00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,720
that's visiting your site whereas

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,840
plugins

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,900
generally speaking deal with extending

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,090
functionality they can also add to your

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,700
site's layout higher so what can a

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,130
plugin do there's an adage in the

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,250
WordPress world of there's a plug-in for

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,720
that of the most popular plugins some of

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,510
the functionality that's added are

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
contact forms search engine optimization

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,930
making your site more friendly for

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,930
google ecommerce anti-spam backup

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,140
plugins and also security those are the

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,540
top plugins in the repository right now

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,670
so plugins that we said are something

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,410
that turned to a basic blogging platform

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,550
into a fully functional data-driven

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:11,400
website that supports your business a

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,280
plugin brings your site to life much

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,920
like Frankenstein's monster and of

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,730
course with that power comes great

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,000
responsibility

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,950
I mean playing with fire basically you

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,170
can start a fire and keep turning keep

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,910
your home warm in a word good stove or

00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,580
in your house down

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,740
so what happens on your site is your

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,020
responsibility and so you have to make

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,960
good two state decisions based on good

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,550
data so that what you are installing on

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
your site basically becomes your

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,410
responsibility just because somebody

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,790
else wrote this code doesn't mean that

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,350
you're not responsible for your site

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,660
you're basically taking this code that

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,670
somebody else has created putting it on

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,680
your site basically you don't put into

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,090
another room on your house and you're

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,380
going to have to clean that room you're

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,800
going to have to make sure that room is

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,970
secure

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,230
you're going to have to make sure that

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,280
that room is well taken care of it's all

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,580
about performance

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,830
what will you do feel well the Dave do

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,220
what it says it's home to do and we'll

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,930
hit do no harm

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:19,320
so speaking of monsters at WordPress we

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,590
look at a lot of security issues and an

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,620
issue came up about last year with a man

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,020
named Mason Sosa what we started to see

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,630
in our safe cleaning business was that a

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,500
plugin that was in the repository had

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,920
not only back doors on it but it had the

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,500
number went to spammy sites doing a

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,090
little bit of research behind what was

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,130
happening there it was all pointing to

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,320
certain domains and obviously doing some

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,760
domain research we figured out that it's

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,090
all pointing to one person

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,020
Mason so I saw this individual was in

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,630
the UK and he had a number of very

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,270
spammy Beach businesses and was making a

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,310
lot of money and these plugins were in

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,960
the repository so if he went to the

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,820
repository and you found one of those

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,190
plugins and you had it on your site and

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,410
he updated it after he had purchased

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,590
that and install it with his back doors

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,250
and spammy content your site was ready

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,430
to make some choices business you know

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,900
the community is a wonderful thing and

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,900
the repository is a wonderful thing

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,820
because some of some of the people who

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,590
had this plug-in were noticing you know

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,750
out of he's happening we're saying and

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,840
so it was reported to the community as a

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,280
whole and at WordPress we started

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,450
researching this and

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,110
and really starting to connect the dots

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:46,800
Mason has his own problems because he is

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,900
now part of an investigation and we have

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,500
some breaking news today and I are here

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,690
beside a limousine and my CEO from where

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,370
drunks MarkMonitor is here in the room

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,470
began to he knows more about what's

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,990
happening today with the news story that

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,669
broke with the terms of London I'd like

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,550
to call him up to tell you a little bit

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,669
about what's happened with Mason and the

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,430
research that we've done and what Mason

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,380
has been trying to do this illustrates

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,060
to you some of the importance of looking

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,620
at the plugins says that are on your

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,160
site and to be a part of this community

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:35,219
within WordPress in order to understand

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:36,690
where the impact your business Erin at

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,330
the great privilege of working with

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,640
Kathy she's amazing

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:47,490
so I see some background with Mason we

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,670
haven't disclosed us in the past but we

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,570
when we published our research on him we

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,200
were contacted by

00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:00,580
person in the UK who had worked with

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,720
police regarding Mason and some of the

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,490
things that he was taking marketing

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,170
pharmaceuticals online it's actually

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:11,530
pharmacist and we ended up reaching out

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,800
to FBI in Seattle and they referred us

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:21,070
to national cyber crime in the UK and

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:27,340
and they got us to collaborate with West

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:28,360
Midlands Police to give them as much

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,760
data as we could

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,820
regarding this particular threat actor

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,890
and we did that and then you know kind

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:41,080
of go enforcement folks to do their job

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,690
and nothing came of it unfortunately and

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,970
he he sent some pretty kind of things

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,360
that the plugin and then he the plugins

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,600
that he purchased and to partnership of

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,490
he was using them to inject ads for pay

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,750
headlines and for escorts escort

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,760
services in the UK and one of those ads

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,220
the escort agency ended up on a school

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:09,520
website in the UK which is obviously not

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,800
good so he's not a good chap but so

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,360
that's what happened and then we we kind

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,260
of left that and we published a pretty

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,740
extensive research on him but a

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,290
professor from UCLA who been in contact

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,370
with in the past from the bowls club

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,079
that they contacted

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,689
they wanted me to an article in The

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:36,040
Times of London that came out I think it

00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:41,889
was today talking about how this guy has

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:44,740
been foraging super supreme court orders

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:47,170
from the UK sending them to Google to

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:51,519
try to get our research the indexed

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:56,079
among other content which is very

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,329
flattering and I think in the article it

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,240
says that he he claims that it's

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:06,309
actually a company that he hired that

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,779
was was doing that so so my guess is

00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:11,019
when postman in the UK is probably

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:13,059
already aware of that and if they're not

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,800
will certainly make them aware of and

00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:18,309
one of them's probably gonna get into a

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,470
lot of trouble but but that's that's

00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,629
that's the update that's what we learned

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,120
today and it was kind of interesting and

00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:27,970
on my Twitter feed and I think the

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,980
wordfriends account retweeted it links

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,569
to the articles there including the fake

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,129
Supreme Court order so that's that's one

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,379
of the worst of the threat vectors that

00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:42,029
I would say we've encountered and I must

00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:45,009
say it's tremendously gratifying to see

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:48,249
the difference that they may be be sees

00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,800
panorama did an investigation into Souza

00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,779
and he's pharmaceutical business about a

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,730
year after we published our research on

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,660
him Sir so we're pretty happy about that

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,990
you know sort of bringing things like

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,249
this to life to light I think does good

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:08,949
and as Kathy was pointing out if you are

00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:11,199
plugging it off then it's worth

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,200
considering very carefully who you

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,510
transfer

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,490
to plant a cellular plugin or give it

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:21,529
away you're giving that new author

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,240
access to all of the websites that that

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,889
run your plugin you're essentially

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,260
giving the remote code access on all of

00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:34,790
those sites so that I'll hand it back to

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:37,550
Kathy thank you Mary that really

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,490
illustrates you know WordPress powers

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:43,880
what a third of the internet almost it's

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,410
a huge target your site is a part of

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,959
that target if you have a wordpress site

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,290
or multiple WordPress sites we've got

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:55,519
guys like this who are tracking at the

00:12:51,290 --> 00:13:02,350
bed drooling at the exposure that they

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:05,329
can gain by just basically exploiting

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:08,089
plugins so that's why it's so important

00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,070
for us to take a look at our plugins pay

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,199
attention what's happening with them pay

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,699
attention to our site and evaluate her

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,910
plugins I mean some of the plugins that

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:18,980
Mason was headed over 300,000 installs

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,959
so he was driving a lot of traffic

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,670
towards his sites and is still active so

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,170
just something to watch out for and the

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,870
plugin team you know there are a bunch

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,029
of volunteers they are much like the

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,920
contributors here at WordCamp Seattle

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:36,320
they are working out of the goodness of

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,970
their hearts to watch the plug-in

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,980
repository and make sure that it's safe

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,449
to make sure your sites are safe and

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,240
that's one of the reasons that community

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,220
powers WordPress I mean our company does

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,199
some things we keep an eye on things as

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,329
well other security companies keep an

00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,860
eye on things too but it's really the

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,290
power of the community that helps keep

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,990
things safe so you're part of it and

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,360
that's why we have this presentation so

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,510
the types of plugins the repository is

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,300
open-source so there's about 56,000 new

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,570
free and open-source WordPress plugins

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,460
some samples that

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,370
find it and installing your site contact

00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,000
form to look at post to be PC or cash

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,710
register many examples some premium

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
plugins are also available on the

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,650
repository

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,680
these are free plugins but they also

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,480
have a premium portion so that plugin

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,740
offers you know basically keep the

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,440
lights on Yoast Smosh updraft plus which

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,900
is a backup plug-in import points are

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,480
all premium plugins the majority of the

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,760
plugin is free to use but there is a

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,790
premium unlock code that will unlock

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,540
additional functionality there are also

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,760
premium commercial plugins and they are

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,420
not in the repository there are only

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,070
available after you purchase that

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,950
commercial sources like ThemeForest and

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,170
code Canyon are some samples where you

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,300
can get those plans and then there's a

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,320
plug-in type know the plugins

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:06,390
has anybody ever seen an old button and

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,790
they'll plugin is a creamy but freemium

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:12,630
or premium plugin something that you get

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,160
on code Canyon an award premium premium

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,260
plugin that's available on the

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,570
repository but it's unlocked and these

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,480
are a trap because usually we find these

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,730
plugins they have backdoors spam links

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,010
they're compromised but they've been

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,560
taken by us right after they've been put

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,140
on a website and move over at all plugin

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,060
named free unlocked something like that

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,320
you can find these little plugins but

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,240
you need to be extraordinarily careful

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,080
and I would advise against using those

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,310
so do you get what you pay for

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,470
unnecessarily I mean you've got these

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,000
plugins from the repository that are

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,050
open source and completely

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,480
the units on your site plugins don't

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,430
have visibility in the marketplace they

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,820
don't have visibility with security

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,200
researchers our security researchers

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,070
download these plugins all the time and

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,380
aren't looking for vulnerabilities

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,320
within that and we'll talk later about

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,510
how you can do that too I don't paint

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,330
plug-ins are bad but you are reliant

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,340
upon yourself to do the due diligence

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,530
and investigating whether or not that

00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,060
plug-in the state so it's really up to

00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,160
you you know we've talked about how

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,720
plugins are basically your

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,610
responsibility you're basically taking

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,130
someone else's code and taking ownership

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,270
of it in your house of your of your site

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,520
so with the repository plugins you have

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,960
an entire community behind you in terms

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,690
of investigating whether or not that

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:41,370
plug-in is a safe and good but the paid

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,610
plugins are a little bit differently

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:47,610
which leads us to another horror story

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:50,490
so I'm doing sake cleaning and this site

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,920
comes in and it's hacked to the teams

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,690
you know it's just like really a massive

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,030
one of the things that we do in our site

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,310
cleaning businesses we look for the

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,110
intrusion factor so we look how do they

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,240
get it basically so I'm looking through

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,189
the log files of all these access and I

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,130
see it as malware abscess happening and

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,589
then I come to an access called a remote

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,420
tunnel that PHP and then before that

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,030
there's no malware access is whatsoever

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,650
in the log files so I'm like but look at

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:20,430
this bike you see what's going on with

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,230
us and it was a paid plugin and well

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,829
developers don't like to talk to

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,780
end-users

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,530
because then they have to have asked

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,800
like difficult questions like what

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:33,010
we are using what version of my sequel

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,740
are you using you know parameters about

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,200
your your hosting environment and then

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,870
users often don't know and the answers

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,510
to those questions so this page for

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,520
these guys wanted to find the answers of

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,760
themselves so every one of their plugins

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,830
had Ramon Tom and they had a password in

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,550
there but it was the same Kathryn on

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,250
every site

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,380
so why the app site God knows we're

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,540
thinking that password they find our

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,760
client site and how do they use that

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,610
thing password to basically install a

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,400
backdoor and get into the rest of the

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,440
site and basically take it over so now

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,920
if this plugin was in the repository

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,000
what do you think would have happened

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,500
somebody would have found it a lot

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,450
faster because you can download any

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,790
plug-in the zip file from the repository

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm Hackett and look at the vials and

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,660
see what's in there but with these paint

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,100
plugins you have to purchase it before

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,980
you can actually see what you're getting

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,690
so with the paid plugins you know and

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,240
that's not to say that all paint plugins

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,430
are bad but it does miss the element of

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,610
community that we're prospering two

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:38,110
plugins so when you're researching

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,020
plugin this either there's some search

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,720
phrases you can use like plug-in named

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,060
hacked or vulnerability or plugin named

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,870
broke or broken or slopes I hate

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,080
performance but if you've ever treated

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,020
to do this a little blackboard

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,540
thankfully we've got the repository so

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,850
this sidebar that you see in the white

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,760
hair is on every single onion

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,160
Paige so and you can see things like

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,010
when it was last updated the active

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,530
installations and what version it was

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,200
tested up to so this is an older speech

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,510
hat but it shows you that this version

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,320
of this plug-in was tested up to version

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,360
498 and you can also see what the

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,510
ratings are there's also a link here for

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,100
advanced view so you can look and see

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,470
additional metrics about that particular

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,910
plug-in so you can tell a lot of things

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,390
you can tell if this plug is being

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,570
updated if it's been tested if it's

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,200
being supported and if it's loved by the

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,090
community

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,309
I wouldn't say any one of those factors

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,960
is the most important thing I'd say all

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,570
of those factors taken into

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,250
consideration together gives you an

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,850
accurate picture of what a plugin is

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,250
going to do for you so here's a plug-in

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,370
from the repository limit login attempts

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,100
at the top you can see that the plug-in

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,470
has not been updated for quite some time

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,120
so you look further it's got an alert

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,260
like the yellow bar I'm not sure if you

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,600
can see it on the screen there but

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,280
there's a yellow bar it basically tells

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,429
you it hasn't been updated for the last

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,130
few versions of WordPress it says it's

00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:19,059
been last updated six years ago but it

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:23,000
still has two million in installs

00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:25,039
so this plug-in safe it's not being

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,919
actively maintained it's not being

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,950
tested we don't know what my needs to

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,860
hear any problems with it I may have

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,840
this on a site still I don't know many

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,520
problems with it but you know we're

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
pressed five is coming out in a few

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,320
weeks is this going to work with

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,020
WordPress five has you just cannot trust

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,669
that it's going to be forward thinking

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,200
in terms of how it's going to work for

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,780
your sites so if you start seeing things

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,710
like this you have to be cautious about

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,110
what turns

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,510
on your site concedes in a work for you

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,580
long term

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,680
here's another plugin that had a

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,590
five-star review but if you started

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,980
looking at the support comments here you

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,680
see that it's not all support requests

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,150
on the forums are not being answered and

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,640
people are asking if it's dead if it's

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,880
being supported it off and over a year

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,590
nobody's answered any of these questions

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,510
so you see that it's not being supported

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:29,140
and it's not being updated five stars

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,580
it's almost like an Amazon review

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,010
another thing to look at is the change

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,980
lock if you go under development on a

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:40,250
plugin page and for something called the

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,580
change Mladic a change life is something

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,580
that most web software has so that

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,400
software is updated with subsequent

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,410
versions now this was from a plugin

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,030
called ultimate modern which a few

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,060
months ago had some security problems

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,460
and in the changelog they're telling you

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,020
exactly what they're doing they told you

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,720
that they fixed a number of security

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,820
vulnerabilities that were being actively

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,620
exploited and mixing up a lot of

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,980
problems with this this plugin in the

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,480
past but one thing that I really like

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,240
about this plug-in is that they're

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,760
telling you what's going on you've got

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,830
some plugins out there paid plugins and

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,750
plugins in the repository that are not

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,100
necessarily being forthright about

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,280
what's going on with their development

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,990
process they may have security problems

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,850
but they're not telling you about it in

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,770
the changelog a plugin author that's

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,240
willing to stand behind their plugin are

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,430
going to tell you what's happening with

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,870
the development and so if you see holes

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,550
like this and the changelog it means

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:43,610
that you can trust that plug-in going

00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:45,590
forward reviews reviews are such a mixed

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,710
bag aren't they he can have five-star

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,779
reviews and my sister

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,450
mean anything it's really important to

00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:55,970
read reviews and look for patterns if

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,580
you see a number of different reviews

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,950
saying you know the same thing that

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,470
they're consistently having the similar

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,960
problem across a number of sites it's

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,080
definitely a red flag but you've got to

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,610
take everything with a grain of salt

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,279
here's a resource that you can use when

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:16,090
you're researching security issues this

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,179
is the WordPress vulnerability database

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:23,390
WP bold DB and all my spikes will be up

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:26,840
on Twitter later so you don't have to

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,399
post up but just because the plugins

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,200
here doesn't mean it is currently

00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:32,450
vulnerable again you're looking for

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,390
patterns so if you see a plugin that is

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,640
consistently having security issues it's

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,590
definitely a red flag is that something

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,870
that you want to have on your site if

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,510
you constantly are seeing a plug-in with

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,399
security problems also just because a

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,720
plugin is in that database doesn't mean

00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:50,870
it's currently vulnerable

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,240
obviously you see uh Yoast version 1.7

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,570
had some security issues but it was just

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,950
been updated subsequently and no longer

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,539
has that but if you're running that

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,549
version and you know look out

00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,549
everybody's updating their plugins right

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:09,980
manage WP has a great resource where you

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,470
can take two plugins that are basically

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,809
doing the same thing and compare them

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,190
against each other so here I took the

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:21,490
SEO framework of small up-and-coming

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,840
underdog and compared it against Yoast

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,539
the comparison will give you the same

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,210
metrics that are in the repository but

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,550
it will provide it to you in

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,740
you that might help you make more sense

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,530
when you're evaluating two plugins that

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,420
do similar things so it's just another

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:42,060
way to take the same information in the

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:46,690
repository but see it in one interface

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:50,320
rips has a site called cobras and they

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,140
have security they have an algorithm

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,230
that analyzes the code and on-site and

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:59,410
or on the plug-in and basically tell you

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:02,830
they assess the score based on what they

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:05,890
think the security risk is with those

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:08,830
plugins so they have a nice little you

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,380
know green to red metric that they'll

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,050
show you here and if you dive deeper

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,370
into each individual plug-in it'll give

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,590
you some metrics that you probably

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,470
random that I'm in repository as well

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:24,130
but that nice beautiful green with a

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:27,100
zero code risk is very heartening when

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:30,550
you know that contact form 7 is 5

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,100
million sites it will also tell you the

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,560
trends so if you go back to early

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,180
versions of contact form 7 they felt

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,210
that those early versions did have some

00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,940
code risk problems but in subsequent

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,130
versions you're seeing very low risk and

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:50,020
here's a plug-in that is kind of a mass

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:51,820
says who the code risk of a hundred but

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:56,050
they're only on you know four point or

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,150
four thousand sites but according to

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,460
their metrics this is something that you

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,800
should watch out for so you can go enter

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,340
in on that site and try to plug in that

00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,530
your

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,220
waiting and see what the security risk

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,870
is according to their code risk score

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,780
you can also download the code of

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,890
applying and actually unpack that's a

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,080
file and look at those files yourself

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:23,260
there's a github link that has some

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,390
WordPress security testing metrics that

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,830
you can use in order to evaluate that

00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:33,250
plug-in you can open up each of the

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,890
files and look for anomalies where

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,960
different scans are my favorite I mean I

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,480
was a customer before I actually started

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,150
working there I had WordPress on all of

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,750
my sites because it helps you manage

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,940
plugins and obviously you know the most

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,980
important thing to do for your security

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,890
is to keep everything updated but you

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,660
have lives and maybe children and maybe

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,190
you want to walk to dinner you might eat

00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,390
you have lives that you want to live and

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,130
you don't want to sit and constantly

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,080
track your dashboard to make sure that

00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,060
all of your plugins are updated we're in

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,530
France doesn't for you basically tells

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,140
you that your plugins need to be updated

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:12,010
and it will alert you that if a plug-in

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,980
has a security problem so I highly

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:19,510
advise using word front scans to keep on

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:22,480
top of your plugins was talking about

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,460
Putin Berg these days so there's a

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,130
resource it's actually it was a database

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,090
for awhile but it's not being actively

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,390
supported anymore

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,490
it's a CSV file which is kind of

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,920
separated values you can download that

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,390
CSV file though and you can search for

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,000
the plugins that you're using or

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,660
evaluating and look and see whether or

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,640
not that plug-in is Gutenberg ready just

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,230
because it's not reading this you know

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,090
determined to not he wouldn't burn right

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,530
he doesn't mean it's not because a lot

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,040
of plugins are only running on the

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,170
background and Gutenberg is only to you

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,450
with a small portion of what's showing

00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,310
on the front of your site anything

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,990
that's going through the editor so not

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,480
every plugin is going to need to be

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,400
Gutenberg writing but if a plug-in is

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,440
dealing with trying time on the front

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,180
end of your site this is a handy

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,550
resource to go look and see if your

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,680
plugins are ready there's also a tab

00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,110
that has recently appeared on the

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,430
repository or whoever and ready but

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,200
there's only a couple of plugins that

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:23,310
are actually using that so resource

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,500
utilization

00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,420
there is a plugin called the debug bar

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,330
that's available on the repository as

00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,780
well and you can you have to turn T

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,300
buggy on your WP config file but once

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,850
you do that you can see a number of

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,790
different resource utilization metrics

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,190
on your site so this is just a

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,130
screenshot that gives you some idea of

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,520
what I'm looking at but it's a handy

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,050
tool if you're trying to figure out

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,310
performance problems that are occurring

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,660
on your site so another thing that's

00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:01,550
really important when you're dealing

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:05,250
with plugins is how user centric is this

00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:08,240
can you break up with the plug-in now is

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,740
the data that's stored in your database

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,770
related to the functions of that plugin

00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,740
say for example a calendar plug-in that

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:19,320
basically showing a calendar of events

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,750
on front end of your site say that

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,890
plugin has a serious owner ability or

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:27,750
that plugin is no longer being actively

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,010
supported by us to Bolivar what are you

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,140
going to do with that data

00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,560
can you pull it out over your WordPress

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,650
site easily or is it going to

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,720
take no feats of superhuman strength in

00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,370
order to extract that data and get it

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,650
into a plugin that is being supported

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,470
that's something that you need to look

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,630
at before you make that commitment

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:51,730
before you are actually going to start

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:56,180
storing tons of data when you're

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:57,830
managing your site and you have a new

00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,990
plugin say you've got said that's that

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,480
time plugins and everything's going on

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,670
fine but you have a new feature that

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,610
your boss has said you must have this on

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,590
your site and you're concerned with how

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:14,270
this might affect the functionality that

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:17,120
already exists it's really important to

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,970
have a staging environment on which you

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,580
can run tasks so basically take your

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,540
production website make a copy of it

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,880
somewhere else

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,910
install them and plug in there and see

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,770
how things work one thing that's really

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,230
important with staging sites from a

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,180
security perspective if you are using

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,430
something like a cPanel and you want to

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,440
do stay tuned here domain.com and most

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,990
panel lets me do that oh this is great

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,340
this is going to save me time it's

00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,200
really important that you treat that

00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,450
staging site that you're putting in the

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,340
same environment and it's your

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,660
production site that you treat it with

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,760
as much love care and support as you do

00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,610
with your production site we see a

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,400
number of half sites that somebody has a

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,810
staging site that they want just needed

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,720
to test something and then they're off

00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,100
you know doing something else and

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,540
somebody will get into that staging site

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,190
and we'll cross contaminating the

00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,320
production site so if you're doing

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,660
something like that

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,130
really important to take care and it's

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,140
really important that you don't test

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,170
things on production your production

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,450
site is something that is a reflection

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,000
of your business and an integration of

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,560
your business with your customers it is

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,540
the first thing your customers and your

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,630
prospects are going to see so it needs

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,910
to be taken care of again needs to not

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,010
have things breaking it so you're

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,950
looking for a staging environment on

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:41,500
which you can test the effectiveness

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:44,080
compatibility issues and basically see

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,710
that everything is you know going to be

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,600
copacetic

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:51,760
before you put it into production so

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,790
you've got all of these buttons and say

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,140
you moved a calendar button and so

00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,010
you're just going to deactivate the old

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,650
one it's really important to uninstall

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,810
anything that you are not actively using

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:06,670
if you are just testing a few plugins

00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,440
and then decide you're not going to use

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,640
them anymore and so you deactivate them

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,610
if they're not active on the site

00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,230
anymore so they shouldn't be a problem

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,700
but if you're not actively maintaining

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,860
them and there's a security

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,370
vulnerability that can still be accessed

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:24,880
the code is still existent on your site

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:27,730
it can still be exploited if there is a

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,550
vulnerability it's kind of like you know

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,010
digital clutter hoarders WordPress

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,650
edition to have a number of plugins

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:38,140
installed that are not being taken care

00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,820
of so it's a good practice to take any

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,130
plugins that you're not actively using

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,470
and just delete them same thing with

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,140
themes the less code you have to deal

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,360
with the better and it's really good to

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,490
audit and review your plugins

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,890
periodically you can use all of these

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,780
tools to manage your plugins but it's

00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,880
also good to every once in a while who's

00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,190
you know just a quarterly type of thing

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,470
look and see what's on your sites see if

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,230
it's still serving your needs see if

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,390
it's something that is actively serving

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,880
you and look at other plugins that may

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:13,930
have recently been LoCascio framework

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,850
very light SEO plugin that I've been

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,590
using Yoast for our Bastille framework

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,050
was like very simple when doing

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,060
everything I needed so I kind of did a

00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,010
plugin audit and looked at both of them

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,810
and to see the different functionality

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:30,040
to see if maybe I wanted to selection

00:33:25,810 --> 00:34:31,660
against which a few sites the end result

00:33:30,040 --> 00:34:34,180
of good management you often see that

00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:37,630
kind of data or that type of experience

00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:40,780
on the reviews if you're going through

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:42,400
the trial the old plugin somebody else

00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,869
is probably gone through too

00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,849
that's one of the

00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:48,249
there's undercoating types of parameters

00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,710
that I would look at to see if that

00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:52,480
plugins actually you know break all the

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,759
whole like you know do we have a

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,609
prenuptial agreement Terra where I can

00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:59,380
actually get out of this arrangement

00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,749
easily a number of plugins that have

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:06,599
extra database tables will have some

00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:09,910
kind of setting that will DMT activation

00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,670
will clean up after itself so that it's

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:16,119
not leaving remnants behind there's also

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,619
a plug-in called WP price which is

00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,440
really handy for cleaning up database

00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:22,960
messes it's really good for getting rid

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,569
of like doing that or autosave posts

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:33,609
that can clutter up your pulse is stable

00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:35,769
again the plugin e WP optimized and it's

00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,839
just a database kind of clean up to old

00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:45,640
we'll get rid of bottom spam comments

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:47,619
and auto sales and things like that yeah

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,480
definitely it also optimizes your

00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:52,299
database tables too which gives you

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,950
better performance overall as well so

00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:55,869
that's one that I have you know

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,300
basically when I start any WordPress

00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:00,300
website they have let me

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,770
that I always in stop obviously weird

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,380
for us I've seen enough

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,230
WP optimizes it's one of them contact

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,730
formed very simple one it's a lot of

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,190
people don't like contact form because

00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,510
it's a little difficult to deal with and

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,710
they like gravity for instance and it's

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,540
like that but once you get used to

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:35,630
contact form it's so simple and easy to

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:38,280
use and it stores being as well yes yeah

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:42,510
depends on the site obviously my

00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,800
personal blog just updated it's really

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,840
tempting we need to learn that WordPress

00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,940
update page where it tells you you know

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,710
core needs an update your plugins need

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,570
an update and your themes need an update

00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,090
to just click all and update everything

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:57,210
it's really wanting to do that it's

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:00,030
really good practice to not do that and

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:03,480
to go one by one and to do it on a

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,070
staging server too because some plugins

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,140
and another thing too is like if you're

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:13,260
updating from a plugin that's like 4.9

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:15,810
to 5.0 or WordPress core to 5.0 it's

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,880
incredibly important those big number

00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,950
jumps means that there are big changes

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,690
and you're going to want to run those

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,970
big changes in an environment that's

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,640
controlled where you can actually see

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,490
what's happening you can have issues

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,200
happen where a plug-in updates and it's

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,600
not taking into consideration which

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,430
version of PHP you're using and if

00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,530
you're not aware of that you might run

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,560
that update and get the white screen of

00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:43,110
docs on your site and if you're updating

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,360
all those plugins at once well which one

00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,430
of them caused that problem so it's

00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,350
really good practice to update one by

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,720
one and if your site is critically

00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,000
important and most business sites are

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,040
critically important you want to do it

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,380
on a staging server that has an

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,000
environment that is replicated from what

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,780
you have on productions that means the

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
same version of PHP the same version of

00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,500
my soup well whatever is running your

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,710
production site you want an exact

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,020
replica of that under staging server so

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,690
that when you do make that change if it

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:19,010
find on staging and breaks on production

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:22,010
there's something a mess

00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,010
yes

00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,539
[Music]

00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:50,010
like the freemium plugins okay yes the

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,780
freemium weddings typically are the ones

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,250
that are in the repository the way they

00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,130
work is that you install the free

00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,020
version and there's just probably a

00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,910
bunch of marketing asking you to upgrade

00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,210
because they want to keep the lights on

00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:05,100
but it's the same codebase and all that

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,160
the premium upgrade is doing is

00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:18,120
unlocking those features those

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:20,970
additional features that aren't parts of

00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,770
it so the majority for most premium

00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,900
plugins the majority of the

00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,480
functionality is there and then there's

00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:35,130
other just like additional and bells and

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:37,290
whistles that you unlock with you know

00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,510
you couldn't download any plugin from

00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,240
your repository premium or whatever you

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,890
can download the code unzip the files

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,090
and then look and see what's in there so

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,430
it's just you know there's different

00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,140
ways of them doing the unlocking of your

00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,390
developer who probably will go in there

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,330
and see exactly with how they're doing

00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,430
it but all that's a-that's really

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,400
available and the cool thing also about

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,380
the repository is different versions are

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,250
also available for download so you might

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,590
be able to

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,930
the most current version but you can go

00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,520
into that Advanced tab you can go back

00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,680
in time and look at you know what it

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,400
looked like a year ago and see you know

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
what's changed

00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,469
[Music]

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,420
[Music]

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:41,730
but I mean there are a number of plugins

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,920
that do that I can tell you that there

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,400
are some paid plugins that do that that

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,530
I wouldn't use but there are some in the

00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,260
repositories and three plugins that will

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,790
help you like ultimate memory yeah they

00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,740
had a security issue that they patched

00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,720
it but I've seen that that is fairly

00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,980
often that's the other thing is when

00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,070
you've got a plug-in that's got a huge

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,240
install base we had an issue this week

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:07,320
that some of you may have heard of

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,960
there's a plug-in WP gdpr compliance on

00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,420
a hundred thousand sites some very

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,250
significant vulnerabilities it basically

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,520
disappeared out of the repository and

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:19,050
then the next day he came back and

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,940
whenever something like that happens all

00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,740
the muscles go off for us

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,740
and we find some significant

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,440
vulnerabilities in what was there before

00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:32,970
that work on Supreme iam protects

00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,280
against but yeah so if it's got a large

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,160
install base you can bet your bottom

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,020
dollar that someone with a box somewhere

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,760
it's gonna find that vulnerability and

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,950
start sending their bot up looking for

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,600
vulnerable sites almost immediately when

00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,970
you've got anything over 100 thousand

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,260
they're just they're going to exploit it

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,260
as best they can fast

00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:02,310
well we're talking about not to soften

00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,260
the stage but I mean you want to have

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:08,849
something that's alerting to you to

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:11,970
plugins that need updates and once at

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:15,030
vulnerability is disclosed that WPA loan

00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:17,760
DB has an RSS feed and it's got a

00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,099
mailing list the RSS feed updates much

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,480
faster than the mailing list us and that

00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,760
will play right away if there's a

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,089
vulnerability that's been discovered and

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,800
disclosed and it'll tell you the

00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:31,440
severity of it so you might see

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,869
something like I'm an authenticated file

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,990
upload what does that say you know

00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:38,310
enough indicated file upload

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,339
I'm not thought to hate it that means

00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,619
nobody has to put in credentials on the

00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:47,970
fenty hated means it's anyone file

00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:50,310
upload it's just one PHP file that has a

00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,170
shell that allows them to do an anything

00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,570
on your site basically and though

00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,880
they'll run away and when you see

00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,730
something that says authenticated

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,650
cross-site scripting that one has to be

00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,040
an authentic it's a vulnerability but

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,660
it's the vulnerability that can only be

00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,180
exploited if someone's authenticated so

00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,430
if somebody's logged in so those are

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,530
things that you can look for but if

00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,030
you're keeping everything updated if

00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,200
you're going into your dashboard or

00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,520
using a tool that tells you to update

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:46,089
going to be okay you just have to

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:47,349
actively manage your site right and then

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:49,240
you know that's kind of like in a

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:52,329
double-edged sword because this plugin

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,400
changed amps right so somebody had a who

00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,079
was very responsible and was taking care

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,510
of that code base to the point where it

00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,089
ruined reputation so that 300,000 people

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,550
installed it that plugin developers said

00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:05,619
I'm not I'm done managing this code and

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,020
sold it to someone and you know when I'm

00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:10,240
with their with their lives and so

00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,800
everybody would then updated after Mason

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,130
took over control everyone who updated

00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,720
that plug-in got Mason's code you know

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:19,839
makes them built a room on their house

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,770
and makes them who's living you know in

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,450
the way so it's it's kind of a weird

00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,190
thing where you know there was no

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:31,210
security problem with that with that

00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,069
plugging before so it was just like a

00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,290
normal hot date and so everybody updated

00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:37,180
and then but that's how the community

00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,260
protects you because people noticed hey

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,569
no ice

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,000
escort services at the top of my site

00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:45,240
why is this happening and so they

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,710
started asking questions in the forums

00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,690
and they start saying hey look

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,329
this is happening here hey this is I

00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:56,440
just downloaded the code and it's in the

00:44:52,329 --> 00:45:00,069
code there in the house and so the

00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,470
community actually supports the people

00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:04,780
who are a part of it the community

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,030
actually supports you because those

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,270
things are alerted we're in France we

00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,950
have some signage systems proprietary

00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,950
systems in place that we are watching

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,650
when things change hands and our

00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:20,950
researchers who are constantly chopping

00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,599
the pen for more data and more types of

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:24,609
vulnerabilities to research they're

00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,339
looking at that code on a regular basis

00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:29,619
so you know we support the community we

00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:30,730
don't you know make money off of that we

00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:32,230
do it because we support the community

00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,500
and obviously it's good for our

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:38,230
reputation but you have tons of people

00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,720
around the world who are looking at the

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,780
code base of the repository which is I

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,670
think it's important that when you're

00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,960
looking for a plugin for a certain

00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,109
functionality in your site that you

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,480
never the repository at first instead of

00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:53,920
looking at like paid plugins then you

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,049
never know what you're gonna get until

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,700
you know you bite into that chocolate

00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,880
and it's like oh no there's a cherry in

00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,880
there

00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,349
[Music]

00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:27,040
yeah so when we discover a vulnerability

00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,770
there's something in the security

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,570
community responsible disclosure so we

00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,369
discover part researchers find something

00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,390
is a mess there's a couple of channels

00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:36,250
that we go through

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,140
first of all we'll contact the author of

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,910
that plugin and will disclose what we

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,040
found we do something called the

00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,390
proof-of-concept which basically says

00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,490
this is what we found

00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,800
we thought it was funky so we decided to

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:51,070
create this like method and we show how

00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,960
the vulnerability works so it's done you

00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,490
know and closed or is it it's not going

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,420
to talk to the world because there are

00:46:54,490 --> 00:47:00,580
ears listening and once that plug in an

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,440
author has been notified it also will

00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,860
notify the plugging team there's a team

00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,600
of volunteers through wordpress.org who

00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,670
are also monitoring these types of

00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,590
things we've seen a lot of times they'll

00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,720
remove the plugin from the repository at

00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,670
that time while things are being updated

00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,150
to kind of mitigate the risks of that

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,070
and also so the newbie isn't like oh you

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,900
smell the everything and you know

00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,800
accidentally installs a vulnerability

00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,290
and and then once that vulnerability has

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,540
been patched that's when the community

00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:36,460
as a whole hears about it that's when

00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:38,890
WBE won't DB publishes the proof of

00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,560
concept or publishes details about that

00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,840
vulnerability so it's not like oh I

00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,430
promise think anybody who does that is

00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,570
not doing

00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,760
what they thought responsible disclosure

00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,470
anybody was just like you know sprays it

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,140
on Twitter that hey this one's better

00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,030
vulnerability a lot of times you'll see

00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,160
chatter of like people writing things in

00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,110
the forums and another plugin teen

00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,880
monitors that and will remove those

00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:02,670
types of comments so that you know a

00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,710
whole Nura bility disclosure doesn't

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,510
happen spreading like wildfire into the

00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:13,830
wrong hands so it's another way the

00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:15,330
community attacks you yeah somebody so

00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:28,700
somebody will look better pretty quickly

00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:31,350
if it seems like it's well supported

00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,170
currently but it's also assuming that

00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:36,090
there's going to be kind of integral to

00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,580
your site in terms of functionality yep

00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,770
how can you judge whether or not or get

00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,730
an idea of whether or not be supported

00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,730
many years in the future

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:55,230
yeah I've got the Ottoman times on the

00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,720
site somewhere yeah so I mean it's a big

00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,610
risk right because a lot of these plugin

00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,190
developers are not being you know

00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,050
they're freely putting their efforts

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,700
into the community put this code out

00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,370
there and then oh my gosh I have to feed

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,250
my family I can't support this there's a

00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,140
lot of Lovings like that there are

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,850
55,000 plugins in the repository a lot

00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,060
of them that are doing basically the

00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:20,580
same thing but you know there may be

00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,110
like a niche type of activity that's

00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,570
really integral to your business

00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:25,019
interval to what you're trying to

00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,890
community

00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:30,809
for your customers and I would go

00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,929
through those steps I would plug it into

00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:35,549
Cobra the code risk site and see what

00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,289
kind of score and against everything

00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:38,759
that's in the repositories in there so

00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:41,609
that that Kota scores kind of

00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:43,709
interesting I know WordPress has there's

00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:45,749
a project called tide that's kind of in

00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:48,479
flux right now but they're doing code

00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:50,279
analysis on the repository as things I

00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:54,149
want for that project and see what's

00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:57,569
happening there but I would look for I'd

00:49:54,149 --> 00:49:59,309
look for for support I'd look for the

00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:01,380
version number when WordPress has been

00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:03,539
around 15 years so whether that's

00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,419
weren't right and true has been around

00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:10,769
for a while and it has a low score in

00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:12,419
terms of the code risk and you know it's

00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:13,890
everything that you have on your site

00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:16,519
you're you're basically taking a risk

00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:20,899
but you're taking a calculated risk and

00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:23,609
also just you know backup cert minute

00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:26,099
because you know you never know when a

00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,079
vulnerability is but the people 100,000

00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,349
people who had the GDP our compliance

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,419
plug-in on their site that was probably

00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:34,889
having owner ability this week they have

00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:37,889
that under say because they believe

00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:39,599
fully and they are you know trying to

00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:42,149
take care of their customers and adhere

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,159
to gdpr compliance issues right they're

00:50:42,149 --> 00:50:45,880
trying to do the right thing they don't

00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,030
realize that it's an owner

00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,270
until somebody discovers it and once

00:50:49,030 --> 00:51:14,560
that vulnerability is found updates

00:50:52,270 --> 00:51:17,440
oh sure sure you can take a pull any cut

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,870
plug-in and basically fork it and create

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,290
your own version of that button and

00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:29,410
modify it nice to do that too or don't

00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:30,730
tell anyone don't do that because then

00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,800
you you know you're going to update

00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,770
things and then you're you've work

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,740
something and now it's yours right

00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:40,960
anything changes WordPress five comes

00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:45,210
along and it's not compatible anymore

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,860
guess whose responsibility that is yours

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,240
so the repositories will be the best of

00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,520
both worlds right because we've got

00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,220
people who are actively watching it or

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,820
actively maintaining it and the

00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,290
community that's watching this was fun

00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,770
you guys I really appreciate you coming

00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,770
