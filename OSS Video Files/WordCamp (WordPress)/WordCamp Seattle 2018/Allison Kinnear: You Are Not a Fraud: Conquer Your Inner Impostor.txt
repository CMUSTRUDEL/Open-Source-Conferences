things related to my website and my

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,209

taking this time to come here today

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,619
because we're

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,140
to be kind of diving deep into imposter

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,770
syndrome what it is how it shows up in

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,570
our lives and what we can do about it

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,270
but first if I can just check like how

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,810
many of you are bloggers or content

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:55,250
creators by reason he had wonderful how

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:58,729
many are developers beautiful and how

00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:07,459
many are like non-technical supporters

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:16,549
of perfect is me I don't think my notes

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:19,760
are way over here over here so my

00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:22,310
journey with impostor syndrome started a

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,709
long time ago I want to come and tell

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,769
you about that and then we'll dive into

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:33,890
what impostor syndrome looks like in

00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:37,040
2007 I was hired at Google in there

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,530
people lost apartment and when I got the

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,480
job I had this having a conversation

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,400
with someone and she said well he must

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,430
be really good at what you do you know

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,560
hiring people and I said yeah if if they

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,140
really knew this was someone close to me

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,140
I was like I just feel like it's a

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,299
little from this is long before I even

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,370
knew there was a term to describe this

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,609
and she so he mean a fraud I said I just

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,660
I feel like a total fraud like if they

00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:09,520
only knew I'm just really good at

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,020
like convincing people that I know what

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm doing

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,170
and apparently I've hoodwinked everyone

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,270
and I'm hooked with my imposter syndrome

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:25,230
by doing all the things that that a good

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:29,380
imposter does I was perfectionistic I

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,720
worked extremely long hours I beat

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,830
myself up over every little mistake I

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,590
made and that worked for a bimini help

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:47,200
me excel and help me do great things but

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:49,240
it also was exhausting and when I was I

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,480
started off by Google as an individual

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,640
contributor and then within a year of

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,680
promoted to a people manager running a

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,720
team of 16 people and at that point

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,630
that's when the wheels really came off

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,100
of us because I could no longer really

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:12,250
be the perfectionist that I wanted to be

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,310
in my inner people pleaser that I had

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,140
was really in confidence because when

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,470
you're managing a team of 16 people you

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:24,360
can't really please everyone by working

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,640
hard and long hours really escalated and

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,220
I started getting feedback from people

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,350
that was from my directory reports that

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,510
were saying things like

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,160
my furniture which really upset my

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,230
people please our site it was like we

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,400
need company my current manager and the

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:45,480
people's lessor this is so confusing and

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:50,400
then in 2010 two important things

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,930
happened one I became pregnant for the

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,640
first time with my daughter

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:59,520
and - I got a new manager who was the

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,990
physical embodiment of every negative

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,190
thought I had ever had about myself she

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,980
would come in and say things to me like

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,690
you're not pushing it hard enough and

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,050
she would say things like you just need

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,320
to work harder and longer hours even

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,500
quicker and she would say things like I

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,550
don't think you're you're I don't think

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,920
this is the right job for you

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:31,770
and so my confidence went from being

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,400
kind of on shaky ground to completely

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:39,000
plumbing and the probably of my work

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,210
went straight down as well and I

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,680
remember things got so bad they got to

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,440
the point where I actually asked for a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,020
demotion I asked to go back to my

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,320
individual contributor role and what

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,950
that would be what that would mean and

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:59,860
when the when the word came out and

00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:02,389
actually this

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,770
Google all these people really seem to

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,009
have it together and I still have no

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,009
idea

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,539
but when the word came back with what my

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:17,180
salary would be I realized there was no

00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:18,740
way that a family of three my husband

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,830
already quit his job to take care of our

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,789
our daughter the kids survive in Silicon

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,319
Valley what that's how it was

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,599
and I remember hitting the news I was in

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,939
my car was the only pride that place I

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:36,080
could find and I just remember sobbing

00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:38,509
and taking a moment to just breathe and

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,689
feel all the feelings that came you know

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,750
the sadness the helplessness the rage

00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:47,180
and when it came down to it after I kept

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,189
breathing it was just like theater and I

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,139
was like oh oh I'm afraid it's like all

00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:56,389
those intense feelings just gave waited

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,330
just being afraid I was like I hope you

00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:02,389
pay like it's just here and I remember

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,710
just like kind of laughing and realizing

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:10,039
I have a decision to make

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:12,969
I could either stay in my position as

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:18,710
people manager and try to figure it out

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:22,039
or I could leave and do I don't know

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,509
what because at that point I felt like I

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,900
hadn't never worked it and feel like I

00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:30,229
was good at anything anymore

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,860
so I decide to stay I was like I'm not a

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,419
quitter

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,940
we are gonna figure this out I don't

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,240
figure this out and so I leaned on my

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,520
professional support and I began to

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,610
entertain the ideas like couch for 35

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,740
years I always thought I was a fraud and

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,660
now everything I've you did my a lot of

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,500
my viewed through the lens of I am a

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,320
fraud but hitting that rock bottom

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,740
helped me contemplate a different

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:02,750
question which is what if I'm not a

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,380
fraud what if all the things that people

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:10,490
who know me love me in and see me

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:13,160
they're saying to yourself up like what

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,360
if I start to believe that even a little

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,640
bit just as claimant and so little by

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,920
little that's what I started to do and

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,940
every time I would take this little baby

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,330
step towards what I'm not a fraud it's

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,520
suddenly like things started opening up

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,870
and kind of magical things started

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,810
happening each time to that stop and in

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,910
things really got interesting because at

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,150
one point I had a big meeting there

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,640
about 40 people and I was co-presenting

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,130
with my colleague Janice and Janice was

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,360
just amazing she had written books she

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,220
was somebody

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,400
everybody loved and respected she was

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,110
just like she she's so articulate I

00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,760
always grew up my parents that my

00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,910
brother is saying like oh you just speak

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,460
your own language

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,020
like it's hard to follow you so I was

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,450
always self-conscious about the way I

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,790
had came across to people but Janice was

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,160
so articulate and amazing and I remember

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,360
going into this meeting with her and

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,820
every time I go into these meetings

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,950
before us we hope we send it a lot I

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,290
would be thinking of myself while I'm

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,730
talking was what would you miss main

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,250
question is thinking what is Janice

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,570
thinking what should she think I hope I

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,170
can be like Janice I don't think any

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,050
margins

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,010
that's usually what happens and so that

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,560
day I was getting into that headspace

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,000
but something inside me maybe because I

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,430
had been kind of taking these little

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,360
baby steps out of you are fraud and into

00:09:38,430 --> 00:10:01,950
maybe I'm not something reared up in me

00:09:42,360 --> 00:10:04,470
but just had to and some of the

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,290
consequences later you say what you need

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,740
the same and suffer the consequences

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:13,500
later so I did I stepped into that

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,820
meeting and instead of my questions

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,470
thinking when she was thinking I was

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,620
just like now Janice I'm just

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,900
Mississippi and so I did and I got some

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,440
pretty hard questions from the group

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,870
afterwards and then answered them and I

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,010
was able to like keep it keep together

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,710
and then of course the meeting ends and

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,040
Janice is across the room when she walks

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,620
up and she just beelined it to me and

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,330
inside I am like oh

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,250
[Music]

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,080
and at this point we had been working

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,390
together for like five years and she

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,850
came out to me and said I just want to

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,850
tell you I have never heard you talk

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,070
like that before and it was amazing

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,480
that was beautiful I've never heard you

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,400
talk about your work I've heard you talk

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,410
I work a lot of times but never when she

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,360
talked about it quite in that way you've

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:10,430
got a lot of really hard questions and

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,990
you answer them beautifully and then she

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:18,890
walks away and I'm just sat there with

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:21,440
okay and it turns out two years later

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,830
after I've been a recovering impostor I

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,810
learned there was a man for all of this

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,840
y'all knew the name before you even want

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,900
to it right impostor syndrome so let's

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:38,090
talk Oh first I want to tell you

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:41,270
something oh and I need to say

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,640
once I started trusting myself such as

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,220
is the first feet secret of success once

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,980
I started trusting myself that is when

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,790
the promotion started happening again

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,290
that's when the the recognition started

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,750
coming that's when I will tell you my

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:02,060
team did the best work ever happen after

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,100
I started taking those steps the quality

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,950
of my work was good before but it went

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,840
so much higher once I was able to kind

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,800
of just take those baby steps into what

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,820
if I'm not a fraud and this is the key

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,830
trusting in yourself trusting in

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,590
resiliency it's interesting and yells

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,540
air and I was just talking to him last

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:24,230
night and we had this great conversation

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:29,390
about fear and one of the things that he

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,430
said is that he uses fear as not

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,980
necessarily something to stop that's not

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,260
a stop it with something that harness to

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,130
propel yourself forward because when

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,960
you're afraid of something

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,790
who knows what's on the other side it

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,930
can be your passion it could be a

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,660
positive step in a new a new habit a new

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:51,110
way of life so we can harness our fears

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,260
and propel us forward or we can get

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,140
stopped and shut ourselves down and my

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,970
hope for you is that you're able to make

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,450
like a one degree shift

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:07,330
just a one degree shift to help you go

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:11,300
from heading towards you know

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,770
self-critic Island to heading towards

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,050
the country of confidence because

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,840
there's so much great things around

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:21,530
confidence and if we can make that one

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,900
degree shift then and sustain it over

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:29,810
time it can really take you to a great

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:31,730
place oh and because it's 4:30 in the

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,400
afternoon I made a little tired around

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,960
overload yeah okay so it makes me need

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,410
two things I like to tell people when

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm speaking what is and this is great

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,740
for anyone who is really critical for

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,770
themselves I have a mentor

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,900
said instead of saying you know it's

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,270
really easy to say things like so you're

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,180
making steak and god I'm so stupid right

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,870
anybody say that to themselves I'm so

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,540
stupid

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,940
yeah so it's devastating that is like

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:08,340
what if you change that just say I'm so

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:11,070
sexy maybe oh I'm so sexy right it's

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,630
it's silly it's silly a new command and

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,290
hot chicks are I'm going to be sexy

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,540
today

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,110
so if I have you feel free to tell me

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,630
I'm looking at that the second thing

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,950
that I love to increase especially when

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,030
energy is starting to the tush want is

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,100
sometimes I'm just like for people to

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,440
give you general highfive a little like

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,450
at our physical bodies engaged and I

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,280
might ask you to do that so actually I'm

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,630
gonna ask you right now I want you to

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,280
turn to someone give them a high five

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,280
and say I'm so sexy

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,320
maybe just use that as much as you wanna

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,880
so let's talk about sexiness and let's

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,940
talk about a conscious now I'm gonna put

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:07,250
down things I like I like this a lot

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:10,910
so impostor syndrome well the thing

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,880
about impostor syndrome is that impostor

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,940
syndrome of impacts or a sexy rare

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,950
ability of to place that works like an

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,590
impostor syndrome affects high achieving

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,940
people it affects people who are highly

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,090
skilled but have a low of a perception

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,010
of themselves that they are actually

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,140
lolis right like that's their perception

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,380
so you actually maybe that's why it

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,230
affects people in tech it affects people

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,380
professors in universities it affects

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,320
people who are really crying cheating

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,850
but inside they feel like they're going

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,300
to be found out as a fraud they think

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,700
it's just luck oh I just just really

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,830
nice and people like me this was all

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,960
just a fluke it was just you know it

00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,790
just kind of happened that I got this

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:05,720
amazing job there are people who are at

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,970
upper levels in executive teams and

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,220
large companies who are thinking I'm

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,860
just here because it's a flute when you

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,920
ask well does your team just hire nice

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,330
people and you're like no no they're

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,990
really rigorous like okay

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:27,130
so we had a high ability right we have a

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,740
high ability so our actual ability is

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:34,230
quite hot but our perceived ability our

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:39,040
perception of our ability is quite low

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,560
this is different then the oh gosh

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,089
dunning-kruger effect anybody original

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,670
timing originally had a few rhythms I

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:48,370
think America Democrats is the opposite

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,459
dunning-kruger effect is when your

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,709
actual ability is quite below but your

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,329
perception of variability is hot so I

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:58,899
think about this like what you know

00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:00,070
American Idol the things you like you

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:02,380
know are you going to be the next

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,420
American Idol oh yes I am and they're

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,220
all pumped up and then they step up and

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:11,290
they're like wow this is somebody with a

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,230
low ability but their perception of

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,540
themselves is quite escalated and the

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,670
biggest fear for most Impostors is that

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,410
they aren't really afraid to be the

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,540
dummy falling into that dunning-kruger

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,370
effect and so they do everything

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,480
possible keeps their perception of

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:31,630
themselves laughs well so dunning-kruger

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,140
effect a wise man never knows all fools

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,290
know everything and impostor syndrome

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,880
Mike Myers Hugh and he did Austin Powers

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,760
Wayne's World

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,770
writer-director comedian at any time I

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,400
still expect that no-talent police will

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,169
come and arrest me that's what that's

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,410
what impostor syndrome sounds like it

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:57,190
sounds like somebody's gonna come at any

00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:00,220
point and take this away from me because

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,800
it was all luck anyway and an

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,880
interesting thing is oh and calm down

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,530
come on more sexy so here's the thing

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,470
what we want to do is we want to bring

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:14,980
this blue line up to this kind of

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,980
so that our perception of our abilities

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,350
matches our actual abilities and not

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,870
only that there's a great book called

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,880
the confidence code when they talk about

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,520
how your confidence is more important

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,340
than your IQ it's more important than

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,160
your actual ability and what they find

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:38,450
is that successful people actually have

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:43,600
a slight tilt just a slight tilt toward

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,600
a believer countenance so in reality

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,770
you're here your high achiever you want

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,340
to be not here you want to be just

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:55,030
slightly above that line and for many

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,810
well this isn't I mean this is a stretch

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:03,530
it's a leap to go that high especially

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:07,460
when you're used to being down here this

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:10,670
is a perception problem not a

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,620
performance problem that's what I'm

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,000
toast your syndrome is it's not about

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,650
your performance it's about your

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,650
perception around your performance

00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:32,999
one other thing and so what happens is

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:34,679
when our confidence is so low again like

00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:37,849
in another way with this is this is a

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:43,499
confidence as you want competence issue

00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:45,269
right your competence can be super high

00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,309
that your confidence in yourself can be

00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:52,109
so low and that impacts us in so many

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:54,149
ways for example if if there's a job

00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:57,179
that you are interested in kind of an

00:19:54,149 --> 00:20:00,330
excelling to for most women they will

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,659
wait until they meet 100% of the

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:07,320
criteria before they apply to that job

00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:11,549
for men to leave not all but men

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,409
typically sixty percent so that means we

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,359
need people are when they have higher

00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,789
confidence they put themselves up for

00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,649
function sooner they put themselves out

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,509
there sitting there they're gonna hate

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:26,099
to make a mistake fail in front of a

00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:28,289
group for others that's like the worst

00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:31,979
thing imaginable so they don't put

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:36,269
themselves out there and by the way just

00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:38,549
for the the data of people here seventy

00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:42,149
percent of the u.s. population is

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:46,080
affected by a master Schneider and it

00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:47,849
impacts women people of color immigrants

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,289
people who grew up in much lower

00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:56,009
socioeconomic status LGBTQ because it's

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:58,859
really easy to confuse the messages that

00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:03,950
society gives us about their perception

00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:06,899
of our abilities and that feeds into our

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,429
that that can feed into our own

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,129
perception of ourselves

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,970
it also has people who work from home

00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,860
and impacts people

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,180
finding creative fields where there's a

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,550
lot of learning that needs to happen

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,530
that's why it affects tech so much

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,180
there's a lot of unknowns there's a lot

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,140
of risks that need to be taken there's a

00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,000
lot of creating that needs to happen

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:32,020
okay

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,060
so you know what let's take it let's

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,220
take a high five this is a perception

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,320
problem not a performance problem

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,580
high five someone to tell them that this

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,580
is a perception

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,720
let's do this so now what do we do what

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,970
do we do what do we do about this so one

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,890
of the first things that we can do is to

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:07,630
recognize your inner critic and what I

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,900
love doing for people because I'm

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,440
telling you it is so powerful

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,429
give your scurrying and clinic a name

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,740
you know when I sat there in that

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:20,590
meeting I was able to find the Donnell

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,720
in which I was able to turn down in my

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,940
 Janus moment I was able to turn

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,590
down the volume on my inner critic and

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,660
turn up the volume on my inner contender

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,750
my inner container in the inner

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,700
container i defined as that part of you

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,780
that you know like if they were not

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,590
afraid what would they do

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,170
so part of me that just wants to go for

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,730
it wants to say what needs to be said

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,650
wants to put out the hunt any one of

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,750
them out there what would you do if you

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:54,280
knew you couldn't fail that chair dinner

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,860
contender right so it's helpful to name

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,650
your entertainment critic or hearing a

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,710
and your energy and Heather so for

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,510
example when things I - is making

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,860
consultations with people I gave a talk

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:11,200
at Amazon and a couple of months ago

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,620
over 600 people ended up attending the

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,780
talk and

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,280
one of I was having these consultations

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,690
with a lot of people in there was this

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:27,380
one guy who was at a top level executive

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:29,330
team immigrant and he came from he went

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,270
to a university that wasn't as

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,820
prestigious as his colleagues and he

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,400
said I'm so afraid of losing my seat at

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,740
the table I'm so afraid that I'm gonna

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,420
I'm gonna get you know they're gonna

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,190
find me now I think they just hired and

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,860
I think they just brought me I feel like

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,730
to me so we were able to her might work

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,740
that that out and I said you know what's

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:55,480
what's the name of your inner commander

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:59,059
her inner container and he's like sesame

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,040
he's like that's the commander and I was

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:03,260
like cool all right

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,460
here's what I wanted to do I want you to

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,000
notice Swagger's

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,250
song list that helps you bring out your

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,480
inner contender so before you go into

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,960
those meetings that make you a little

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,210
nervous

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,040
you've got your swagger solomon that

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,330
you're listening to in the car so the

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,550
commander can show up because the

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,179
commander you already have a seat at

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,429
this table

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:26,270
you wanted this seat at the table you

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:28,190
have it don't lose it because when you

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,559
show when you continue to show and

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,800
you're kind of like still trying to be

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:38,080
scrappy and prove that you earned your

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:41,500
seat people see that and I

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,390
no I mean but when you're in a container

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,940
can show up where your inner commandant

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,539
can show up then it can make a

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,750
difference

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:52,120
I checked it within six weeks later he's

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,740
like aha how's that

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,470
I can't even tell you I'm feeling so

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,320
much better into a great work I have I

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,120
am like old weightless and I listen to

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,470
you and I don't really need it all the

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,200
time but there were some days that I do

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,370
and it's helping so much I'm feeling so

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,409
much better than without being on this

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,720
team so cool I have another person same

00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,990
things that a consultation with her she

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,049
hurries was called the cheerleader she's

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,149
a lawyer and she often times was the

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,309
only woman in the room and so people

00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:28,750
would come in and ask her to take notice

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:31,779
and instead of imploding like most

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:35,830
people do she would explode towards the

00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:38,470
others and get really you know kind of

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,630
blast other people and she recognized it

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,260
was a problem she'd kind of hard time

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,360
trying to fix it but again it was that

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,929
scrappy upbringing she came from a lower

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,899
socioeconomic class and didn't go to as

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,419
prestigious of the school and so she was

00:25:52,899 --> 00:26:00,399
still like that kid fighting for her

00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:02,679
worth on the streets and she was able to

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:06,340
the cheerleader held turkey leg you know

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:09,029
what you're okay okay you don't need a

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,230
blouse those people they're good

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,510
everybody the people who know you see

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,320
that and I check them with her six weeks

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,210
later she's like it's really helping me

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,700
maybe your inner critic and gaming

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,830
you're in a contender can be tools to

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,950
help you be able to find those volume

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,519
tiles my inner critic I call the wagging

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,730
finger it is just like you should know

00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,980
better here

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:38,570
you're not kind of nothing's like just a

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:45,350
giant wagging finger other people grew

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:47,929
eligibile so that's that let's do this

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:52,190
we've got to become a little do we have

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:54,320
time we do let's take 30 seconds right

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,630
now what's the name of your inner critic

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,200
all sometimes the first thing that comes

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:03,639
to mind right on your inner critic might

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,639
have your inner contender

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:44,950
and anybody got one that they feel brave

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:46,840
enough I love it I love it doesn't great

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,369
inner critic I can just see a monk kind

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,059
of wiring yeah

00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:55,059
strung out that's awesome thank you

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,399
one other thing I like to do again in my

00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,200
workshops let's get let's get this guy a

00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,629
woosh from your heart it's just like a

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,830
thank you it's like a positive energy

00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:11,279
ready one two three

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:11,279
a little Louie Rivas anybody else

00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:27,960
internal Asian mom Oh fantastic

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,419
yeah high standards highly critical

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,129
uh-huh yeah excellent let's get let's

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,129
give a little whoosh there one two three

00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:41,499
so the point is not to kill the critic

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,880
the other critics there you can help

00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:47,370
keep you safe emotional

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:50,080
mentally sane physically safe sometimes

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,810
but the point is to turn down the body

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,330
because he in critical eyes the inner

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,850
commit can crowd out every positive

00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,350
thing about yourself the inner critic

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,750
can make you believe that you have

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,770
nothing of value and that's how we

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,330
anybody have an inner contender see

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:28,990
sometimes it's easier to me my inner

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:29,290
critic than our inner contender that's

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,820
right

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,370
and sometimes it could be that it can be

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:38,260
somebody we know someone that helps us

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:43,450
remember our value in our work thank you

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:45,910
all right so because their inner critic

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,000
can wreak havoc on us because our inner

00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:53,110
critic and my crown know all the things

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,450
that we're good at we have to do what we

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:59,440
can to remember that our positive

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:03,370
qualities so anybody ever received a

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,200
performance review and they scroll all

00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,780
the positive comments and then just go

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,210
right to the areas of developing case we

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:15,400
have a few come back or you get comments

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:17,590
on your blog and then like one person

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,830
says something negative and like that's

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,690
the only thing you see they just like

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,950
hang or focus on that one negative

00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:29,110
review and kind of disregard the rest

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,140
it's really easy for us to do that and

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:35,350
the problem becomes that when we have

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,650
hyper focus on the negative and we kind

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:41,590
of crowd out all the things that we

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:46,090
aren't it and it keeps that perception

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:48,790
of ourselves really low I used to when I

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,680
would give talks I would look at I would

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,860
give toss to it real and I would see you

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,720
know 50 people like leaning in and I

00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:59,230
would see one person coming checked out

00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:06,820
and I would speak only to that person I

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:10,720
would be like I'm gonna turn you love me

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:13,090
man and it's like it never really holds

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,620
I was like ignoring all the other people

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:20,230
that were like smiling and nodding along

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:22,380
and now I've learned that I don't need

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,750
to pay attention to protect a person I

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,390
need to lean it into the people that are

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,240
actually with me the people that are

00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,520
actually hanging on with me we need to

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,020
lean into those positive comments

00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:42,100
because there's not just to inflate our

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,800
ego but to help remind us why we're here

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,110
doing this work in the first place

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,890
tell remind us of our work to not let

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,470
our main critic

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,450
have it so what think I actually

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:58,100
encourage people to do sometimes is to

00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:03,020
make a brag list try to one day brag

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:07,160
about yourself like unfiltered bragging

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:10,160
and the coolest thing that you have ever

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,010
done in your entire life I can make my

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,740
tongue into a taco you know like you

00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,720
could get the most miniscule thing I

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,049
really couldn't find any chemicals

00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,750
sounds or I am an amazing writer or I

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:27,919
have an amazing coder or I am amazing

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:32,299
whatever we sometimes need to remind

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:35,299
ourselves of that because it helps us be

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:37,610
able to see all of ourselves and not

00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,250
lose track of ourselves and it also

00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:43,610
helps propel us for those times when we

00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,770
are afraid and we think I can't put this

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:51,040
out there I can't have that hard

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,040
conversation it helps

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:09,630
so this is just one of those interesting

00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,270
things in life where our comfort zone is

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,010
here and the magic happens over outside

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:18,330
of our comfort zone we all kind of know

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:21,810
that's right and for those of you who

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:26,310
are bloggers or who are creating content

00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:28,650
or have created your own business we

00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:32,130
have a lot of practice and being outside

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:36,390
our comfort zone yes like we practice

00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:39,210
that on a daily basis and one of the

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:42,660
things that you know I heard a talk

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,700
earlier Michelle she received a question

00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,820
from audience where somebody said what

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,220
would you if you were to go back in time

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,490
to when you first started being a

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,010
blogger when what do you wish you'd

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,440
inventing in there now and she said I

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:04,350
wish I wasn't afraid I wish I wasn't

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,970
afraid to ask for help this is when we

00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,590
are afraid that our inner critic is

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,900
running amuck when we are not reaching

00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,200
out our inner critic is usually running

00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:16,500
amuck so we have to get around the

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,280
pattern we have to interrupt that inner

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,940
critic and say oh I hear you I hear you

00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,340
Steve

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,530
I need Kevin to come in now I hear you

00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:32,510
[Music]

00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:36,840
internal Asian mom and now I need

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:40,500
whoever to come back I need so much like

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,750
I hear the fader I hear in and usually

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,140
fear that enmity experiences where your

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,600
fear that in your

00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,210
afraid of once you actually do it it

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,480
leads you to that next level that you've

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,230
been dying to get to in the first place

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,990
raise your hand if you've had that

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,430
happen the thing you're most afraid of

00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,530
then suddenly you do it and then

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,530
suddenly is like oh my gosh this is what

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,990
I've been wanting all along our fear is

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,250
not necessarily something that should

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,290
stop us in our track

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,200
it's kind of an indication that there's

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:13,330
some gold on the other side there's this

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,690
great quote from Joseph Campbell it says

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:20,410
the cave you fear to enter holds the

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:22,390
treasure that you seek the cave you fear

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,990
to enter holds the Treasury than you

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:28,260
seek that fear is just a feeling of like

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,470
you're about to change

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,780
you're about to grow in a big way you're

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,090
about to take that extended and go to

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:41,110
that next level that's why my best work

00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,730
happened after you know what I mean it's

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,800
like after I was like oh I'm just afraid

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,520
okay I can work through fear let's move

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,730
through this fear let's step into but

00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,930
step into all the things I am for that

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,290
let's feel the fear and let's do it

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,050
anyway

00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,520
and this isn't about faking it if some

00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,500
people say I don't think until you make

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,050
it and that's that's true to a certain

00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,290
extent I'm going to make fan of faking

00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:09,430
things I prefer to be just that just

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:11,800
mean the what faking it tez is faking it

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,890
gives you that little loans to like take

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:20,170
the risk to be a little bit more bold to

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:22,450
take that next step and so we have to we

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:26,010
have to interrupt our fear patterns to

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,010
help us take those next steps

00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:47,640
so so I've created a guide for people if

00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,650
you want more informations cut an

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,520
impostor syndrome Survival Guide because

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,560
I see what happens I see how people will

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,300
work themselves to the bone especially

00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,660
the small business owners and

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,210
entrepreneurs where you're just working

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,580
all the time it's like a working smarter

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,109
not harder kind of thing impostor

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,460
senator will make you work harder all

00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,619
the time and it will stop you from

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,170
working smarter it'll stop you from

00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,690
taking care of yourself so that you can

00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,270
do the great work impostor syndrome I

00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,760
see how much it stops people in their

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:25,920
fears from actually growing their

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,480
business from making the calls or you

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,950
know writing the content that they

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,330
really want to write but then they are

00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:34,619
worried about what other people will

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:36,180
think those kinds of things I see that I

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,180
see I have a front row seat of that

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,900
because of my clients are most of

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,180
entrepreneurs business owners or

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:49,920
executives and I see them stopping

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:52,800
themselves a lot but I also see what

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,780
happens when they break through and I

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,510
also see them grow their businesses a

00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:01,320
lot more I see them getting more clients

00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,360
I see them having the hard conversations

00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,680
and then suddenly

00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,550
anything changes for the better because

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,460
they did and so if anyone is interested

00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:13,000
in that I actually have one other thing

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,070
after you if you if you do the guide

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,450
there's an opportunity for a

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,340
consultation with me and you can do it

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,700
for free if you just type ordered into

00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,710
the consultation thing so that I just

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,920
want to offer that to you because it's

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,830
important to me I see all of the people

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,690
in work camp as being really doing

00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:36,670
things to change the world in for a

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:40,220
better place and to me that's just

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:44,900
because I know things happen people are

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:48,190
stepping into their integrity so so

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,190
that's my offer

00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:54,050
that being said my hope for all of you

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,690
is that you make of whatever shift you

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,490
can to interrupt the inner critic in you

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,800
instead of help you step into the inner

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:06,290
contender you don't have to be exhausted

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,260
flattened people that you can do amazing

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:11,420
work and also take care of yourself you

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,090
can do amazing work and dance with

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,700
people's concerns and reflections of you

00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,890
and my hope is that is thank you to do

00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,110
that if you take whatever steps we need

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:26,060
to take so that it can show up in the

00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:29,200
world in a big way that's what I have in

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,200
terms of content

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,340
[Applause]

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,590
[Music]

00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:02,750
yeah that's great question so can you

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,660
feel confident in other area like that

00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:10,820
then summer program hustler syndrome

00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:12,740
it's it's interesting yes and no I think

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,720
for many people impostor syndrome is

00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,480
kind of pervasive I know for me it was

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,310
like I felt like a fraud with my husband

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,680
who I was about to marry I felt like

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,510
fraud and applying to googling it kind

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,070
of was like

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,260
anyone really knew what was going on

00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,150
inside this head they would not love me

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,460
like that was that was like kind of one

00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,550
end of the spectrum right I think

00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,190
there's also sometimes imposters the

00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:38,700
nerve just kind of flares up so like if

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:42,010
you're if you're in a new job or you're

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,810
taking if you're doing a whole new

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,060
project that you don't you're in the

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:50,080
learning process there's a really great

00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:51,310
book called on the secrets of highly

00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,370
successful women

00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,410
Valerie young as she talks about seven

00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:59,200
good reasons why you would feel like an

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,150
imposter and one of them is you're

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,510
learning something new a lot of college

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:07,030
students feel it it can also happen if

00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:09,640
if the workplace environment is not

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,290
conducive there are certain workplace

00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,240
environments where they're like I want

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,390
you to achieve great things but have a

00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,150
really low risk like taker implements

00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:22,480
that is like that is just a pressure

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:26,140
cooker of imposter syndrome like it's a

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:30,000
breeding grounds for that so I think you

00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:32,530
can it can happen and part of it is to

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,200
kind of tease out why why is it

00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,850
happening in this particular area is it

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,620
because I'm learning new things is it

00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,110
because I'm having to show up in a

00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,390
bigger way is it because I'm having to

00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:46,030
have more difficult conversations is it

00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:48,140
because of the environment is it because

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,850
I'm the only woman in the room

00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,460
for some color in the room and only

00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:55,550
whatever in the room like sometimes

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,970
those are factors that can feed into it

00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,970
as well

00:42:23,790 --> 00:43:17,710
so I was like you know I actually do

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:25,270
know something and anyways group unless

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:29,010
sorry here's the finally you know decide

00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,010
that I did know something that was worth

00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,659
[Applause]

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:41,540
and that is where to me that's what rag

00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,400
les comes in and the BRABUS doesn't have

00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,090
to be necessarily if I'm amazing but

00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,650
it's like what do I know what do I

00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,360
because I'm not saying I'm working my

00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,610
butt off I'm a senator money bomb box

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,610
not doing anything right like I do know

00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,510
things very very everyone in this room

00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:02,540
knows things sometimes we need to remind

00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:06,410
ourselves of that because if you do have

00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:08,120
a goal of presenting and you can you can

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,530
find those things that you do they want

00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,630
to talk about instead of on

00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,890
yourself you know like winner well you

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:19,180
should know this or you should know that

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:19,180
it was helpful when we show ourselves

00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:40,020
for me is when it comes to voices I feel

00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,720
completely confident in my skills and

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,430
knowledge when I'm doing the work and I

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,350
know my clients loving it and then it

00:44:44,430 --> 00:45:00,420
comes time to like send them a bill and

00:44:46,350 --> 00:45:02,670
there's this boy Steve says yeah there's

00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:06,420
a lot that can be done around working

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:09,240
with our relationship with money because

00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:13,500
it definitely it definitely can show up

00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,540
in those in that arena because money has

00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,070
a lot of meanings and a lot of

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,760
attachments for us in our relationship

00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:25,490
with money it really impacts the way we

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:29,940
ask for money and the way we value a

00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:33,090
monetary value on ourselves and so it's

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:37,080
worth I know for me things that have

00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:39,210
been helpful is really just reflecting

00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,370
on what what does money mean what were

00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,560
the messages that I received as a kid

00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,300
growing up around money what are the

00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,620
things that I tell myself about money

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,870
how do i you know is money like there's

00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:57,930
not enough and there's never enough or

00:45:51,870 --> 00:46:00,660
is money something that is you only get

00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,190
if you're good enough or is money you

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,150
know that there's that there's a lot of

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:08,780
stories that we can

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:11,540
that notes that that's a good talk for a

00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:33,130
future thing because I think it flares

00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:36,770
up a lot for people and I think there's

00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:40,850
sometimes we need sounding boards in our

00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:43,520
lives other people to say no you

00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,990
shouldn't write you this much and for us

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,750
to kind of like interrupts that pattern

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,760
and just only like something the

00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:54,440
consequences I'm just gonna put this in

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:56,090
voice now and I will I will some the

00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:14,270
consequences whatever comes my way is

00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:17,120
reasons what's really exciting is to see

00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,190
young people younger people that I am

00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,580
you learn about this stuff early in life

00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:26,440
because it's the type of stuff for many

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:30,110
of us in my generation and older that

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,700
you know we and I'm my first profession

00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,720
of civil engineering so I've been around

00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,780
in a man's world for much of my life and

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:43,010
you know if it's so nice to have a need

00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:45,710
to put on this and I am getting rid of

00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:48,730
my my inner critic is my mother and it's

00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,730
like my real mother

00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:58,009
but to write that down and then cross it

00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:03,079
out and they go well maybe it really is

00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:06,170
so I just used for me March but but it's

00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:08,720
just that it's just to realize two

00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,759
people put in me money but it's kind of

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,589
sad that it's also my mother and I'm

00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:13,069
glad I didn't raise my kids that way at

00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,329
all

00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:18,890
yeah but still it's just it's kind of it

00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:21,519
it's so it's very exciting to hear

00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,809
something from the next generation that

00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:28,460
it's going to make things better for

00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:30,049
everyone thank you yeah I I agree I

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,549
didn't know like I said I didn't know

00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:33,349
about impostor syndrome until two years

00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:36,200
I was like two years out of the woods

00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:37,339
and I went to a workshop a cutable and

00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,019
they were like we're gonna talk about

00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:42,829
imposter syndrome like are you kidding

00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:44,240
me I finally got myself out of this it

00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:48,410
would have been nice to know there was

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,990
like if you mean so yeah it is helpful

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,210
and there's a great book that secrets to

00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:55,190
successful women is I can't even

00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,470
emphasize that enough by Valerie young

00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:00,230
and so the fantastic book and a great

00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,180
resource or it's a I know it's about

00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,079
women and

00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:12,369
like I said been suffer from it too but

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:16,079
it's it's it's really eye-opening I just

00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,079
