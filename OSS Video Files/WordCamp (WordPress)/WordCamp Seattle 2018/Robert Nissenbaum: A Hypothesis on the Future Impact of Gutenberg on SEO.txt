welcome back from lunch you are about to

00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,170
hear a raucous Nissenbaum

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,050
Robert involved a content creation for

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,219
the web for close to 20 years his views

00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,980
on content marketing and search engine

00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:19,720
optimization are against the nature

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,180
including his belief the keyword

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,710
research is mostly unnecessary he's

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,140
right over the past several years he's

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,349
been testing his ideas on SEO and what

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,300
it takes to rank by looking at the goal

00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:36,940
behind Google's algorithm and how we

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,769
search consume content he's not behind a

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,780
computer screen you'll find pushing

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:49,929
these limits as an evidence hacker

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:52,089
please join me so the first piece of

00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,940
this is I am NOT a developer in the

00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:57,280
slightest sense as far as I'm concerned

00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,499
you can burgers really all the arguments

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,299
happening without it really don't impact

00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:04,420
me as opposed to whether they're just if

00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,619
they be functional or not what I've been

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,969
trying to figure out which I haven't

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,799
been able to come up with a really

00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:11,320
answer that actually sits well with me

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,780
and it goes to my understanding of

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,579
everything and how we move forward with

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,799
content and search engine optimization

00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:20,380
if Y we have pinky burger the first cuts

00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,469
and most of those arguments tend to

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,299
center around Wix Weebly Squarespace and

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:28,929
be easier for the average person to be

00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,240
able to create web content on one level

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:34,149
I get it on the other level I don't and

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,689
primarily because we have more than

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:39,880
enough capable systems now there are

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,829
more than a plugin to give us the

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,960
ability to admit it to the contact the

00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,630
way we want it to do but with fever

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,640
builder Elementor simple enough I think

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,270
quite honestly in my opinion people seem

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,499
to make sense can be easy enough to

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,429
create something like that as a new

00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:58,979
editor if that's all we were after and

00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,240
make it part of WordPress as it is

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,749
without tearing everything down to the

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,579
core

00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:06,460
creating all of these potential

00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,080
accessibility issues breaking backwards

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,360
compatibility in a host of different

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,170
ways and creating all kinds of other

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,750
problems

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:19,730
and while many of them last week at

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,510
closing remarks for work in Portland was

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,700
talking about the new Gutenberg editor

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,519
for me it goes much beyond that again

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,260
other than break the system he stated

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,830
very clearly that we pushed off other

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,540
projects for beauty birth this has been

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,510
happening over a long period of time

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,890
there are bigger issues in my mind when

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,010
it comes to WordPress and the big one

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,660
being security what makes sense to

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,670
address that before we worry about an

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,769
editing system that takes up a whole of

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,290
everything else there's the potential

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,959
now for updates be pushed every two

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,090
weeks to the court once we release five

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,160
up and this is coming from Matt himself

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,670
last week don't you get the odd explain

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,549
yourself right so I said that I'm trying

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:09,470
to figure out after all this reading why

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:12,530
do you work the simplest piece for me as

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,180
a content creator how we will consume

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,950
content how we currently consume content

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:23,750
is changing this goes both to the

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,690
methods we use Facebook Twitter social

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,299
media in general and it goes to the

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,299
devices but will be in the big work

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,200
stone temple consulting big name when it

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,150
comes to search engine optimization

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,549
their study laugh there's public still

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,889
beginning this year looking at visits to

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:51,700
websites in the u.s. between 2016 and

00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:54,590
2017 1.9 show you the web visits in 2016

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,930
2 trillion in 2017 so we're running a

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,590
fairly statistically compatible number

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:04,459
here only a 6% change and how content is

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,519
being accessed increasing on mobile

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:10,060
decreasing on desktop but the prediction

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,440
was also that by the end of this year

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,359
it's not unlikely to think the

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,690
two-thirds of all content being consumed

00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,130
will be done on mobile devices and the

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,410
other two pieces that come out of this

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,650
right now

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,570
is the % on time on time on site for

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,410
mobile devices during this period time

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:34,290
went from 40 to 49 percent we're staying

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:37,570
on sites via mobile devices far longer

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,820
mobile bounce rate is dropping 50 to 2.7

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,230
percent here it's clear that this

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,710
needing to pay attention to mobile

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:50,020
devices and P mobile site speed becoming

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:53,620
a actual ranking factor for google but

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,300
it goes beyond this piece of it that we

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,150
will continue to consume content in

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,280
different ways and it's not limited to

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:09,280
mobile virtual reality heads-up displays

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:13,150
and commerce smart appliances and it

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,210
stands to reason at that point that at

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,330
the way we consume content changes the

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,800
way we publish content has to change and

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,110
it really gets into heart for me of what

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,780
WordPress was it's a content management

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:32,860
system it was a way for everybody to be

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:36,820
able to publish content on the web you

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,080
think about mobile devices and the use

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,510
if we didn't shift to mobile

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,260
responsiveness we weren't gonna show in

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,880
searches most likely and that's not the

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,520
first time we've had this change how we

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,930
publish content when smartphones first

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,780
came out and we were starting to do more

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,450
more searches on these we build mobile

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,890
versions and dot versions of websites so

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,000
that we would show based on the way

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:04,630
we're consuming content the biggest

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,770
piece at that point however was that

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,450
we're doing this that our domain or the

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,340
site level we've done beyond that we now

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,460
have to change how we're bringing up

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,460
content deeper we have to have content

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,450
now at its base level and changing it so

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,610
it's like going from publishing

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,220
hardcover softcover but now we

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,979
the change from large from small print

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,840
to large print and even some of the

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,400
content when we present the content has

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,310
to change to fit the new way we're

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:39,819
publishing Gutenberg is far more than a

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,639
major shift and just creating edited if

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,819
for me as a publisher now and almost

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,680
seeing that Gutenberg is the evolution

00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,389
of WordPress as itself as a whole and

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,949
that was asked last week people still

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,550
called Gutenberg Gutenberg in the years

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,560
to come

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,780
now let's think Gutenberg is essentially

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,310
going to just eat breakfast he's good

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,210
marketer he would just be the new

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,610
default editor that there's no way you

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:09,520
disrupt the entire ecosystem for just

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:11,440
the editor that we already have and if

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,590
we're changing how content is consumed

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,349
or we are how to consume content changes

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,330
and then we're changing how we're

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,449
publishing content to match that

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:30,460
consumption changes it follows stupid

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:32,080
search has to change as well and that

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,460
got me started thinking about search

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,779
engine optimization of what this could

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,960
look like as we're pretty confident

00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:42,879
going forward now this is all pure

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,339
speculation on my part there is nothing

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,620
in any of this that's even remotely and

00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,110
proven or tested in any which way shape

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,009
or form so initially what everybody

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,810
saying well you should be calling this a

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,129
theory it's not a theory because there's

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,029
not even anything that's been newly

00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:00,129
tested this is pure random and all of

00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:03,430
this came out of two things that 10-year

00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:05,560
background plus in content marketing 20

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:11,379
plus years of creating content starting

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,759
Dreamweaver in 98 so and all the SEO

00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,610
emulation and everything else I've done

00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,080
with the past decade and everything was

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,120
triggered by something that was stated

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,550
by the warden grant Hendrickson here

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,750
last year during his talk on a deeper be

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,370
the future of WordPress my goal isn't to

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,009
say that this is how search is going to

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,140
change it's just to give you a glimpse

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,410
of something I can see changing as we

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,650
move forward in what

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,990
allows us to get in the future or how it

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,340
opens things up for us in the future so

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,870
I think it's none of us are behind the

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,880
most people aren't behind doing groups

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,220
they don't see you with it attempt to

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,010
gain from it just they see all the

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,630
problems it's causing and why things get

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,780
Matt's table s we paid we didn't do a

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,430
good job market and I think that in most

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,590
certain most situations and

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,260
circumstances that if we have the reason

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,100
to understand why things are being done

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,810
we're more likely to get behind

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,120
something and deal with all the problems

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:14,510
and work more cohesively to fix those

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:16,340
problems more it standing almost 29

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,490
minutes in one 129 made sense of

00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,700
two-thirds of the way through his talk

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,560
the web as a whole and WordPress is

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,790
moving towards this idea that there's no

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:34,190
such thing as a web page and instantly

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,720
my thought was at pages SEO because

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:42,680
everything we do with search

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:45,080
optimization is that page level we use

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,560
yo stop divides that page we've just

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,680
created Moz has to remain a 30 in their

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,390
page Authority and if you're certainly

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:59,380
doing away with the foundation for which

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,380
we optimize our content what do we not

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,180
know is that but then and how how did

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
the modules play into this and that's

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:14,090
exactly where my thought what because he

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:17,260
adds this bring in a slightly hey we're

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:22,040
not going to be creating pages or posts

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:24,310
we're gonna pretty flux and my leg over

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,310
enough

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,500
this is currently our trivia editor and

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,480
this is the default if you're just

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,830
playing this came off the 2018 Seattle

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,310
were campsite because we don't have

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,020
access to anything fancy we can't use

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,770
any page builders this is what we get to

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,110
start with this is not difficult to use

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,310
generally maybe make it look pretty but

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:53,340
I figured it out and I don't know what

00:10:47,310 --> 00:11:00,230
I'm doing it's functional problem is we

00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:04,020
create this page and we toss in headings

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,250
we toss them to title I know it's a

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,380
little difficult to say but for the

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,170
basic putting subtitles we put in

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,030
content we build all this out we have

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,430
now created our article or our page for

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,300
a website more specifically an article

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,500
in here and then we go to Yoast or

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,410
whatever we're using we try and make a

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,700
little dot sternum which is a whole set

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,630
of subject they don't all need to be

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:35,400
greedy the other piece we look at when

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:37,710
we're doing this our slug or SEO type my

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,430
meta description and we now have an

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,430
optimized page

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,730
but we're not going to pages so how do

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:51,800
we get any of this done for our content

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:55,560
and then it dawned on me what happens

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,120
when we go here and if anybody hasn't

00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,280
really play with it this is just pure

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,590
straight and or just pull that we have

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:08,210
graduate idle I'm in as a tighter story

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:11,160
which is a Content block and rather than

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,130
editing and putting all our stuff in one

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:19,260
little triple lock because your main

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:20,730
page now will be a single work block we

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,180
take every little piece and put it in

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,410
its own book and this is highlighted

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,850
just so you can see the different blocks

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,600
that we use to build a page that's the

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,590
same exact layout that I had before

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
chapter I created this slide I realized

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,610
it probably sure to something

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,139
different I would probably take four it

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,370
says paste recipe and then ingredients

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,790
in preparation or under it and that

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:45,170
would have been one large one and then I

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,600
would have taken the ingredients the

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,300
preparation and made them two separate

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,790
blocks within that block so the whole

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,610
idea behind the gutenberg on the editing

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,519
side of it is that we will have one base

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,009
block which is our content the article

00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,870
whenever we're publishing and it will be

00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:05,000
created out of a series of blocks and

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,420
each of those blocks could be created

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,160
out of a series of blocks so now we have

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:17,870
the ability to treat each individual

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:24,589
layer of that article independently so

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:27,709
rather than optimizing this we're gonna

00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:30,769
optimize each one of those what if we

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:32,660
could actually apply all the things we

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,880
are doing with Yoast to the page as we

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:40,310
know it and apply it to each of these

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,639
blocks individually what Gutenberg opens

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:47,899
up is if we can do that every single one

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:51,170
of these blocks can now be indexed in

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,839
Google and if you go back to looking at

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:58,089
things like mobile devices and virtual

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:01,310
reality if I'm sitting on my phone in

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:04,519
the grocery store trying to get my

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,480
ingredients list for recipe the first

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,980
thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to do a

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,170
search and I'm going to get an entire

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,850
article which is in the clue the

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,269
ingredients the preparation all these

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,949
things I don't need only thing I need is

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,500
a breeze and I'm gonna have to scroll

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,149
through search look for where the

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,889
gentleman where Bluehost turns around us

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,439
we can port them that says yeah you two

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:26,300
have basically do dual search search for

00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,630
the content and search them the content

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,029
for what I'm looking for Google is

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,550
already smart enough in it to know what

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,980
devices are being used for search down

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,519
to the poet's look at your Google

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,360
Analytics and it will tell you desktop

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,050
for mobile

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,529
it will tell you safari chrome edge

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,149
Firefox is the browser's being used so

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:54,209
Google knows what accident device is

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:57,779
being used access Google also knows your

00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:00,389
location they can easily pick up at your

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,709
grocery store on a mobile device you're

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,420
not likely looking for the entire

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:07,290
article and for intent that shows you

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,089
just the ingredients so now rather than

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,209
a search showing off this entire article

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:16,829
that you have scroll through it simply

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:20,819
pulls up the one in green block which is

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:21,959
all I need at that moment and we're

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,209
talking about other devices like

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,959
heads-up displays and I can be able to

00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:29,459
troll through content is going to be

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,499
consumed differently we have to make

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,079
sure we publish a different man and for

00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,790
me the heart of Gutenberg gets into how

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,050
contents being delivered whether that's

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,399
really what was in the back of the minds

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:43,819
first place it's what I see going

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,139
forward as a huge value for Cooper and

00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:50,069
if you're searching a desktop that gives

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:55,170
me x I can get this entire block of

00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:58,889
written my article my page and it shows

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:01,439
up but each of those additional Fox

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,839
could show up as well one article can

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:09,660
show up three or four different ways in

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:12,779
the search and now at the same point we

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,220
have what's showing in a search is much

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,149
tied to our demand for tea and how

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,300
authoritative our content overall is one

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:24,120
thing that Google did back and how long

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,910
ago is that the Rich Snippets that show

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,250
up in listings which could come from

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,220
less authoritative sources because they

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,750
directly into the exact question when

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,550
was the last time you saw rich snippet a

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:41,069
period of search it's been a lot I can't

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,389
remember last time I've seen one chicken

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,529
means these little content blocks

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,279
couldn't be the replacement for Rich

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,779
Snippets

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:50,430
contestant and Guttenberg allows us to

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,230
do that so again going back to the

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,249
competitive piece and wicks and neatly

00:16:52,230 --> 00:17:00,300
and everything else we're doing to end

00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:03,769
around almost because if this is

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,769
anything that comes to fruition

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,289
wordpress cos is a much bigger advantage

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:14,850
because now we're creating individual

00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:16,350
piece of content but this goes even

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,850
beyond that now in all the way actually

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:23,699
things are starting to roll through my

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:24,929
tenderness Lego kits are huge the best

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,459
part about these once you're done

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:29,010
building this all my fancy little thing

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,600
we call those little pieces we can sound

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,049
a little blocks and build something

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,960
different that's we have their work kits

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:41,760
to the collection we get more blocks to

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,780
use the advantage in Gutenberg that's

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,490
something it's all ready to talk about

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:50,970
is we have these reusable blocks that I

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,159
continue to create content using things

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:59,580
I've already done just making content

00:17:53,159 --> 00:18:00,780
creation going forward a bit easier so

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,399
at that point then those that came down

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,169
to what happens within WordPress and

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,510
optimizing on how to optimize these

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,549
basta more specifically and how do we

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,780
access these blogs I haven't figured out

00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,299
yet how we're going to be able to access

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:17,549
these additional blocks yeah not being

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:19,649
in codes up I have this thought about

00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:24,840
images that are being that we use in our

00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:27,830
sites and we have a media library what

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,880
if we also have a Content block library

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:35,030
thinking long term

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,030
kind of way to piece all this together

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,030
you can trade me blocks by uploading

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:45,899
blocks you crepey blocks as you create

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:48,210
as you're ready and you can title each

00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:49,860
of those blocks if I have this random

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,909
spot and something that comes to mind

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,570
that I want to write about I can

00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,950
actually create the block ahead of time

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,450
don't write the entire article and I

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,350
don't have this little dress stringing

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,669
the face going you're lazy hey all that

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,279
stuff I've never gotten to it now is

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,659
obsolete and now I have to figure out

00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,110
how does it use any of those pieces or

00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:13,480
thoughts we optimized all our images

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:18,039
every image gets URL which means we have

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,769
the ability to change the slug we get a

00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:23,889
description which really is for as I'm

00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:29,200
concerned becomes another description we

00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:32,559
can add tags we can have categories we

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,090
have a real way just on the surface as

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,639
to what's already being done in

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,580
WordPress top demise content before we

00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:42,490
even look at something like yes and

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,500
every time I opted not as an image it's

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:49,480
optimized still notice it to the article

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,039
that the description does include either

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,419
keywords or exactly what the image is

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
about who would be exactly what the

00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:59,679
contents of that slug is very specific

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,029
everything that I put in for titles and

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,559
everything by the way through uploading

00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,360
an image on your website make sure you

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,370
actually mean exactly what it is not

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,110
image not one two three or whatever it

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:13,330
be funny story on that and that's only

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,909
because I see this all the time hey if

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,710
you pin this image once the time your

00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:21,070
website it sometimes will pull the image

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:25,149
title not just the minute description or

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:29,620
to capture what you're using there was a

00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:32,830
very large company big name an image

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,019
about content theft which had a picture

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,679
of someone pulling a knife on out of the

00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:42,870
woman's pocket and when I went to pin

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,940
the image it's a phone in but jpg

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,320
so if you're not there's a little site

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,350
tip for you is to make sure you have

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,820
your images time again when you have

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:57,480
this capability to optimize images you

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,220
can do this with content blocks and it

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,720
makes it very easy to reuse because now

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,030
I go into my article that I'm creating

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,040
when we say add media I can add luck I

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,060
can scroll through and find my blocks

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,500
and have a discussion this morning that

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,320
we're not just talking about HTML code

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,420
for blocks which is what I think is

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,420
being talked about now the entire

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,570
content we write could be included in

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:25,890
that block so I get something inserted

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:29,240
my next paragraph of stuff and that

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,740
creates one other major issue for me

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,420
this definition appears on the multiple

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,580
pages within my site someone who's not

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:41,100
actually using it for example the price

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:45,000
that appears on multiple pages and I'm

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:48,210
not just talking - most of the time it

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,160
appears now it's as an image because as

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,940
small as it is it is still technically

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,140
duplicate content across my site and

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,340
well it's small enough not to

00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,630
necessarily trigger red flags I have two

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:08,820
one page one part of it that are

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:10,590
effectively the same taken from a

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,620
slightly different angle but enough that

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:17,730
Google can see them as duplicate content

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:21,450
if what content is truly duplicated was

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,430
just using these boxes and those boxes

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,210
have had their own URLs in each of those

00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:30,270
long URLs or the index previously

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,250
I'm not duplicating content the core

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,660
body is duplicated but Google's would be

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,090
smart enough to realize that it's made

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,590
of

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:39,000
pieces and therefore it's a new article

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,000
referencing the same content

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:47,620
conversation always comes up on updating

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,210
and rewriting old blog posts reasons

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:54,400
going back and forth through multiples

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:55,960
and which way you do this but the big

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,650
piece I come up with articles just as an

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,920
example how much does in mine industry

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:05,110
the state of SEO in 2018 and look at

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,540
what happened in 2017 in reference that

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:11,260
for 2018 we may look back to article

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,900
wrote 2016 saying the same thing in 2016

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,900
I said this in 2017 I said that 2018 I

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,400
said this but either you're constantly

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,880
linking back in reference and medial

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,530
articles and every time I see constant

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,910
hyperlinks that constant hashtags and

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,000
something as I'm reading it gets

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,700
annoying I just have to put the content

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,530
book if you want to read more of a

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,260
Content block is linked everywhere by

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,880
missing it or I don't have to link back

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:42,670
because it already creates the internal

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,500
backup and I can write these articles

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,970
without the fear of duplicate content

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,630
because I'm not active duplicating the

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:56,320
core content

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:58,120
I'm just reusing it but then still even

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,070
opinion about what Gutenberg can do for

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,950
us in this because we have this ability

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:13,320
now okay what if we have an additional

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:13,320
code into this infographics embed codes

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,210
what if we can take our content blocks

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,650
and allow them to be embedded in the

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:26,160
content of others then I have a way to

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,870
create an article referencing other

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,700
articles that are out there and instead

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,400
of inventing an infographic and

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,390
embedding image making embed paragraphs

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,040
of content right when we're writing

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,760
articles and we're referencing others

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,380
and we do we kind of paste into our

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,930
article and then we link back to the

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,610
original source

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,420
there are a number of times when those

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,580
links go dead now we're at dead links

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,330
out there there are a number of times

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:01,060
we've been correctly put the link in

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,180
there you're trying sometimes without

00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,040
realizing it it gets forgotten that's

00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,230
one thing when you're in but for whoever

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,800
you're linking that content to now has

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,690
lost the background opportunity and now

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,100
looks like potential content depth if

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,840
it's done on a purpose allowing content

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,770
to actually be embedded the same way

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,020
we've got images we eliminate that

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:29,310
problem as well so there's potential

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:35,290
huge advantage I can see going forward

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:37,510
with good birth and it's just the tip of

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,280
the iceberg for me everything on this is

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,810
unknown these are all just random

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,710
thoughts but I'm looking at this again

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:46,390
in that whole content perspective that

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,960
this is a way for us to take advantage

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:52,990
of how what we're writing will be

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,800
consumed and the biggest piece for me at

00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:00,670
this point is even if all this 100% long

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,530
for anybody who's creating content think

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,090
about each section of content even if

00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,930
you're using the third party page

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,610
builder right we'll take a textbook and

00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,080
then we'll put an image block and then

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,720
we'll finish our thoughts in the next

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,880
text block the thought is to creat those

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,920
text boxes if they work it's the same

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,380
thoughts as if they could stand alone on

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:26,470
their own because if this goes and those

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,360
blocks translate over your heads you've

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,160
already got a head start and if they

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,590
don't quite honestly your content will

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,150
be more readable and it's more likely to

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:41,280
the index editor and how things are done

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,280
now instead of having things split

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,380
so it sounds like what you're saying is

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,450
that some point Google is really going

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,850
to have to like understand these content

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,110
losses right and potentially like

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,070
they're out there with structured data

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,510
we've been playing around with

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,190
structured data which is essentially

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,889
it's kind of trying to do the same thing

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,289
right so it sounds like structured data

00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:18,450
might go by the wayside because of the

00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,279
volume that WordPress passed in terms of

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,960
the number of sites out there and when

00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,029
we're goes full everybody starts using

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,700
it that Google might then start

00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,960
interpreting it and using it the way

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,380
they've been using structured data seeds

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,309
to your content commenting cards and

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,139
snippets and whatever else they might

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:35,370
decide they want to hide one display

00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:37,950
okay

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,179
I think Morton's presentation whenever

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,769
you hear but I saw one where he was

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,299
basically saying like a small business

00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,970
at some point may not even need to have

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,100
the website just structure data well in

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,950
that part was poor that the core this is

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,600
that you have a situation now where we

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,639
have to be authoritative amount of

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,320
content within the site itself we have

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,730
to build up these huge sites these

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,139
authoritative sites can all these

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,990
backgrounds in order to have a chance to

00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:02,399
show in the first place yet when most of

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,559
us are searching and moving towards us

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,409
more natural search an AI and voice

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,590
search people are asking questions who

00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:12,570
are fully on their phones and going how

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,610
do I find my directions to this or I'm

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,110
looking for this particular recipe for

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,590
this what are the ingredients of that

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,059
recipe right the idea behind Rich

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,549
Snippets at least as I understood it was

00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,840
that you ask a question you get an exact

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:27,630
answer for it you want and that's what

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,029
pulps and it should matter the source

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,130
behind it if I'm going to research for a

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,600
larger article on my desktop I'm more

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,630
likely to be drawn from an authoritative

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,909
source so again it does give the smaller

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,960
brands a chance to show up and be found

00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,960
for specific pieces

00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:56,769
it seems that you would have to be

00:28:53,129 --> 00:29:00,369
careful with your content then because

00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:03,399
as we already see going on you can have

00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:04,899
something taken out of context so if you

00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,929
have a block of something where you're

00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:14,440
is making an argument of some sort and

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:16,210
you're not finished within that block of

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,039
content that's could go up around the

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,039
world then I mean do you see that as an

00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,529
issue it is it really gets done

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,080
the other neat piece for us is that we

00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:28,269
have content creation is its own little

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,269
art form and half the content out there

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:34,239
might be hard and it's not necessarily

00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:36,369
by default some of us just aren't good

00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,019
writers and the rest of it is we just

00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,119
don't know how to put things anything

00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:44,139
properly so we end up with this

00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:45,759
disjointed piece it does require better

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:47,320
editing at this point it does require a

00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,019
federal right it does require a better

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,820
content and in the end even with what we

00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:54,489
have now nothing else changed in way

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,639
search goes better content is going to

00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:59,169
rank better so again that goes to the

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:00,999
piece that are watching were thinking it

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:02,859
just exactly where you hid the depend on

00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,659
the head is that we have to pick even

00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,279
now how will right in keeping thoughts

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,339
to be these standalone pieces that

00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,169
justice showed up and the other thing is

00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:14,320
that we don't necessarily have to index

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:17,499
in my opinion every single look I only

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,389
have to index on blogs by default and a

00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:21,070
sitemap everything that's within there

00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:21,390
we have a choice exclude including kind

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,190
of

00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,340
yes all of the blocks would

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,559
automatically be included but we can no

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,480
index certain blocks or blocks could be

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,190
nobody gets by default and we just say

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,890
which ones we wanted so I can have a

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,440
heading block have no reason to be

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,150
indexed but yeah it really does mean we

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,549
have to take better attention or content

00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,650
or just I think in the end what we

00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:47,460
should be doing anyway and Gutenberg

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:52,049
just forces the issue you better follow

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,700
up to her question so I may have talked

00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:57,210
to you about this a lot you know how to

00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:01,049
talk about this but every paragraph is a

00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:05,130
block so if we want to keep the context

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:10,350
as writers do you recommend longer

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,890
paragraphs length of content in general

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:15,809
how long should you write how much

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,940
enough to get the point across with an

00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:19,860
estimate and actually do it justice if

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,419
it takes you 300 word for the 300 word

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,790
blog post and I don't care if it rants

00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,679
or not if it takes six thousand words to

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:28,320
get your point across right six thousand

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,740
dollars but each thought within that

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,210
process has to be blocked together so if

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,120
your thoughts going to span three or

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:39,750
four or five paragraphs it may be one

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,570
wall um block of text instead of three

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,400
or four individual blocks if I have two

00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,270
distinct thoughts that make up a piece

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,330
I'm talking about

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,130
why Guttenberg might be one block its

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,590
impact might be the second block and I

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,960
don't care only two blocks make up the

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,120
entire main content block if I have a

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,340
recipe piece where I have three and four

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,890
or five six different blocks they'll be

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,360
built that way so how we structure the

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:08,610
content once we written goes into making

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:14,640
sure it's taken in context and it's a

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:16,830
completely anybody else let's see

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:24,779
they're really good or just confused you

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:28,679
I said be here all day but they're gonna

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:31,830
kick me off the stage at some point so I

00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,870
agreed with your ear for sighting sounds

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,100
logical to me but I'm also getting a

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,390
picture of real nasty scr pees until

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,620
google and the others get a handle on

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,269
yeah

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,519
oh and that question it's gonna be nasty

00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:46,830
I mean some stuff will pull out a rag

00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,960
some clipping well in rank but again and

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,510
on some level someone's been plagued

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,100
with all along anyway like I mean the

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,450
structure data piece of it and then we

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,039
have Rich Snippets and then we have this

00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,690
move the longer meta descriptions and

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,340
we've got back shorter meta descriptions

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,159
a night at the fighters ready

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,690
yeah 155 characters for your meta

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,000
description and some of you says it's

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,039
240 or so on and then I that's time I go

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,529
back in after Yoast update I'm like wait

00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,679
a minute what and now it feels like it's

00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:15,480
only a hundred characters and even what

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,940
content is showing when you do share

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,679
content to Facebook they used to focus

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:26,010
on meta description of 155 characters

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:27,630
now it might get sunny so I keep seeing

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,130
all these little pieces in the shift to

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,049
mobile and mobile responsiveness and

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,649
anthe all of this is google playing with

00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,760
different pieces to see what works and

00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,409
Google I think is far more

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,940
forward-looking in that because we

00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:40,110
consume content differently there you

00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,029
know we have to show it differently

00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,299
which is again that logic piece which I

00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,639
appreciate your seeing is that somebody

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,639
on the back end has to say well we're

00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,409
missing a piece of them and I'm hoping

00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:54,539
it that this is what Gutenberg goes

00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,360
whatever it's broken or a I had to

00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,279
comment about well that's not how blocks

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,440
are actually being set up to be used

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,260
within Gutenberg it's too tight on the

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,909
back end I can't stand along with maybe

00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,289
that's just the first step of this and

00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,700
we've got to get it working and then we

00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:10,740
can figure out how we separate them out

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,149
because we need to be able to separate

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,270
these blocks out that I can write an

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,800
article which is a block and I can have

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,659
four distinct points each of which is a

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
block and I can have three distinct

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,300
points and each one of those blocks

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,159
which makes up that blocks and out of

00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,580
that twelve

00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,819
four in the one and everything else

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,819
there

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,210
so we're getting those two what can what

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,790
should be optimized and not on our end

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,040
but also Google's sorting out now really

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,349
what pieces have value so we'll get an

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,429
algorithm face someone on that it's why

00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:50,139
the questions that came up previously

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:51,760
we're talking about this was that we got

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,369
to get away from this notion of how long

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,780
or what an article is 300 words is what

00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,390
they use to interact in keeps now that

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,270
has to or what and I somehow think that

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,280
has to be antiquated anyway because the

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,770
point originally people ask me what at

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,390
least 300 words because if it's less

00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,300
than 300 words the likelihoods it really

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,890
can't be that authoritative and lester

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,550
only looking for something that can be

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,960
answer it in 100 words okay and when

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,540
we're pulling something from all of us

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,550
just 100 words I need another chef

00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,500
through a 3,000 word paragraph or house

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,030
to find it especially when I'm building

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,200
up to confirm something I'm post kind of

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,240
social meeting something oh I gotta lift

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:34,780
it up and I can't find it you like about

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:37,450
my desktop and trick but with the

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,490
algorithm only shifting it's yes it's

00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:44,460
going to get messy especially a new part

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,460
investing good for example teacher yes

00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:51,480
anything else

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,480
 thank you

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,300
