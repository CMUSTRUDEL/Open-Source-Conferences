good evening

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,240
africa uh welcome to uh this

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,000
keynote address uh to welcome you

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,320
especially to python africa 2020.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,039
uh i think the first edition that

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
brought all

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,000
python practitioner or community

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,280
together was last year in ghana

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,559
acro ghana is great and gathered again

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
albeit virtually how to fertilize share

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
best practice

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,800
and support ourselves to making python

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
community work for the continent

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
i think the image that i'm starting with

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
on my starting slide captures

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,600
that unique attribute of africa the

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,079
continent of amazing wildlife

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,840
at the continent of safari of course

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
it's also very metaphoric because it

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
tells us quite a lot which i'm going to

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,199
play around

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
and underpin that as the world comes

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,720
from africa

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
to look at our tourism which are largely

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,799
represented

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
by these amazing carnivores

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,080
you know there's also a lot that it has

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
to do

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
with some other dimensions of how python

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
is useful

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
in helping to build the content as a

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
strong

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
value driver improving strong economic

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
value to us

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,520
as a continent so today i'm choosing

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
my keynote uh to be around uh the

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,920
concept of building

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,720
a data voters continent what are the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
topics i always say well it's about

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,200
getting python into the safari

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
and finding that point of interceptions

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
about how

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
i would build a very impactful community

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,040
that makes a difference

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,759
in the continent at socioeconomic level

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
but the learning of digital skills that

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
python provides

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
can be a different the catalyst for

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
building

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
something that is significant in shaping

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,640
the capability of the continent to

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,080
maximize its full potential

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,920
um so um so in terms of my gender

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
uh broadly i would do quick self

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,680
introduction

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
because this will shape a lot of things

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
i'm gonna talk to

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,720
so that you can put in context on things

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
i'm going to talk about they're lively

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
based on who i

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,840
am and what i've done then i'll talk

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
about what does it mean to build a data

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
virus continent

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,720
we are all familiar with harvey was

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
carnivores

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
and omnivores so until we become data

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
boilers as a continent

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
but i'll talk about taking part onto the

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,599
safari getting into the trenches

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,440
get deeply penetration of python as a

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
catalyst for building the continent and

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
i will speak broadly about

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,160
our experience at data science nigeria

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
with ai book which was likely focused on

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,599
python for kids

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
and getting them to start coding early

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,280
through a structured

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
learning material and then i'm going to

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
talk about

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
for professionals i also talk about

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
strengthening

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
uh pride use cases on the continent

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
especially beyond the black box

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,599
speaking to fair principles and speaking

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,480
to some toolkits

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
a toolbox and libraries within python

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,000
allows us

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
to start operating at the level of

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
fairness responsible ai practice

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
which are very critical for the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,560
continent i will look at some critical

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
studies to challenge the community and

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
to explore

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
explainable

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
data practices using python and then

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
i'll talk about some of my experience at

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
data science nigeria which things that

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
we need to move from learning to a doing

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
community

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,959
how do we make our learning count for

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,200
the continent

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
so i'll look at two basic things to what

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
outcome is learning

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,480
how do we focus on outcome in terms of

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
innovation

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
and innovating for the continent

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,879
innovation

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,159
primarily innovating within the limited

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,080
infrastructure

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,400
that exists and then i'll talk about

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
solution mindset you know making codes

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
work for the continent

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,879
and i think those are some of the

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
conversations that people are raising

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
you guys are coding so what

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,400
you know how does coding make a

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
difference so we need to begin to

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,680
have those mindset and of course i'm

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
going to close

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,320
on what i've called the 5s of

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,520
african-centric python as a python

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,880
student practitioner researcher who is

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
interested in africa

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,600
what are those five things that you

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,479
shape your mindset your practice your

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
discipline

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
and how you really apply this to make a

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,840
difference so

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
since this is a keynote of taking the

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440
liberty

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,120
to be as blood-based as possible without

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,400
necessarily being too

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
specific in presenting on my body of

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
work

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
so once again i want to thank the

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,360
organizer for giving me the privilege

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
to provide these keynotes and very big

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
kudos

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
to the global python community and the

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,160
african community who are growing so

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
well

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
and the amazing nigerian community are

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,800
for building

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,240
uh you know for making python count as

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,960
a power driver in driving our creativity

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,600
as a continent

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
okay so in terms of self introduction uh

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
you know

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
i see myself as a computational social

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,440
scientist

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,560
what does that mean i use uh you know

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,000
big data advanced analytics machine

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
learning deep learning

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
to understand social behavior i

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
understand

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,919
peer-to-peer spending pattern

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,720
consumption behavior

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,160
digital consumption and more importantly

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
social pricing

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
i play in telecom space so i use it a

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,680
lot to understand

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
what we call organic consumption

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,560
behavior bandwagon effect

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
how do people influence people in buying

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
of course these are massive volume of

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
data

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,120
how do calling patterns predict people's

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,560
propensity

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,160
come together by together or perhaps

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
adopt a service together

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
for which i've also done a book on the

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
future is shared

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
which is largely talking about sharing

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
economy how people pull resources

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,840
together

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,520
to create shared value and that drive

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,080
holistic economy

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,560
and then i work for italko the largest

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,520
turkey in africa where i need innovation

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
and transformation uh and i founded the

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,280
united stands nigeria

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
which i'm humbled to say the biggest

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
fastest growing

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
air learning community on the continent

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
in terms of scale

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
impact and resolve that has created both

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,479
a research

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,039
in products in learning and outcome and

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
of course

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,360
in terms of becoming the biggest uh

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
talent pipeline for our country

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
of course i'm very hands-on than a

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,720
practitioner i see myself as

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,759
an industry mentor um so like i said i

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,440
believe that

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,319
you know coding data

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
analytics must drive business growth

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
that's been my experience

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
i've been a critical part of helping

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
business

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,639
to apply analytics data and coding uh

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
you know in different dimensions to

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
drive revenue growth

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
and for which i've been generously

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
rewarded

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,599
you know with prestigious awards

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,800
including what we call

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,280
empty and the low style world or

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,520
conceptualizing

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
you know a data engineering framework

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
that has led to significant revenue

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
growth

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
in billions of naira and that is the

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
mindset i also want to drop with the

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,639
community members

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
is beyond coding it's likely about

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,759
impact it's about making

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,879
a data count making your coding count

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,199
where you work of course i'm also very

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,879
hands-on i try to

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,039
play uh on cargo.com space which is

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,800
a place that allows you to compete i'm

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
not really compete not for me it's not

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,960
about competition it's not about

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
learning with other data scientists

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
uh in different parts of the world as

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
many of you would know

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
python is a strong enabler of data

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
science

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
of machine learning and deep learning

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
with vast array

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,160
of library that it presents to help us

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
demystify complexities and different

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
types of data

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
you know structural structure so i play

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
on cargo

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,280
which allows me to come to learn with

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
other data scientists in different part

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
of the world

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
uh you know some ideas it doesn't really

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,640
matter

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,159
for me what's important is i play as a

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,399
hands-on professional

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,360
in addition to my role as a c-level

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,959
executive

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,479
of course i'm also very involved in

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,080
academic research

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
writing papers my papers i like you

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
around

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,080
big data products you know and how we

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
can use data to understand low income

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,440
customers

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
we'd like to characterize our continent

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
as africa

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,160
and how we can create value for them by

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
understanding them

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,040
issues like financial inclusion social

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
inclusion technology inclusion

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,880
very very important to me to see how

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,680
interconnected data sources and multi

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,120
a segmented data outcome can be used to

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,839
understand the segment

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,000
i wish from the core of my uh phd

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,480
research in bad weather research and for

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
which

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,880
i also have a patent and social pricing

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,000
method are using

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
u.s patent uh data and artificial

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
intelligence

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
understanding interrelationships to the

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,040
start to be able to develop

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
a pricing algorithm based on relational

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
factors between multiple calling

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
entities particularly

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,160
in the prepaid telecom space of course

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,279
i i'm given to academic research playing

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,120
in top conferences or regular basis

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,800
of course to remain in the continent of

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
learning and which is also very

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,200
important to

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,800
also motivate and accelerate impact

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,600
within the community that are privileged

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,920
to lead data science nigeria

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,519
of course i believe that data must also

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,320
help the country so

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
i i strongly believe in supporting my

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
country

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,160
particularly in cuba 19 where

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,200
a lot of work that i did on flattening

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,279
the cough of epidemiological modelling

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,760
understanding how state con continuity

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,079
population density can help government

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
to plan palliatives which are lightly

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
aimed

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
at helping the vulnerable beings so i

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,880
did quite a lot of work

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
working with a nigerian governor's forum

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
for

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,440
the assistance of nigeria uh this was

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
actually reported by them so uh

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,200
just this for me our validation of

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,079
a the role that we must play as a

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
community

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,440
uh to make impact when and where it

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
matters

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
most especially at the time when data

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
became such a critical asset at

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
addressing the problem

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
of kobe 19. these are some of the

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,480
newspaper eclipse you can google them up

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
and see

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,839
from the work that i did for my country

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,399
uh to help

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,959
see how we can flatten the call about

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
providing class planning indicators

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,120
about providing clear guidance and also

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
helping the governmental plan

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,560
by predicting the epidemiological risk

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
and also identifying how to support the

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
vulnerable

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
while also name what must be on ground

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
in terms of

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
social preparedness and even medical

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,560
preparedness

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,079
efficiently tackle the crisis so i lead

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,200
data science nigeria

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,040
which is aimed at building 1 million ai

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,079
talents in 10 years

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,399
very big audacious vision

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,079
which started about three years ago the

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
result that we have seen

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
has proven to us based on hundreds of

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
thousands that we have touched

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
and indeed it's possible to build talent

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
in africa

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
that the talents of the world are in

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,720
africa and i live in a country where

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,680
there are 200 million odd people uh with

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,800
average age of 18 years so it's very

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
possible

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,240
if you focus you know on just one

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,639
million of that that is

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,800
actually less than you know less than

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,600
four percent of 0.47

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,240
you know of that population and channel

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
them

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
out to picking these skills that can

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,399
solve

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,360
a nation-building problem okay and of

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
course like i say

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
i'm very involved in research and data

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
science nigeria team

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,760
will continue to prove themselves as a

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,480
leading center of research

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
excellence on the continent i just won

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,959
best

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,399
poster award at the 21st ecm conference

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,200
you know which took place uh mid-uh mid

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
month of july uh for one of our works on

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,959
shared trust to end poverty

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
and promote financial inclusion so a lot

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,959
of our research

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
data science nigeria actually focus on

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,160
african century problems

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
how do we use local data to solve our

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,200
african central problem i'm going to

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
speak a lot of that

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,120
but we need to make data count and

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
that's how we're able to present this

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,000
work which you know apply some best

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,959
practice

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
a mechanism design a cloud-based social

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,120
trust

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,440
um we would build uh you know a social

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,399
verification system that can help

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,880
uh you know manage trust while also

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,519
driving for financial inclusion

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,920
of course last year uh we won uh you

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,200
know we won the mata impact award

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
at deep learning in dhaba in kenya based

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,639
on

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,240
the scale the scope the vastness of the

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,760
community we have built

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,399
and the diverse expression that

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,240
the project has found so i've been

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
introduced to that science nigeria i'll

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,399
move straight to

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
what we've all gathered

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,760
let's speak uh about data warehouse

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,040
continent

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,880
so like i said when i started we are a

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,399
continent of safaris

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,120
uh this is a continent of wildlife

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,160
a lot of people come to africa likely

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
because uh

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,040
you know amazing uh our

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,560
amazing um a wildlife you know to to

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
check particularly

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,320
a good part of eastern africa and even

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
southern africa even in the northern

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,079
africa there's still quite a lot even

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,920
west africa is not to see

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,279
so what does it mean to drive for a data

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,600
versus continent now

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,880
let's go to the source where this came

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
from that is

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,519
either the carnivores the habitables or

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
the omnivores which is likely about what

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,680
you consume

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,000
you know what you consume to take in

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,120
your nutritional strength that gives you

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
stamina

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
or survival you know for animals some

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,600
animal takes in

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,720
some anima taking herbs and they are

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,880
called habivos

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,279
so they take that in to get stamina for

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,399
survival so in the same way what you

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,680
consume

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,639
the tummy your liver whether it's flesh

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
or you take plants so when we talk about

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,320
data warehouse continents we're talking

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,519
about continent that is veraciously

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,240
taking in multiple data points or

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,199
data-driven innovation

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,160
to take out the required institutional

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,959
nutrients

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,199
for nation building while we leverage

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,120
data we consume data

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,680
you know and bringing the nutrients

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,720
daily for building sustainable

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,720
structures

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
to support our development you know

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,920
across all universe

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
that express our nation building

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,880
industries and that's what it means

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
a continent that takes in data for

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,079
making decisions

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
that takes in data for driving

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,320
opportunity

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,720
taking data for managing its risk and

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,360
getting data for predicting the future

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,880
and for casting future opportunity using

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
data to plan

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,199
how to optimize our health system and

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,320
data to optimize our educational

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
delivery system

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
and data to make all the difference but

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
there is a part to it based on my own

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
personal learning

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
and some of the research works i've read

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,839
and i've seen

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
that the way nations evolve digitally

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
and there is

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
there are milestones i mean i have time

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
to go into

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
a lot of the details but the

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,480
conversation is

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,199
innovation starts largely as a data

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
literate

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,320
nature where there's no awareness of

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
data

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
as a strategic asset so there is no open

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
data

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
our data are widely fragmented they are

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
not organized they are not structured

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
and then there are levels where we call

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
that data folks

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
in where the nation is data phobic to

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,880
the extent that

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
there's a fear that data is used it

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
might

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,759
make the government extremely

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,959
accountable and it can be a basis for

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
monitoring

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,120
for tracking uh government expenses

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
decision making

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,519
and all that and then we have a level

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,320
that we call data mixers where

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
you know there's a minimal use of data

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
you know

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,279
from limited sources uh most likely

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
maybe population

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,959
and government expenses for basic

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,559
reporting it's not more than that

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
i just reported but of course there's a

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
higher level of

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,280
of what we call data building which is

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,520
likely around

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,120
uh when we're able to use data from

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,919
multiple sources

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,000
for reporting and also for action which

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,520
means that government decision

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,559
national building decisions are uncut on

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,760
the direction provided by data so

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,640
data-driven decision-making knowledge

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
driven

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,400
you know uh governors where

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,200
accountability

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
requires a lot of triangulation and

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
extrapolation of course

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
there's the highest level called the

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,480
date of worse where

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,960
you know nations start relying on data

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,919
or socioeconomic growth which means that

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
data drives innovation drives value

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
creation

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,960
on a sustained basis i mean i'm sure

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
there's a lot of learning that we can

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
pick from

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,000
uh the it could be 19 story you know

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,679
the way nations use data to respond i'm

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
sure almost read what happened in

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
country

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,360
uh like like like china how data was

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,960
used good for tracking for

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,880
picture uh even in or even in diagnosis

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
you know a lot of data are brought to

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,520
pair and even in helping people to get

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,960
back in terms of economic recovery

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,360
a lot were likely data driven so nations

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,559
must aim to become data warehouse

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,480
by being proactive in taking in data

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
severe consuming data

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
such that you are able to derive

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,760
nutrients i call it institutional or

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,559
governance or nation-building nutrients

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
that help to provide even the national

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,640
building muscles

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,760
required for a nation to stand tall in

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,880
the imagine

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,360
fought industrial revolution essentially

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,440
we cannot have fought industrial

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
revolution at scale in africa

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,720
if our nations do not become gate of

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,919
wars which means

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,280
relying on data for decisions using data

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,760
as a power engine to drive innovations

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
and of course scaling up our population

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
will have the right data institutional

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,840
skill

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,080
to apply those learnings in solving

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,240
problems across all levers of government

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,360
so having established that i'm going to

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,679
look at some of the

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,960
case studies that should inspire many of

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
us as young

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,720
uh python users on the continent that

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,840
the continent seeks

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,799
programmable data giving innovation that

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
can work on an

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,840
existing infrastructure as you use your

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,280
python you know write nice codes

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,880
on usable data always be solution minded

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,360
how does this help

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
to create solutions in africa from

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,280
crisis response

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,919
to economic empowerment to education

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,039
environmental equality and inclusion

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,120
health and hunger infrastructure social

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,520
sectors how do we use

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,200
those learnings to make a difference and

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
these are some of the things i call the

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,679
outcome-based mindset

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,600
where we are learning coding because we

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,840
want to solve a problem and we do

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,640
have enough problems to solve on the

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
continent

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,240
and that's why i've started by pushing

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
for the need

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,720
of a data voters continent of course

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
the sustainable development goals has

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,039
provided us

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,880
a structural framework around areas of

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,640
interest that we should be looking at

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,039
i always streamline this to four

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
critical ones i believe are very very

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,720
important for africa

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,760
which i always encourage any young

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
africa

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,120
who is involved in you know you know

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
data ecosystem or programming ecosystem

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
to look at

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
how do we use you know python

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,400
programming and data scale

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,360
and the various extensions to track

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,080
poverty

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,159
you recall that our paper that won the

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
best posters to the first acn

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
was born out of that how do we use it

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,520
for diagnosis

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,159
knowing that we have very limited number

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,840
of doctors limited number of hospitals

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,880
and hospital beds

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,640
how do we leverage or lift work our

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,679
technology to be able to deliver good

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
health in africa

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
same for quality education which is

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
another area where

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
we in data science nigeria is scaling up

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,360
to not just

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,559
living in data alone now and now using

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,559
our knowledge

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,880
to be able to deliver bespoke learning

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,440
for even the disadvantaged children

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,960
across nigeria using mobile technology

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,559
in an innovative way that

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,559
is the mindset that each of us must have

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,640
you know that is not just about coding

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,039
it's about coding to solve problems

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,320
and that's what makes us relevant i make

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,880
a narrative of

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
digital skills and data to be appealing

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
now to make sense

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,120
in our continent there's so many things

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,440
how to use data

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,360
and of course the area of microfinance

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,840
largely allowing job creation

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
economic growth financial inclusion

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,760
giving access to businesses

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,039
especially household businesses

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,280
household farmers

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,240
uh you know uh small businesses to be

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,120
able to scale up

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,880
on a sustainable basis and drive value

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,799
which of course have direct impact

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,120
on education for their children good

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,320
health and of course bring the cycle of

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
poverty

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
and this also comes to say there's a lot

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,600
of opportunities

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,960
inherent in this you know um a

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
reset published by ifc uh it indicates

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
that

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,919
as much as two million jobs available in

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
sub-saharan africa

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,720
you know that will require these skills

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,960
by 2030. that is just a nine years time

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,799
or 10 years time which means that the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,720
skill you are building today

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
is going to be ultimate game changer for

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,799
the continent in the next 10 years

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
so you need to be as pervasive as

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,400
inclusive

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,159
and as solution-minded as possible so

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,039
that you are using the skill to make a

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
difference

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,280
on the continent of course there are

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,840
certain key drivers

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
that support the readiness index index

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,280
and this has been provided

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,840
by a researcher was done by oxford

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,080
inside for ai for development

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,440
which is a network in africa together

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
the ai community

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
understand that what are the key drivers

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,280
for readiness

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,600
i won't bore you with the first number

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
of focus on infrastructure and data

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,320
and also skill and education and that is

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,039
likely to call my conversation today

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
that including a database continent we

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
must scale up

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,000
our data and infrastructure capability

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
even by the time we bring our

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,440
programming capability

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,440
into the table of our python we need

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
sufficient data to be able to make

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
informed decisions

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
and of course skills and education must

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,919
be very very critical in making all the

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,320
difference

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:39,520
so having established a big need around

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,200
we must build the data world's continent

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,720
and it's all because it's going to

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
change our narrative

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,559
it's going to help us to solve our

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
problems it's going to create jobs so a

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
lot of african children

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
and adults and more importantly he's

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,559
going to make the continent

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,000
maximize the benefit of the fourth

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,880
industrial revolution

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,919
so the imperative is that we as python

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
community

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
must be more aggressive more intentional

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
and more definite

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
on how we deepen the penetration of

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,919
coaching skill on the continent

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,679
taking part into the safari ascension is

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,159
about going to the trenches

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
and getting as many people as possible

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,080
to understand

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,200
how programming skill will be a critical

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,200
game changer

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
for building the continental

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
competitiveness

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,960
in the next few years to come even

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,000
indeed we are ready as a continent

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
to play big imagine a fourth industrial

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
revolution

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,799
so and i'm going to focus lively on what

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,600
we've done in nigeria

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
in data science nigeria around creating

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
a bespoke book

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,480
that targets young kids to introduce

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,960
them to python

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,279
and artificial intelligence in a very

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,840
exciting way so this is a book targeted

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,919
at elementary students and any beginner

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,120
will want to get to understand what ai

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,120
is and understand how python is enabling

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,840
or will be a critical catalyst

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
for ai application building in the

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,799
future

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,240
uh so if you look at the book the book

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,360
is purely

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,760
simplified in cartoon format with a lot

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,440
of previous friendly images

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,159
that attempt to demystify

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
all the key concepts that are generally

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
you know known

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
in artificial intelligence from machine

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,720
learning

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,760
which is likely understanding patterns

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,600
to deep learning

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,400
in a very friendly uh in oriented

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,240
images and language and also introduce

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,080
it to them python as well

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,000
but the book combines artificial

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,200
intelligence and python

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,559
for beginner in the language that makes

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,799
sense for kids

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,919
breaking it down to stimulate their

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,720
curiosity

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,720
get them excited and get them to want to

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
get into python words and i'm glad to

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
say that

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,960
this is a book that a lot of schools in

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,320
nigeria are not adopting

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,000
and i'm glad that has gone beyond

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,080
nigeria uh you know

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
a lot of people outside nigeria

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,039
including united states or america

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
are buying the books and usually uh to

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,080
get

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,039
a lot of kids excited about coding as a

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,679
solution

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,880
uh development platform uh so these are

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
some of the pages

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
uh from the book which is just purely

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,080
simplifying

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,240
you know you know python and exciting

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,159
kids getting them stimulated

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,840
getting them to appreciate what it means

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919
very simplistic way

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,120
you know written in their language and

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
beautifully

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,159
the feedback has been awesome to the

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
extent that some kids

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,360
are picking the books and they are

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,000
putting on their own without a teacher

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,760
and that was the intention create a book

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,559
knowing that kids are very smart on

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
their own

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,440
they can pick your phone and they can

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,720
demystify functions so the intention is

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,760
pick a book that can allow you to learn

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,600
how to code without any instructor uh

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
you know and of course it comes with a

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,760
lot of activities

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,120
in a lot of activities that you can do

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,760
practice on your own

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,520
see your results check up your answers

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
and then you see whether you are right

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
where you are whether you are wrong

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,880
you know and of course the book is

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,000
available on our platform

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,080
amazon apple you play and of course it's

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,960
also available for anyone to order all

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,679
over the world

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,279
but one thing we have done so amazing in

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,960
nigeria is the fact that

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,919
we've created the speaks to my intention

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,799
which is

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,240
we need to keep it penetration of

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,159
knowledge what we've done

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,960
is to work with a lot of organizations

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,399
in nigeria who are helping us to print

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,760
the book in book

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,760
so if you look at what you see on the

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,240
screen you see this edition

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,440
is sponsored by this organization this

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
edition is sponsored by this

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,000
organization

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,080
so we're working with a lot of

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,480
organizations in nigeria

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
who are helping us to mass produce these

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
books

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
uh with a view to helping a lot of

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,440
children

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,200
particularly uh you know uh in the

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,039
disadvantaged communities

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
to be able to have access so we're just

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,080
putting the books free of charge and

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
we're doing it

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
through trade the teachers program so we

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
teach the teachers and we give them the

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,480
book and then

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,159
that allows us to get it into

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,640
communities you know

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,840
so that kids can get started you know

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
and then we do this to train the

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,440
teachers so that they know

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,559
how you can do some your python even on

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,640
the phone

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,760
when laptops are not available what can

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,200
i do on the phone

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,679
so these are things we're doing to

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,799
deepen penetration because we believe

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,520
that in building

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
intervals continent we must focus on

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
building talent

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,600
and building talent must not be elitist

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
it must not be elitist we must be

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,600
intentional

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
and be deliberate to deepen penetration

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,799
by

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
be by being inclusive as much as

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
possible

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,919
and this is what we try to do here you

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,960
know in nigeria of course we also have

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,000
uh an ai hub where we train uh

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,679
kids uh not just to land python but to

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
see how python works

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,919
in application through our various

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
summer school targeted at kids

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
at our here i hope of course we go

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,200
around schools to give them the free

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
book these are public schools

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
in nigeria where the books has been

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,760
given and to stimulate kids to see

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
why they need to learn python why they

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
need to learn ai

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,000
and why they need to start early but

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,320
these are you know schools where

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,080
there are no laptops but we go there

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
with laptops and go with the books

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
and the intention is to plant the seed

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,720
and stimulate their curiosity that

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
indeed

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
a lot of things are possible to the

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,919
power of creating combinations of zeros

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,600
on one

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,440
to solve problems on the continent

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,799
having established that the next thing

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,440
i'm going to be talking about

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,960
is around uh uh this is more

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,000
professional for those of us who are

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
professionals

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,679
uh the next point i'm going to talk

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,159
about is the fact that if

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,440
we're going to be data voice we must

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,679
create solutions

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,039
that work for the continent we must

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,960
create solution

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,120
that solve problems on the continent

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
especially if you have followed my line

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,760
of thought a lot has to do with

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,240
creating solutions around the

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,440
sustainable development goals that solve

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,279
real problems

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,320
problems of education inclusion hunger

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,919
you know poverty alleviation

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,279
you know agricultural optimization

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,600
and because we would do all this people

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,640
must be very important to us

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
we must take people we must be driven by

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,120
people-centric

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,840
programming people-focused programming

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,919
and that's why

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,360
i'm going to talk a lot about the need

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,840
for us to move beyond

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,080
black box and to apply in the fair

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,360
principles so

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,720
outcomes that are that that has fairness

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,760
accountability interpretability and very

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,200
huge sense

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,200
of reproducibility so what that means

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,360
is that as we build our solutions

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
whether in terms of programming or

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,240
passing our own domain which is a data

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
science

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,600
for those who use uh python a lot of

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,159
their program for their data science

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,799
work a lot of libraries and python does

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
that

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,159
uh there's a need for us to know that if

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,720
you want to build a data voice continent

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,480
we must have a sense of accountability

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,440
in how we make our model

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,880
accountable and now we are very careful

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,360
in making sure that

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,200
the data that we use to make decisions

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,960
truly reflect the reality

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,480
and that's what i'm going to speak to

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,399
especially for professional

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,840
and i'm going to spend time to explore

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,120
some of those uh

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,080
some of those um a library within uh

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,799
within

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,440
uh python that allows us to begin to be

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,640
more

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,399
uh people responsive uh

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,880
people responsible as we build for

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,760
africa so the whole conversation here

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,919
is the need for a major paradigm shift

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
prior to now building solution has

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,960
likely been

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,600
our black box which is i don't know what

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,880
happened i just throw in my data

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,799
is my parameters and uh i do some

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,320
tunings i just

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,320
and then there's a land function that

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,640
comes and then the decision is made

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,279
the recommendation outcome comes and is

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,519
used by the user so it's purely

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,720
uh why is your effects so it's purely

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,760
about prediction

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,080
um so sometimes i do not know why

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,679
certain things are what they are i do

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
not know what i need to do to make it

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,799
better

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,039
in terms of success or failure i do not

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,840
know what i can trust i do not know what

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,000
features or variables are significantly

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,720
driven the decision that is being made

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,480
i do not know which features is most

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
critical or most important

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640
uh so i do not understand those biases

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,559
that might be ignorant to my data

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,279
i may not even have visibility of the

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,320
else so we have moved beyond that

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,159
what we now call explainable ai what is

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
the fact that even after you have

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,880
blocked

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,039
your data and you have gone through a

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,240
step-by-step machine learning process

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,279
the most there's a need for an

00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,640
explanatory interface

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,600
before it is used so we call it e

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
function y where i want to know why i

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,360
want to know why not i want to know what

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,519
variable is driving what

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,360
i want to know what will make this field

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,200
i want to know what will make this work

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,760
i want to know why i should trust this

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,080
data it will not just be black box right

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,360
i just take it and i use it so this is

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,000
very important

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,039
to uh african communities if we're going

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
to use this

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,240
to make decisions about people's lives

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,279
uh it becomes very very imperative

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,960
that we are aware of these critical

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,559
issues you know because when we talk

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,360
about uh

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,640
inter uh interpretability like your

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,760
explainability

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,720
we're talking about ability uh to

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,679
to to which you and i you know can

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,000
understand the basis for a decision

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,519
you can understand what went in and then

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,960
you robust enough

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,840
are we taking insufficient data points

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,720
you know and how was the model developed

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,960
you know what

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
were we able to detect or remove bias in

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,520
the process and even the outcome

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
you know is it reproducible in terms of

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
the entire mechanism

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,760
and the outcome we explained to the

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,679
extent that we can justify our outcome

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,280
we can improve on the outcome so

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
somebody can pick my work

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,240
and use it the work can be done in ghana

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and somebody in tanzania can use it

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,440
you know what can be done in sudan and

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,399
somebody in mozambique

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,560
can make you better and their clarity on

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,359
how to explain to control where we know

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,599
things

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,000
that are not working to norms and of

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,119
course how does this help us to discover

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,960
because the traditional you know uh

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,720
modern development tend to be complex

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,240
because a great function is

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,399
sophisticated manner

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,440
there's a need for us to know that we

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,639
cannot build

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,159
a data virus accountable continent where

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,879
data is used to make decisions for

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,800
people

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,280
especially in the areas of things like

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,480
loans in things like crime disease

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,760
diagnosis

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,200
you know uh without you know having a

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,440
clear understanding of explanation so so

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,280
you know i'm glad to say that um you

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,839
know python provides us

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,079
a lot of visualization you know uh

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,880
explanatory and interpret application

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,200
tools

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,160
you know that allows us to create

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,280
solution

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,480
that explains itself we create model

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
that explains

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,000
in the bias in the data and also you

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
know explain

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,839
the likely complexities you know that

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,079
may be inherent

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,680
in the model that has been built so i'm

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
going to spend some time to pick few of

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,760
them just to

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,440
encourage us as commissioner patricia to

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,680
begin to have this mindset

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,040
you know as you build your model as

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,480
bringing your data

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,359
being the practice of sustainability

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
the practice of fearness the practice of

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,800
accountable

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
you know model development because those

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,560
are critical

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,560
to build trust in africa you know those

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,240
are critical to build models

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,000
that truly make a difference because we

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
have not just built models

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
built by the computer we built models

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
that we can interpret it's not just

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,520
white box

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,119
is a transparent box where we understand

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,240
everything that has been brought

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,040
together

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,599
to to to to generate the desired outcome

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,079
so

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,160
i will speak to some of them and this is

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,280
particularly for practitioners

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,320
um i'll speak to the first one um

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,160
uh which is uh le5 which helps to debug

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,200
machine learning classifiers

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,560
uh as it reads is actually an accounting

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,280
for a spleen like a five year five year

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,520
old that's

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,200
where the name came from you know so

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,960
it's a visualization library

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,599
so if you have not tried it uh you know

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,320
to do that it helps you to explain your

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,320
prediction

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,960
um so and it comes very easy to

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,480
understand and is very very intuitive

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
um for me it's actually one of the

00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,280
easiest or most of the frameworks which

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,200
i'll be used

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,720
uh but the only issue might be that it

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,640
doesn't support uh

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
uh model like no significant amputations

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,400
but for me is a great starter you know

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,720
i've also provided a link

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,880
uh for some people for you to also check

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,880
it out uh what i'm pushing for

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,520
is that we build the data virus

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,359
continent if we also have accountable

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,079
models if our use of python is

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,480
accountable

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,359
and i'm glad to see that python has

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,560
given us

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,119
libraries toolkits and and two boxes

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,000
to be very accountable in building our

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,160
models

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,240
uh so the next one i'm talking about is

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,000
lime i know quite a lot of guys

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,839
in data science nigeria are familiar

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,560
with line and that is local

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,359
interpretable model acoustic explanation

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,040
at the south

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,960
um it helps to

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,880
provide explanation for individual

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,359
prediction from a wide range of

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,320
classifiers so it's quite wide range

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,160
um so um it's more than agnostic so it

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,960
can be applied to any machine learning

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,800
model

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
uh it's based on understanding how

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,160
predictions change so it's a great tool

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,800
to explain

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,079
it's very simple it's very

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,720
understandable and it does not actually

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,119
require

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,200
a lot of effort so i think this example

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,359
from a medium article below which

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,280
clearly summarizes what it does but

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,079
after the model is done i want to

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,480
understand

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,160
what was used to predict the likelihood

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,079
that somebody has got a few

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,040
in the midst of several features that

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,880
were used so lyme comes in as a spinner

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,760
so it is

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,760
indeed the patient has a fuel which is

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
the traditionality that a model does

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,960
but what line does is that is analyze

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,160
for me

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,359
the symptoms in the patient history that

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,720
led to that prediction

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,079
so what that does is that empathy

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,119
this is a doc to know what the mother

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,599
has used to build this decision because

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,640
it may just be funny that the variables

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,480
or the future

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,400
that led to that may not necessarily be

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,280
relevant but because this

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,880
person making the inference is a doctor

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,920
so he can see that sneeze

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,160
earthquake i don't know sorry heavy are

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,800
portrayed as contributing to few

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,280
addiction why no fatigue is evidence

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,200
against

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,320
what we did a doctor can make an

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,960
informed decision

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,920
whether to trust the model or not since

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,320
they have

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,200
a better hands-on understanding of what

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,440
is happening so

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,599
essentially these all issues of

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,320
explanation it tells you

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,839
what is driving the decision so that you

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,560
can now use what we call your domain

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,280
knowledge

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,720
this is very particular for us in africa

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,680
that we cannot build

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,520
a data virus continent where data is

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,000
actually helping us to make

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,920
informed decisions about nation building

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
you know building very strong health

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,720
system

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,480
where health facilities are answered

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,800
without having a form

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,760
of explanation that is why using tools

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,760
are like

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,960
like line you know local uh

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,359
interpretable

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,480
uh model agnostic explanation are very

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,200
useful so

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,359
my child today encourage you uh that do

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,880
not just be mother creator

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,200
also be interested in moodle

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,000
explanations now whatever the outcome

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,680
is you are interested in why not just

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,720
i'm not just in what

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,760
why why is in my model like this

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,040
and what are the likely biases you know

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
that might be inherent

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,520
uh in the model the other one

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,000
is sharp uh sharply addictive uh

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,240
explanations uh it's also very good

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
uh to detect individualized access

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,839
predictions may be concerning and then

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,720
you can do some

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,520
a deep dive into specific reasons uh the

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,400
data

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,599
has led us to certain decisions so it

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,359
guides you towards

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,760
i want an irrational you see on the

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,720
screen uh a use case here

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,839
uh to see the impact on how gender can

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,160
be a critical

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,680
a determinant and it can you know be a

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,560
basis for a bias

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,599
in a data set you see on the uh y axis

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,280
is the usual

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,160
value um values actually they call and

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,839
that's what

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,000
it uses to explain individual

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,359
predictions

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,680
for those who are familiar with game

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,400
theory which is likely by reinforcement

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,079
learning

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,319
my sharpening values are derived from

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,480
there where every single feature

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,160
in that data set is a player and the

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,599
final word is the prediction so

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,040
depending on the reward

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,440
shuttle valleys tell us how to

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,839
distribute this one among the players

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,160
equitably and fairly so he's one of the

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,280
uh externatory tools we didn't like uh

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,000
within python

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,480
that also recommend uh yellow brick also

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,440
comes

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,280
strongly recommended because it's all

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,520
about visual as you can see

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,960
yellow green is all visual it's a suit

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,599
of visual analysis

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,880
and that music tools that help you uh to

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,640
do quite a lot of visualization

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,880
especially within us um uh scikit

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,599
lan um so it uses the concept of

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,760
visualizer as you can see

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,599
on the screen and it's very similar to

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,359
transformers or models

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,440
so they learn from data by creating

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,400
visual representation as you can see

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,480
of the modern selection workflow you

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,000
know the workflow the motor selection

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,599
and it helps you to visualize the

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,760
features of the data

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,440
so it's the ultimate dashboard for all

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,599
the features so you can see

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
what is driving the desired outcome for

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,160
those of us

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,359
who have used um psyche land

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,839
and many other tools within uh python uh

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,079
pandas and all that

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,800
for uh for machine learning you will

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,760
understand the imperatives of being able

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,839
to understand

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,000
uh what is driving your outcome uh

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,319
future importance and all that

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,240
um the last outdoor about is alibi um

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,280
which is also very very important

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,760
as you like your pollution spectrum it's

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,440
a model inspection and its application

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,920
um it's very very good good for local

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,520
global explanation methods uh likely for

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,160
classification and all regression

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,800
problems

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,800
as you can see in the syntax uh written

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,560
on the screen which i've extracted

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,040
on the link below so you can check out

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,119
the link to read more about it

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,880
there's an extension to this now are

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,240
called alibi detect

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,400
which is a python package for focus

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,680
which is focused on uh

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,160
i think outliers are adversarial

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,000
and conceptual detection interesting

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,880
there's a paper that has just been

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,760
published

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,359
i see the date at 13th of july and the

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,839
people are just released

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,280
so it has the link and check out for the

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,040
for these data

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
quite amazing stuff that allows you to

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,520
monitor models

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,040
in production or expandability and so

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,319
that you can detect applies

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,920
and data drift um so it's also provide

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,480
explanation for

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,440
history prediction so this is a paper i

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
would recommend

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,599
for you check it out uh so that you

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,760
begin to see how

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,599
a lot of great work you do really work

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,760
in production because a lot of us

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,640
most of the models we develop end up on

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,640
our system

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,240
or perhaps only on cargo or on cng.com

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,640
but when you want to build models for

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,359
companies i work in a company where

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,520
we make decisions on 65 million plus

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,160
customers on a per second basis

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,720
and so monitoring uh models become

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,560
critical

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,880
you know along that life cycle to be

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,560
sure that all the basis for decision

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,440
making are well understood

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,760
and there are no surprises as well you

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,000
know our clever performance metrics

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,359
uh both for offline and online tests

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,400
when a model

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,960
is deployed in real life so uh this

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,160
other one

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,200
is also a very nice uh drag and drop

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,000
i really i really like it um something i

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,480
also

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,520
uh recommend is coffee and land it helps

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,920
to access

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,359
and mitigate unfairness uh in machine

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,920
learning models

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,200
you know it's quite an amazing tool so

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,640
it helps you

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,040
to understand the most sensitive

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,040
features

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,599
between performance and of course

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,240
fairness of your model which one works

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,240
best

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,280
especially when you see disparity or

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,119
predictions

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,400
uh and it shows you these are features

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,000
levels so

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,599
so it allows you to understand how the

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,119
performance magic work

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,160
along various uh uh uh indices that you

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,920
are using

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,319
to build your model um so i use a lot of

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,520
fairness metrics it has very good

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,800
interactive

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,200
uh uh dashboard as you can see

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
but essentially some people are maybe

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,800
impacted

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,640
so so in your decision making so it

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,839
likely mitigates unfairness your

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,920
classification

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,359
and of course in your regression models

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,160
so you actually see

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,040
variances at the level of your features

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,599
that you use

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,720
so uh but like now but as you as you

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,160
know you know

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,280
um very increasingly dynamic word so we

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,200
keep learning

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,440
uh and that takes me to the next uh

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,280
paper which was released in 12th

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,000
february 2020 around

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,319
the fact that in as much as you use

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,880
explanatory tool to make your model

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,640
you know interpretable we now have

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,760
there's a way you can also fool those

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,200
tools

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,800
so this paper looks at a line and sharp

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,079
so we'll say is not yet as far

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,920
as explanatory uh uh moodling is

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,640
concerned so what do i mean by that

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,680
making our data accountable knowing what

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,079
you know goes in

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,960
uh into the black box and knowing why we

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,040
should trust

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,880
the decision we're making why we should

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,599
trump the more why we should trust our

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,599
mother

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,680
and why we should be interested in

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,760
everything about our data workflow

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,920
and our data journey how the data was

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,520
collected how the data was labeled

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,680
defined and completed

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,720
structured managed thought over a period

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,480
of time so

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,280
pulling continues for those who are

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,319
familiar uh with adversarial attacks

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,280
uh or almighty god generated by the

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,040
syrian network

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,480
a lot of works will continue yes i

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,359
challenge the community

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
to continue to look at how we can con

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,079
build

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:08,000
uh more of uh uh adversarial

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,480
tax solutions uh to manage

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,680
our ability to explain our models

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,640
particularly because

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,560
in africa decision will be very critical

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,079
since we do not have any alternative we

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,000
rely only on mothers

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,160
so our mothers must be extremely

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,760
accountable they must be fair

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,079
and they must be interpretable they must

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,760
be robust they must be inclusive

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,000
and they must be responsible to the

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,400
extent that there is a clarity on

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,400
indicators of reproducibility so that

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,880
what has been used in community aid

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,640
and also be used on community b so

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,599
having established this i was starting

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,200
to round off

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,960
my my questions by speaking to building

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,280
a learning and a dream community

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,000
and this for me is a strong passion that

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,000
i have

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,119
probably been involved in building data

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,599
science nigeria

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,440
and we need to build a community towards

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,359
outcome that solve problems

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,920
on the continent and the fact that we

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,680
must have solution mindset

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,040
and what do i mean by that what is the

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,960
solution mindset

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,280
if you look at the image on the screen

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,319
uh two uh there are two sections to this

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,440
image

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,720
um this are things that are familiar to

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,040
us in africa

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,720
they're familiar to all of this uh

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,760
they're part of our decorations in

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,319
africa

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,000
and this is a new technology coming but

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,400
if you look at where you place

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,160
the two of them their life is the same

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,680
when you play this and where you place

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,040
this allow you to say

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,960
but what matters is that there's

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,960
something we're used to in africa

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,240
there must be a way we find a blend

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
between the two

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,599
how we link what we know with the

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,440
technology imagine today

00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
so i want to see technology solutions

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,599
that are aligned

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,000
to establish cultural norms and some

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,000
cultural icons and african centuries

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,520
and we can begin to digitize them as

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,839
solution carriers

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,839
you know in delivering solutions that

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,920
resonate with the sensitivity

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,800
and population of africa and that's why

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,359
we need to think from a safari mindset

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,119
create solutions and have the nuances

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,880
the popularities

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,160
of the continent and that is what i call

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,800
solution mindset

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,800
solutions that solve real problems if i

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
want to be solution for a farmer

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,720
i'm not building it from a western

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,319
central perspective which is this

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,000
i'm bringing my solution from an

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,559
african-centric perspective

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,319
asking questions around what currently

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,880
exists in africa today

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,599
that is related to what i want to solve

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,559
and now build on these popular domain

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,319
where i blend technology and of course i

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,640
blend it with cultural

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,520
truth such that the adoption becomes

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,040
easier

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,880
because if we really want to drive our

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,200
adoption of technology in africa

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,720
we must build on top of what is true and

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,280
what is meaningful to the content that

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,319
is one of the narrative i like to preach

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,319
in the continent

00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,720
and then you must create a community

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,359
that makes a difference so in nigeria

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,960
we have gone beyond crazy community and

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,280
for learning we have also been the

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,400
community that

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,240
and please data because if we want to

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,839
solve problems on the continent we must

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,559
also be proactive

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,839
about data collection so we build that

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,920
building business

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,280
or building application or data

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,680
collection one of such

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,040
is data crowd we have many of them it

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,000
allows us to be able to use our

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,319
community

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,920
to collect data so if i want to collect

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,240
images of animals

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,440
images of smiling faces you know

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,079
fingerprints

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,760
you know images of shops you know i can

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,720
live like these communities across the

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,880
country

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,240
imagine the community i also make sure

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,480
that they end something

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,720
you know so it's a mutually beneficial

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,520
community so this must be a cultural

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,079
rebuild

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,000
you know we must understand that

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,319
infrastructure do not exist

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,160
if we want to build a database continent

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:49,440
we must also be involved

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,960
in data creation so the old one says oh

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,160
there's no data government is not

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,800
providing data

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,440
we must denied it this is the look and

00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,440
feel

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,200
for our app called data crowd you can

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,720
check it out on android

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,240
i'm glad to say that i know uh uh global

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,280
multinationals are using this

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,920
application

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,839
working with us to help help them to

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,400
track a lot of things on the continent

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,240
uh some critical pull-ups on health and

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,880
we're working on that we also used to

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,359
track

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,640
infrastructure status across the country

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,400
which is helping government to be

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,559
accountable what's the status

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,240
of a project so we get people who take

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,319
pictures and they share it

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,240
so the application takes the coordinates

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,920
and also take the time stamp

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,760
and this gives us a lot of insight and

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
this application is geofence

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,079
so which means it's worked at

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,720
coordinates and launched at last student

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,000
level

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,319
and we've also built another one called

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,599
marketer which allows us to be able to

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,280
collect data

00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,119
on situations and circumstances or

00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,880
seasonalities in various communities

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,880
changes and prices or products

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,119
electricity supply which are critical

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,720
issues popular to africa you know nobody

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,839
will be interested in this data but it's

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,240
critical for us

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,319
to understand the socio-economic nuances

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,280
at the micro market level which helps us

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,440
to solve

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,960
one of the social uh you know

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,720
sustainable development goals

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,640
on hunger and poverty if you do not

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,520
collect this data but not go to no

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,040
communities

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,119
and these are some of the data that were

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,400
quite useful for us in helping the

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,480
country to understand

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,960
the locations to focus on of a

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,760
vulnerable base okay

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,880
uh so as i close i'm going to close on

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,920
what i call the 5s of an african-centric

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,000
uh by corner of pythonista i don't know

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,559
the name you use to describe

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,839
a python user whether it's python or

00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,440
pythonista

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:43,079
uh the otrm is that

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,480
we must be data voice we must be

00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,079
continent-minded

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:51,520
we must be solution oriented and we must

00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,440
be driven towards explanatory outcome

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,599
because that is the only way we can make

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,480
difference on the continent knowing that

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,040
a lot of infrastructure and gaps exist

00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,880
africa

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,440
cannot miss the fourth industrial

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,800
revolution we must all be passionate we

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,800
must be intentional

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,960
we must be definite and deliberate in

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,880
how we leverage the possibilities

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,440
provided by python

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,480
as a tool for programming and two for

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,640
data science

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,319
to be able to create solutions that make

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,200
sense and that is what i'm going to

00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,559
conclude today

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,160
on the 5s of an african-centric person

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,559
who works in this industry

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,760
now for you to make a meaningful impact

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,359
on the continent

00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,599
these five things must shape your

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,160
thinking but shape how you spend your

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,240
day

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,400
must shape how we build our community

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,559
more shape how we engage our community

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,160
must shape how we collectively bring the

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,760
best of ourselves together

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,559
to create solutions that make impact

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,520
number one we must have a scientist

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,640
mindset

00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,000
what's the science mindset i observe i

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,599
hypothesize

00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,400
i i i measure and i find answers to

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,319
problems

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,960
so we must build very strong science

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,000
mindset we must be logic oriented we

00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,680
must not be those

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,920
who are driven by the traditional

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,520
african myth you know this is not an

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,480
african magic we must be science

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,119
oriented

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,880
everything must be provable you must be

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,240
able to observe and prove

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,400
we must not be carried away by

00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,760
sensationalism

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,680
of the continent we must be proactive

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,839
in being interrogated being able to

00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,440
double click and understand what is

00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,359
driving the behavior

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,559
that we see number two you must be a

00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,240
strategist

00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,079
what the strategy does for you you are

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,880
not just getting data points

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,640
as a scientist strategies allows you to

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,720
be able to contextualize

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,920
the scientific mindset all the

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,400
observation

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,760
that you have you can contextualize it

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,160
within the domain of

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,760
broad applications which which is very

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,000
strong in domain knowledge

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,559
which means that it's a medical data i

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,440
strategize by bringing in expertise in

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,319
medicine

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,040
it is agricultural outcome i strategize

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,920
by bringing

00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,119
in farmers to be able to enrich my

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,520
scientific outcome

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,640
you must have a strategy myself what's

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,680
the tragic myself

00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:10,000
in my that brings it all together it

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,559
might say that joins all the dogs

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,160
who make a big decisions do not be a

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,559
data scientist that is not

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,920
that's just driven by the by the

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,599
prediction you have made by your

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,079
position and your recall

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,000
you must be able to bring in the expats

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,960
the main expert in that area

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,680
and act and add what you have with what

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,760
they have

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,880
if they are signed if i did a scientist

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,119
or a

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,880
a python or a practitioner in the

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,119
industry who just rely

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,319
on what comes from your coding uh you

00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,680
are tactical you are

00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,920
you're a tactician you're not a

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,640
strategist your strategies bring it all

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,119
together

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,119
provide context you must also be a

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,480
socializer a socializer

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,280
he saw was a mindset of being on ground

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,040
not just working with the expert he also

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
works with the beneficiary

00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,160
of the model the people upon whom the

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,400
model

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,520
would be applied if he's a farmer he

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,680
goes to the farm

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,880
to feel the pulse of the farmer he

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,760
socializes

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,960
it gets filled inside so that he can

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,680
build a solution

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,200
that works in the real world it's not a

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,760
theoretical sciences

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,040
it's not just an expat strategist that

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,920
work with the expert

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,200
but he's also a socializer that engages

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,040
the beneficiary

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,319
that engages the people upon whom the

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,920
models will be applied

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,640
to understand their nuances their

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,880
language understand the truth upon which

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,160
these can be done of course you must be

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,319
a solution thinker

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,319
a solution thinker brings the lastly

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,559
together the observation and the

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:41,200
diagnostic mindset of a scientist

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
the inclusive thinking of the strategies

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,400
and

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,400
the engaging mindset of a socializer it

00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,559
brings us together to create solutions

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,480
solution that is scientifically valid

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,040
that is strategically inclusive

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,920
and that is socially and engaging to the

00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,319
extent that

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,240
it solves real-world problems that is

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,400
what the solution thinker does

00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,920
you know i'm building a model i'm

00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,040
designing a solution

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,160
i'm being an application that's so real

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,680
problem not just

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,799
a nice paper in nice code you know 200

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,960
line of code

00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,640
clear lines of code excellent but

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,640
doesn't really solve a problem

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,359
does it change the needle does it make

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,760
us a data virus continent does it make

00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,240
us

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,160
use data for decision making does it

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,720
drive data driven innovation

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,480
does it drive product creation that

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,000
drives value for the continent

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,160
and of course everything was come

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,160
together by being a story view that

00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,240
africans are storytellers we love

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,520
stories you know when you are done with

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,559
your solution thinking

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,280
how destroy your not come and tell me

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,839
codes

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,200
tell me story tell me story of inclusion

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,760
tell me story of access

00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,480
to your growth story of wealth story of

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,799
impact

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,520
that is how we must package our final

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,520
outcome

00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,000
do not come to us with quotes we you

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,559
know that behind your work is an amazing

00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
code

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,240
an amazing explanation of how

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,440
people can have access to laws because

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,960
there's not a code

00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,119
that it can be and that can make

00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,599
students ladies and gentlemen

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,359
our python african community it's a

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,240
pleasure to join you this evening

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,960
my name is very clear africa is waiting

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,680
for us

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,119
to make this continent data for us and

00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,839
to make python counts

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,640
in the application we create a solution

00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,079
we develop

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,160
and then how we use data in an

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,839
innovative way we must go into the

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,720
trenches we must build a strong

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,040
community

00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,480
we must encourage young africans to land

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,640
python at this stage

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,880
and that's what we have done in nigeria

00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,200
with the first year book structure

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,960
for beginners we must be proactive in

00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,640
building a dream community not just a

00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,720
learning community we must do

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,240
you must bring community together to do

00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,680
something applied

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,640
you know in an engaging way to solve

00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,079
problems

00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,040
uh within your domain lastly i push very

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,400
strongly

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:01,040
for explainable interpretable you know

00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,000
uh outcomes uh that is driven by

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,559
fairness

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,240
you know uh and responsible practice

00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,559
that i respect the people

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,000
or what can we be you know for whom you

00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,040
know we're going to use that model to

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,680
make a decision

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,280
we must have a sense of respect for the

00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,640
cut off for the for the final

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,920
uh or the final entity or whom the model

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,440
that we're building

00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,599
or the innovation we're creating will be

00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,079
used let's respect them in all that we

00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,880
do

00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,960
our model must not be by us we must be

00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,520
sensitive to those nuances

00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,440
by adopting the fear model and we must

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,880
also be reproducible when your work can

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,200
be reproduced by people

00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,079
so i have the culture of of of sharing

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,240
your work

00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,559
uh you know githubs on different

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,240
platforms so that we can collectively as

00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,160
a continent learn together

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,319
and go together so thank you all for

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,760
having me today it's my special

00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:54,240
uh to be part of pycon africa 2020

00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,359
uh this is bayern kombi from data

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,720
science nigeria

00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,119
if you want to know more about what we

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,520
do you can check us out on our website

00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,720

youtube where you can see a lot of our

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,599
learning videos and a lot of solutions
