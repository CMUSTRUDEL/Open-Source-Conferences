i want to start by thanking the pycon

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
africa organizers for putting on this

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
event

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
there's a lot of fantastic work being

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
done

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
in the python african community and i'm

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,439
really honored to be a part of this

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,320
event

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,360

with everybody

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
in the african community as well as the

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
python community around the world

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
and also thanks to everybody out there

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,640

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
which is

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,879
in the midwest of the us uh they call

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,119
chicago the third coast we have uh we're

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,640
on the coast of lake michigan

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,320
uh i've been here since 2008 and uh

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
before i was from canada but i love

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,000
chicago it's uh it's my

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,159
home uh in chicago i help organize the

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,680
chicago python users group

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,000
we call ourselves chippy

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
uh and i'm gonna tell you a story about

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
a community engagement initiative we've

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,360
been working on

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
for the past year called busy beaver

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
but i'm starting to get a little bit

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
ahead of myself

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
the chicago python users group was

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,360
founded back in 2003 where one of the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,840
og python communities we've grown from a

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,759
small group of python enthusiasts

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
to becoming one of the largest python

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,320
communities in the world

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,240
we have 6 000 members on meetup and

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
every month we usually have three to

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,200
five events

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,000
in addition to our dunder maine meeting

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
which happens

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
on the second tuesday of every single

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,280
month

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,479
we have special interest groups that

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
focus in on

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,319
more niche applications of python

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,000
a majority of our community uses python

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
for data science i think that's pretty

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
much

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
true for communities across the world

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
also we have a special interest group

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
devoted to

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,400
data science data engineering data

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,520
analysis

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,720
machine learning there's also

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
a group for web dev devops this one's my

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,879
favorite

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,239
since the discipline of software

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,040
engineering it's a little bit more

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
mature

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
we have an eclectic mix of talks uh

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
we've had talks about grpc with

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,959
protobufs

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
about devops best practices uh the

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
speaker used simpsons meme so that was

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
that was a lot of fun

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
and uh our last event had a talk about

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
migrating

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,879
a bot from node.js to go it's not really

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
a python topic but these kinds of things

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,160
they come up in software engineering we

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,360
can like use them to maybe

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
migrate from python to python 3.

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
chicago is also one of the biggest

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
finance hubs in the world and we have

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
pythonistas in treating shops all over

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
the city

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
and we also have a sig devoted to it and

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,720
for folks that can't make

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
our evening events we have the python

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,080
lunch break

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
and this event happens once a month and

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
it's during lunch and it's usually

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
hosted

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
in the downtown chicago offices of one

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
of our sponsors

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
it's by far our smallest event there's

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,159
usually only like 20 people

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,080
that uh that can attend but i find it

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,040
one of our closely net like one of the

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,000
best uh discussions we have

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
we also have a monthly special interest

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
group devoted to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
algorithms and data structures in this

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
event

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
we have uh two to three problems that we

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
take from a site like

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,440
leak code or hacker rank and then folks

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,120
break up into small groups and work on

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,360
these problems together

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
and at the end we select groups to

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
present a solution to each of their

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,840
problems

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
we also hold a monthly project night and

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,480
so this project uh night has two tracks

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,799
we have a group of project night track

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,239
where uh teams of four people

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,159
mob program on a challenge

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
that one of our organizers has uh

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,120
created and

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
our second track it's a little bit less

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,440
formal it's the bring your own project

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,720
track and here people just bring their

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
side projects

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
and uh work around like a room together

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
and we have folks wandering

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
uh providing help as they can the

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
picture

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
on the right that's of naomi cedar naomi

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,440
was the last chairperson

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,280
of the psf naomi's from chicago and

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
we're proud to have her as a member of

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
our community

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
and all of this is just really to say

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
that we're fortunate to have a very

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
active community of pythonistas in

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
chicago

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
and like most organizations chicago

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,639
python

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
we use the slack we have a slack

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479
workspace and this platform

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
it's become more ingrained in our

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,600
community over the past few

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,320
years the past few months to years

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,800
our workspace currently has 1900 plus

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,800
members i think the last count was 1952.

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
uh we have over hundred and seventy

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,759
thousand total messages set that's

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,639
that's just amazing a lot of friendships

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
happen on slack and currently we have

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,880
around 150

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
weekly active users before covet 19

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
happened

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,320
it was averaging around 250 to 300 it's

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
definitely understandable that people

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
are engaging

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
uh with other things in their lives

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
besides the python community

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,440
in our workspace we have lots of

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
different channels for more focused

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,840
conversations

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,639
some of my favorites include things like

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,560
book club we have one for advent of code

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
and pets of chippy that's always a lot

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,039
of fun people just share pictures of

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,560
their pets

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
i also wanted to give a shout out to our

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
pycon channel we were fortunate to have

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,840
a pretty sizable contingent of

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,880
chicago folks at pycon us's over the

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,639
past few years

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
and we use this channel as a way to

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
coordinate activities

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
uh at the conference uh but this year

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,280
with uh

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,880
uh pycon us moving becoming more of a

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
becoming a virtual conference

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
we've been using this room uh as a way

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,560
to share

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,759
talks that have been posted over the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
past few uh

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
i think they posted them over like five

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,800
or six waves and so we've been able to

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,319
showcase what's going on

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,479
and we've been able to spotlight some

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,680
folks in our community that had a chance

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,680
to speak at pycon

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,400
and so slack it's fantastic there's a

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
huge ecosystem of plugins in their

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
application directory

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,360
we do use a lot of these plugins

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,759
extensively

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
but as organizers of a tech focused

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
community

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
we have a different set of problems that

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,800
we're trying to solve we're trying to

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
build the community

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,919
we're trying to foster conversations

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
around python

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
we want to keep people informed what's

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,080
happening in our local community

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,840
as well as the wider python ecosystem we

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
want to provide folks value

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:03,840
so people keep coming back and engaging

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,840
and participating on this platform

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
nothing out there really fit our

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
specific use case so we needed to design

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,400
a custom solution

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,319
we put together a team and we let them

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,800
loose on this problem

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
and after a lot of hard work and just a

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
little bit of design

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,479
the end result is busy beaver and this

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
is a slack bot that was built

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,000
specifically for the chicago python

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
workspace

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
and this bot's mission statement is to

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
increase engagement

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,440
within our chicago python community but

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,759
that's a pretty broad scope

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,199
what does this really mean so let's talk

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
about some of the ways that we're

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,000
increasing community engagement

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,759
in order to make it easier for folks to

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
find out when our upcoming events are

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
happening

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:51,919
we've integrated chippy's event calendar

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,319
into our bot so users can use the slash

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,280
busy beaver next command to find out

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,360
when our next event is happening

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
and there's also a slash busy beaver

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,919
events command

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,639
that shows a list of our upcoming events

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,039
we've also set up a cron job that to

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,280
have busy fever post this list

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,960
to our announcements channel at 9 00 a.m

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
every monday morning

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
and our slack workspace it's been set to

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
add new users

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
to this announcements channel so we

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,039
really automated a lot of our work that

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,800
goes into event marketing

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,479
busy beaver currently integrates with

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
the meetup api

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,120
every night we have a cron job that runs

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,320
that syncs our bot's local calendar

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,479
with the calendar on meetup and chippy

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
uses meetup to advertise all of our

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,039
events

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
so this is currently the only platform

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
we're supporting but the way business

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,919
people have been designed we can easily

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,959
integrate another platform

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
like eventbrite another way that

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,240
busybeaver engages our community

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,480
is through the our retweeter feature

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
the chicago python twitter account

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
shares a lot of content related to

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
what's happening

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
in both our local community as well as

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,440
the larger python ecosystem

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
we're going to share things like calls

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,120
for proposals upcoming conferences and

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,320
virtual events

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
releases of python or of major packages

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,959
like

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,080
pi test or pandas but not everybody on

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,160
our slack follows us on twitter so the

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
busy beaver team went out and

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
implemented a feature that's going to

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
share tweets made by the at chicago

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
python twitter account

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
in a designated channel and we just call

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,560
that channel at chicago python

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
and we also just ask set this channel to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
be

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
one of the auto ad channels for new

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
users

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
and it's really helped to increase the

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,880
reach of our social media platform

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,519
i think we have 500 of our 2000 folks in

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,800
this uh

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,959
chicago python channel and the last

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
busy busy favorite feature i want to

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,680
highlight is

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
really the original reason we started

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,440
the bot

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,640
github we all know it it's a social

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,600
coding platform

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,880
lots of developers in chicago and of

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
course around the world

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,480
use github to store their code and to

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
interact with projects

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
and with other developers a majority of

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
members

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
in chicago python have github accounts

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
but as a community and as an

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,720
organization

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
we really didn't have a lot of insights

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
into projects other people are working

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
on

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,720
to the repositories that they're

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
starring into open source projects

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,360
that they're contributing to by

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,760
providing insight into people's

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,480
public github activity we hoped we could

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,480
increase our user engagement

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
so users can go out and register with

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
our bot using the slash

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,160
busy beaver connect command and it's

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,440
going to send you a private message

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,120
that's going to ask you to link your

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,920
slack account and you're going to be

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,920
taken to

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,079
a github page where you can authorize

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,560
busy beaver to identify you

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,440
and read your public information and

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
then every day

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
at 2 pm chicago time busy beaver goes

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,279
out

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,279
it scrapes that github api to find all

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,800
of the activity for our registered users

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,880
for that past day

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,440
and it compiles a summary and i post

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,680
that to the busy beaver channel

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,320
on our slack let's talk about how do we

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:15,839
go about

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,839
making busy beaver

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
this is a picture of myself and chris

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
litki

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,440
chris was my mentee in the chicago

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,160
python mentorship program

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
and after our formal mentorship was over

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,800
we were looking to work on a project

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
together

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,120
and one of the ideas we had was to build

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,480
a slack bot so we can share activity

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,120
to see what folks in our community are

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,200
working on so we decided to spend the

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
weekend oh spend the weekend hacking on

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
this project

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
at our local coffee shop shout out to

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,480
dollop coffee

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,880
uh chris was looking into different ways

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,760
that we can use the github api

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,320
to compute some useful statistics he

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,720
also took ownership of the slack feature

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,079
he wanted to uh so his job was to figure

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
out how to send messages

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,560
and more importantly how to send emojis

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
in those messages

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
i spent a lot of time making busy beaver

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
into a proper project

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,560
we set up a reproducible development

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
environment uh we incorporated sql

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
alchemy as our orm

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
added migrations uh we added tests we

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
want to make sure that the things that

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,680
we were doing didn't break existing

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
functionality and that they also worked

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
as intended

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,440
and i built out a ci pipeline to ensure

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
that before we merge any code

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,360
we have a sense of the quality and if it

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,279
passes all of our tests

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
by sunday night we had something that

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,160
resembled like a real python project

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
after a little bit of polishing we were

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,639
ready to soft launch busy beaver

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
uh to our test users this gave us a

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,279
chance to iron out all of our issues

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,920
before we actually went out and released

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,399
to our wide republic

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
and doing this it was a great idea since

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,800
we learned a few things and we found

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
some issues

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
one of our test users he only had a

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,000
single page

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,760
of a get of a a public github activity

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
and uh we didn't account for that edge

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,040
case and we also had a datetime.now

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
at module level instead of scoped at

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
function level this meant that we were

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,839
publishing

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
aggregate statistics versus statistics

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
for the last day

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
and these are the types of issues we

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,240
really wanted to figure out

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,920
and that's exactly why we had beta users

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
so after fixing some bugs

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,079
we were ready to release busy beaver uh

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
we announced busy beaver

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,880
at uh the chippy main meeting back in i

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,360
believe it was january 2019.

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,639
yeah it's been a while uh this project

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
it was received with a lot of great

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,839
fanfare but i have a very biased opinion

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
folks came up to me and chris afterwards

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
and they started talking about different

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
ways that we can make busy beaver

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,440
into more of a community engagement bot

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,240
all the pieces were there

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,760
we just had to put the work in so i

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,760
spent some time developing

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
project product management skills as

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,480
well as project management skills

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,880
and we created a product roadmap so we

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
used

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
uh we created a bunch of issues on our

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
github issue tracker

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
started adding tags for things that we

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,519
needed help on

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
things that were good for first-time

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,839
contributors

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,600
on top of chippy community members

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
making prs to this bot

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,199
uh we also i ended up going to a lot of

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,519
conferences last year

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,720
and i found new contributors during open

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
source sprint sessions

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480
and so some conferences after the talks

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,360
portions are over

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
they have uh open source sprints where

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
project maintainers can find new

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
contributors

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,600
and this is a really great way to get uh

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,040
to get involved in open source

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,160
uh since project maintainers are gonna

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,199
be there to help you set up a

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
development environment

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,320
as well as to answer any questions that

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
might come up

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
sometimes it's not as like i think

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,240
meeting in person might be a little bit

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,440
better than meeting online like it adds

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,120
that extra dimension

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
and so this is the picture on the left

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,519
of uh the busy beaver team

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,680
at pycon us last year and on the right

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,279
it's uh my friend cody and i

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,920
at pie cascades uh last year

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,480
and one of the contributors of busy

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
beaver

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,560
is the organizer of python belgrade

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
shout out to boyan

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
uh he expressed some some interest in

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,279
having this github

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,120
summary feature in their slack workspace

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,720
instead of actually taking a step back

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,639
and doing things properly

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
we just hacked together a solution to

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
get it in front of more people

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,000
and unsurprisingly this bot did not

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480
engage their community

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the way it did our community in fact

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
people thought it was spam

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
they thought it was like uh a blockchain

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
enthusiast just annoying everybody

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
we were so focused on getting into other

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
workspaces but we really forgot to

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
consider

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,360
rollout and onboarding strategy i want

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
to talk a little bit more about this in

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,880
the retrospective

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,160
but we did learn an important lesson

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
going from one user

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
to two users it's not just a technical

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
challenge

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
we need to ensure that the product we're

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,199
building is something that our customers

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,199
actually want so let's just change some

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:09,839
gears and talk about the busy beaver

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:11,600
tech stack

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,360
so first we need to understand what kind

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
of workflows do we have inside this

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
application

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,959
most of our workflows are related to

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,399
slack so the slack api is going to send

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
an ap it's going to send a request to

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,959
busy beaver

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
this could be triggered with a slash

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,279
command or

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,920
triggered through an event subscription

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,360
and depending on what the event is busy

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,720
beaver's gonna have to do some work

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
it's probably gonna have to interact

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
with our database uh

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,160
and it's gonna at the end it's gonna

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,000
send back a response to slack

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,440
we also have a few workflows as i

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
mentioned that are triggered by cron

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,279
jobs

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,759
sort of just periodic jobs and so cron's

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
gonna kick off a busy beaver task

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
busy beaver is going to probably go out

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,440
to our database get some information

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
and then interact with a third-party

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,519
integration depending on

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
what the task is and also depending on

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,480
what the task is

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,319
we might post something to slack

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,720
with the context of how this app works

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,880
at a high level let's take a look at our

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
back-end architecture

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,199
busy beaver is unsurprisingly a python

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,480
web application we uh we use the flask

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
framework for this

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
this currently sits behind our engine x

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,679
server or nginx

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,360
pod which uh acts as our load balancer

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
and a reverse proxy

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,080
and our web application is going to get

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,720
requests from integration callbacks

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,760
as well as from our front end and

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
they're just going to be going through

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
nginx and passed

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,000
through our flask application and our

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
web app

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
it can also be triggered using

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,480
management commands from the command

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
line

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
and for long long-running processes and

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,280
for long-running tasks

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,520
we have set up uh async workers using rq

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,840
and this is going to pick up tasks off

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
of our redis cube

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,480
and our web application it's going to

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
enqueue onto tasks on this queue to run

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,200
either immediately or we can schedule

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,720
them to run at a later date

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
so let's briefly talk about our

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,679
deployment busy beaver is

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
a cloud native application that's been

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,600
developed using the

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
12 factor application methodology when

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
we first created this app

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
the fastest way to get in front of users

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
was to spin up a couple of docker

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,919
containers so that's exactly what we did

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,240
we deployed to prod using docker compose

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
but as the project grew our hacked

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
together

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960
uh web app and our deployment pipeline

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,000
it was starting to become

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,400
a little bit more unmanageable i took

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,640
some time over the past few months

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
to migrate the app to kubernetes and it

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
really just gave me the opportunity to

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
learn a new technology that i really

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,880
wanted

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,760
i wanted to play around with currently

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
our deployment

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,559
is managed our role has been managed by

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,960
helm we've templated out all of our

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,880
kubernetes manifests for different

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
environments and so currently we only

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
have a production environment running

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,320
but if we really want to test staging

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,840
we could just spin up another busy

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,799
beaver and point to

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,799
our staging slack

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,919
our deployments or uh to production are

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,400
triggered using github actions

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
and we used a managed post resolution

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,320
for our relational backend

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
so backups and recoveries it's all taken

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,480
care of i don't really mind paying some

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
money

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,400
for somebody else to have to worry about

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
that instead of me

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
my favorite part of agile is i think the

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
retrospective

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,039
i i believe in open and honest retros

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
after pretty much every sprint and every

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
feature release the only way to get

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,280
better is to analyze what you did before

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
so i thought it'd be a useful exercise

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,799
to conduct a project retrospective with

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,799
everybody here

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,559
so let's start by talking about what

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
went well

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,320
starting this project with a hackathon

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,559
was a really good idea

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
we had clearly defined goals on what we

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,799
wanted to build

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,600
and that's exactly what we did bringing

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,120
in beta testers was helpful in finding

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,360
edge cases

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,039
and building out a rudimentary

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,240
continuous integration continuous

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
delivery pipeline

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,360
it allowed us to iterate quickly when we

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,440
found a bug

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
we can easily fix it and then ship it

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,559
off into production

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,919
and i don't think any talk about devops

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,559
or anything would be

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
uh talk without this specific diagram so

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,679
i had to include that

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,799
and i also like this saying make it work

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
make it right

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,480
make it fast this is a quote by uh kent

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,440
beck and when we were first building

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
this slackbot

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
we built out a proof of concept script

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
it wasn't even an application

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
we wanted to get this script in front of

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,120
people as soon as possible

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,400
there's really no point spending time

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,760
building something people

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,840
don't want next let's talk about what

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,840
did not go well

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
so when we first started building this

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,080
project we didn't really have an

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,840
overarching plan of what we wanted to do

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,400
we were trying to solve our specific

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
problem

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
and that's exactly what we did and then

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,400
the bot grew organically from there

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
the end result it's a little bit of a

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,919
mess

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,760
and also i'd say some of this is

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,000
attributed to me i didn't really make

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,000
the

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,520
best technical decisions when i was

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
first designing the solution

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
this project originally used the

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,600
responder web framework which is built

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,760
on top of startlit

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,159
and uh i really had to go out and

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,559
implement a lot of functionality myself

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,520
since i didn't have the tools that the

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,559
ecosystem

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,000
of a flask or a jenga would provide we

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,919
also used sql light

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,840
to get this idea out the door we

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,799
eventually did migrate to flask

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,520
and to postgres but this tip did take

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,640
some time

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,480
and it took away from some feature work

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,880
we also we didn't know how to use our

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,320
tools in the most optimal way

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
this was my first time building a

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
slackbot this was chris's first time

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,679
building a slackbot

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,440
we really didn't do enough uh research

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
into how different slack integrations

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
work

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,000
what that user experience is like this

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,760
has really been a learning process

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and i would say that we're light years

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
ahead of where we are but of course

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,080
we're always still learning and always

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
trying to get better

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,960
and at the end of the day like we're

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
building a slack thought does this

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,120
project

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,799
need kubernetes probably not i may have

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,679
spent some time over engineering the

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,760
solution

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,280
but at the same time like this is this

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
is like i mean this is a very valid

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
critique like i would not do this at

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
work

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,520
but i did want to have fun with this

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,400
project and it gave me a chance to learn

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,679
a technology

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
i've been wanting to play around with

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
for a few years

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,480
so let's talk about things that we can

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,679
improve going forward as a project

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
most of the community related

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,919
interactions for busy beaver they've

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
fallen

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,520
under either chicago python or at a

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,679
conference so we've had

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
other code of conducts that govern our

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
activity for uh for our sprints and

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
things like that

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,840
fortunately we've not really had an

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
incident at this moment but as this

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,159
project grows in scope and size

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
we need to start defining what code of

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,159
conduct means for disney bieber

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
i have an issue currently open on the

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,600
issue tracker and i need to do a little

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,280
bit more research and get more

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,880
well-versed in what this means

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,919
and i hope to have that done in the next

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,159
few weeks to months

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,760
we also definitely need to improve our

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,679
product management skills

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,360
we always have to start taking a step

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,000
back to make sure that what we're

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,200
building

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,080
is actually what users want this is the

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,320
very famous

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,840
product management venn diagram or that

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,840
you see pretty much everywhere

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,679
i might have i modified it a little bit

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
to fit busy beavers mission statement of

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,360
community

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,400
by hacking things together and figuring

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
out how they like

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,799
just figuring out how things work we're

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,120
able to solve problems in chicago

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,320
but as we learn going to for going from

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,559
one to two

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
it's pretty difficult and one of the

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,480
things that we're currently working on

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,320
is improving our onboarding experience

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
and this is both onboarding for new

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
users and new workspaces

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,799
as well as for new contributors this is

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,200
by far our highest priority

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
because at the end of the day we want

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,919
busy beaver

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,919
to be used by tech focused communities

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,320
around the world we're all solving

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
sort of similar problems why spend time

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
reinventing the wheel

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,159
so this leads me to our announcement

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,960
over the past few weeks we've been

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,960
working

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,520
on making busy beaver from a single

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,600
tenant to a multi-tenant application so

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,120
it could be used by other user groups

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,440
so if you're interested in installing

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
busy beaver you can go to our github

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,559
page

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,279
hit the add to slack button uh once it's

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
installed

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,559
workspace admins can go and edit our

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
settings

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,600
you can automate engagement specifically

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,919
for your community

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,200
and this could be enabling or disabling

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,200
certain types of features

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,039
so you can customize busy beaver to work

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
for your community the way you want it

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,640
to work

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,480
for links on how to install busy beaver

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
check out our github page

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,679
give it a star while you're at it we'd

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,200
really appreciate it

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,840
and before i close out i sort of just

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,840
want to talk about the future of busy

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
beaver

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,440
currently not all of our features are

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,240
multi-tenant there is still some work to

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
do

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,960
it's probably gonna take like an

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,720
afternoon or maybe up to a weekend to

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
get them all there

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
are currently as i mentioned our

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
onboarding workflow it's not the best

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,200
it's a little crude

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,840
and it lacks polish this definitely

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,760
needs to be something that we improve

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
so i've been starting to document a lot

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,960
of the tasks that are going to make busy

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
beaver into more of a polished product

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,679
on

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,559
our issue tracker if you're interested

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,039
in contributing

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,120
i recommend checking out our readme you

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,000
give a shout out to johnny out in

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,640
toronto he wrote up our fantastic

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,640
contribution docs

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,039
i really hope this story of how chicago

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,039
python automated community engagement

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,039
it helps other communities out there

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,240
because we all have similar goals and

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,640
similar missions

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
let's pool our resources and achieve a

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
lot more together

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
i want to thank all the members of the

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,240
busy beaver team

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,760
for all their hard work thanks everybody

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,200
out there for your time

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,600
i also do want to give a shout out to

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,279
chicago python i would not be where i am

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,760
as a developer without that fantastic

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
organization and i sort of just didn't

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
really talk about how we've been

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,279
handling tobits i just wanted to

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
make a note at the end with the pandemic

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,960
we've not been able to do

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,320
all like in-person events at all i think

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,080
that's going to be true pretty much

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
going into next year

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
but we have been engaging our local

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,840
community uh by live streaming events

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
onto our youtube channel

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,360
um since our events are virtual we've

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
been able to feature speakers from

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,039
around america we've had one from uh

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
from croatia so yeah that's been a

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
really great way to

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
connect with the python community as a

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,200
whole if there i guess there is a silver

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
lining to what's happened

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
and also when i just posted a link to

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,840
these slides i got this reply

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
uh we should be talking about sister

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,799
cities concepts

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,480
uh between communities and i think

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
that's a fantastic idea

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,080
so if anybody like to chat about that

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and things like that please reach out

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,279
again my name is ali simsji and thanks

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,840
so much for your time

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,840
