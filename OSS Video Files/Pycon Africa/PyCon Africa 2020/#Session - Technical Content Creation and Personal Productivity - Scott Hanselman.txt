we're live hey friends

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
how's it going i'm scott hanselman and

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,880
i'm so

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
incredibly happy to be here today to

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,119
spend some time with you

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,920
i wish that i could be somewhere on the

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,080
continent

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,679
in person but of course since we're all

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,880
virtual right now

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,680
that's not possible but i do have my

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,480
zimbabwean flag representing my wife's

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
family and i wish that i could get back

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
that side sometime soon i'm thrilled

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
that we have people

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
from all over the world spending time

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
with us today

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,879
on this wonderful virtual event and i

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,520
thank

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
marlene and all the organizers for all

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
of their hard work i hope you appreciate

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
them as well

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
i want to talk about a couple of things

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
this is actually kind of two

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,119
talks that have been combined together

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
one talk was about personal productivity

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,280
and one was about being a social

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,799
developer so i kind of combined them

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
because i think that there's a lot of

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,680
pressure right now to be out there on

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,759
the internet

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
and produce lots of content and we're

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
always talking about

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,600
hustle culture and things like that

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
and i want to talk about where i think

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
parts of that are a problem

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,439
and why i think uh there's an

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,400
opportunity for us to be our best

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,680
selves online now i made these horrible

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
slides

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
just to give you an example of how easy

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
it is you can kind of make things a

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
little bit nicer this is

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
comic sans and i'm told that you're not

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,720
supposed to do that if you're going to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
be a good

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,799
content creator so if you have some

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
slides like this which is just

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
you know text on a background give it a

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
nice little font

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
makes it look more official makes it

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
look more cool

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,560
then you just add some free stock

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,119
photography

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
suddenly everything looks so much nicer

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
and maybe you give it a nice

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,479
instagram filter and you look like a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
million bucks

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
and that right there off the bat makes

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,840
me look like an official

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
conference speaker and it looks so much

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
nicer than my first

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
my first slide there it's the little

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
things like that takes a little amount

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
of work

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
but it makes for a really nice situation

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,879
and again

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
i wish i was there for you all in person

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,760
i wish that we were all together in the

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
hallway track

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,080
spending time together but we can't

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
now for those of you who don't know me

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
i'm scott hanselman and i work for

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
microsoft but i've worked in open source

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
for many many years

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
in fact i've been in software for almost

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
30 years

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
and when i was in open source a number

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,040
of years ago

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,120
and i went to work at microsoft a lot of

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,879
people said that i was a sellout

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,040
they're like oh man you just went there

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,720
for the money why'd you do that why'd

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,360
you leave us an open source

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
and i have to say it made me feel a

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
little bit

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,760
sad made me feel bad but somehow

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
i was able to work through those those

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
issues working for

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
working for the company here's a picture

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
of me before

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,200
microsoft and here's a picture of me

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,400
after microsoft

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,040
and it worked out pretty okay

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
but seriously though everyone wants to

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
try to be a

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
success in software and open source

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
online and it can be a little bit

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
stressful

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
and even though i've been doing this for

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,080
many many years i want to say out loud

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
and make sure that we say this to our

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,560
ourselves and we say this to our friends

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,760
that we are really all amateurs

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,040
it doesn't matter if you've been doing

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,599
software for 4 years or 40 years

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
software moves so fast and changes so

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,239
much

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
that virtually everything that i learned

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
in my degree

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
is useless now some of the theory was

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
great but all the languages that i

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,840
learned are dead

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
so if we remember that as we are a

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,360
community that we're all amateurs

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,760
and that there's really no professionals

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
we're just learning and growing together

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
and we all make

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
mistakes

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,199
i see that we see lei is saying he

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,799
didn't see the before and after pictures

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,199
did you see that before this is me

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,600
before

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
and me after i think it looks a little

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,759
bit like me

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:33,440
with without a without a gray beard

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
we make mistakes and we're all that kind

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
of

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
we all make these mistakes and it's very

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
common to do these things and it's

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
important to remember that when we're

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
producing content because a lot of times

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,759
people feel

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
stressed out like you are a community

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,639
member

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,360
maybe you're a community leader and you

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,280
need to be

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
the best you need to be the one that

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,080
knows everything

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
and i think we need to normalize the

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,160
fact that we don't know everything

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
that we're not experts we're not leaders

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
in the sense that

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
i know it all and i should tell you

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,000
everything about how these technologies

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,520
work

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,039
i think that uh css

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
is a really good example let me make

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,240
sure that can

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
folks see my screen because i'm hearing

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
in the chat

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
that there might be an issue with slides

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
because i'm showing some fun things and

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
people are maybe not seeing it so let's

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
take a look for just a moment

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
and we'll check on that from a tech

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
support perspective

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,440
it's a good idea to double check maybe

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,320
marlene can

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,120
let me know if people can see my shared

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
slides or not

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
just to make sure because the slides are

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
part of the experience

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
aren't they

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,039
all right we can see the slides so you

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
see lebron right now my friends

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
okay great i'll slow down a little bit

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,360
fantastic

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
so i was saying about how important it

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,039
is to remember that we're not

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
experts and if we look at something like

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,720
css

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,199
which is really more complicated than

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,240
you realize

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,880
someone says that css is so expressive

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,280
and so obvious and so easy to understand

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,319
but this is how i feel when i'm using

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,479
css

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,000
and when i see experts out there talking

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
about it i wonder

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
how are they able to possibly understand

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
that

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960
another great example is languages like

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
javascript

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
right i know this is a python conference

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
but we find ourselves learning

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
javascript

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
to do our jobs this is me learning

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,120
javascript

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,560
for the first time it can be really

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,479
stressful to be told

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
that you have to be an expert in a

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,039
certain technology if you want to be

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
successful and i think one of the great

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
things to remember of course when you

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
think about a language like javascript

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
is that you don't need to learn the bad

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
parts

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,039
because there's just so so many bad

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
parts

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,400
now when i say that we're all amateurs i

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
think we need to be humble

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
when we're creating content and if you

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,319
look at someone like

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,360
tim berners-lee tim berners-lee

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,520
invented the world wide web he's in fact

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
sir tim berners-lee because he was

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
knighted

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
by the queen and i think it was

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
interesting because

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
so many people out there want to have

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,840
senior engineer

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,840
by their by their titles

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
so many people want to have a senior web

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
developer

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
or principal web developer if you look

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,759
at someone like tim berners-lee

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,160
who invented the web himself

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
notice that he did not put senior by his

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,319
name

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,039
he didn't even put the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
imagine what a flex that would be if tim

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,560
berners-lee said

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
title the web developer you meet him at

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
a conference

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,440
you say hey how's it going are you a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
senior web developer

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,199
and he says no i'm the web developer i

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
made it that was me

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
he didn't know he didn't know when he

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,520
invented the the web that it would

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
become this

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
amazing thing that we're all using and

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
that we're using to make applications

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
it's one of those things that you start

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,919
when you create something

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
and you don't know how far it's going to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
go you don't expect that it's going to

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,080
become as big as it is and that's the

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,879
way it is with all technologies

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,360
that we create any open source project

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,880
that you

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,399
start with could become something huge

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,080
and you'll never know you won't know

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,360
someone will say did you have a plan and

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
you'll say i didn't have a plan i was

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
just trying to build something

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,640
special and exciting i think another

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,920
good example is something like adobe pdf

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,519
no one would have expected that a pdf

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,320
would become the fifth

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,519
most popular religion that people want

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,279
to convert to

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,640
this is my google search when i want to

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,240
convert to something

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,399
and it looks like you can convert to all

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
these religions and also to pdf

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,519
now i've been writing code for a very

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,399
very long time i wrote some code

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,600
in c plus plus in the early early 90s

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
some of you

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
may be old enough to remember this but

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,279
this was how windows looked before

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,880
there were actual windows

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
and one of the things that i think is

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
worth pointing out

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
is when people are out there talking

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,880
about how many years

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,880
experience they have you have to ask

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,200
yourself

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200
do you have 20 years experience

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,320
or do you have the same years experience

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,120
20 times

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
and by that i mean you have to be

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,399
intentional

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
you have to be deliberate in your

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
practice

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
deliberate practice is a really really

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,880
important thing

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
you you may have met people like this

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,959
you may meet them in the community

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
you may meet them at work and someone

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
says yeah i've been

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,680
i've been working for 20 years yeah i've

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,800
got 20 years experience

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
but are they learning each year are they

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
growing

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,800
each year are they trying new things

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,079
each year

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,279
are they stretching each year

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,920
this is a process of being intentional

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,120
about your

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,160
career about your learning about how you

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
decide to be you could be old

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,399
but that doesn't mean that you know

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,079
everything and if it's just the same

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,279
year the same mistakes

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,279
over and over for 20 years

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,440
then you're not really growing so

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,320
there's an opportunity for us as

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,000
as digital natives as people who are on

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
the internet people who are born on the

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
internet

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,160
to really grow by writing by sharing

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
by being a community by going to

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
conferences like this

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
and that's going to let us really have

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,519
new experiences

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,640
and new years as we go forward in life

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,880
now i do this by writing a lot i've been

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,839
writing a ton i've been writing on my

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
blog

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
for about 18 or 19 years and i write

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,399
about

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,480
being a phony feeling like i have

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
impostor syndrome

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,320
i've written about my opinions on

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,519
different pieces of software

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,160
i build things in my garage

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,279
in my garage so here i've built a video

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,200
arcade

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,000
i've even blogged about my garden

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
square foot gardening everybody needs a

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
garden

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
i've written a bunch of phone apps for

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,079
dead

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
phones that no one uses anymore like the

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,360
windows phone

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
i even wrote a blood sugar management

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
system

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,120
for diabetics on the palm pilot

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,240
in the early 90s and also my son

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
who is now 15 i wrote a game for him

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,320
called

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
baby smash at babysmash.com it's still

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
out there

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
great for kids lets them smash on the

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,480
keyboard

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,160
i've written a bunch of books that are

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,519
not really very good you shouldn't

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,279
check them out um i've got a couple of

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
podcasts

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,160
i've written about being a better

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,399
speaker so why am i doing this

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,839
i'm doing it because i want to put out

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,560
any learning

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
that i'm doing out into the world so i

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
can hopefully make the world a better

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,880
place

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
but it's important to note that i'm not

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,000
doing it because i think i know

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,680
everything

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,360
what i'm doing and what i would

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,560
encourage you to do

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,160
is to learn in public there's too many

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
people out there that are acting like

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,160
they're experts

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
and those experts talk down to us and

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,120
they have the knowledge

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
and we're here we go tell us the

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,079
knowledge i'm an expert

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,680
what i want to do is i want a level

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
playing field where we learn

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
in public together and we make a

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,880
community

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,560
where people are able to share

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,680
without fear of being yelled at if they

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
make a mistake

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,160
because if you can learn in public you

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,560
make a mistake and you gently correct it

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,519
and then you learn and you put out new

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,519
content

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
then everyone is going to be able to

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,279
grow and then we're not

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
at the mercy of all of the experts to

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,839
tell us

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,200
how things need to be so this involves a

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
number of skills

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,480
that are not technical skills these are

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,000
more

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,360
human skills and i kind of break them

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
down in the terms of

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,320
your career skills the term marketing

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,600
yourself you might hear the word

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,839
personal brand i'm not a big fan of that

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,560
myself but marketing yourself really

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,639
means being intentional about

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
about who you are and then deciding how

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,440
you're going to learn and if you're

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,959
going to learn in public

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
and in order to do all of this you need

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,240
to be somewhat productive

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,399
and i'll talk to you about some of my

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,600
philosophies around productivity

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
in just a moment but i mentioned earlier

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
about feeling like an imposter this is

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,040
really common

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:12,079
in the software space being an imposter

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,040
is that sense that i i think i know what

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
i'm doing

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,399
but maybe people are going to figure out

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,880
that i don't really

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
like i shouldn't have this job and i i'm

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
only like one chapter ahead

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
and i don't really understand i'm just

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,639
really a good googler i'm not really a

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
developer i'm just a really good googler

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,079
and that feeling of imposter syndrome

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,880
can be really overwhelming

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,000
i worked with a friend of mine named rob

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,600
connery and

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,680
we put together a book called the

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,639
imposters handbook

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
and this is a great book for self-taught

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
developers

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
for people who maybe know how to code

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,839
but don't have a big background in

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
computer science

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,519
that's something to think about is there

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,240
anything that you can do to fill in the

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
gaps

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
of your knowledge that make you feel

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,920
more like you belong

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,320
in the community because i feel like all

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,160
of us do belong

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
i've also put out a lot of free content

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,320
this is a great little

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
movie it's a feature length production i

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,600
think it's about an hour and a half or

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
two hours long it's a movie that we made

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,920
called get involved in tech we put it

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,600
out on pluralsight

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
and it's free you do not need a

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
pluralsight subscription

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
to watch this movie and in that movie we

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
talk about blogging and twitter and

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,320
github and stack overflow and user

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,240
groups and

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,519
conferences and all the things that can

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
make you a happier

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,399
and more productive developer so

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,000
if you start getting involved in tech

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,120
like i know all of you

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,560
are this is a really uh

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
a really good question and we've got a

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
question in the in the comments there

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,399
that i'll mention as well

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,480
when you're starting out in tech there's

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,000
an overwhelming

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,040
um pressure to do all of these things

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,040
look at that list one of the things

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,079
that's interesting about that list

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,480
is that coding

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,759
isn't on that list like i thought i was

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
going to be programming things i thought

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,279
i was going to be making

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
do i have to blog and tweet and do stack

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
overflow and user groups and be a

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
community organizer

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,480
i think it's really important for us to

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,800
realize that to be a successful

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,800
tech person a successful programmer you

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,800
don't need to do all of those things

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
you should only do the ones that feed

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,959
your spirit

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,320
that make you happy and that move you

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,160
forward

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
maybe you do just blogging maybe you

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,839
don't do any of these things maybe you

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,240
just do twitter

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,279
another great question here from ahmed

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
in the

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,120
in the chat was about if you share a new

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,639
thing that you learn

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,600
should you repeat it or should you

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,120
share the resource i think a lot of

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,839
times we find ourselves

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,399
not blogging and not doing youtubes and

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,639
not

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
doing talks at conferences because

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
there's a fear

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
that well someone's already done that

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,240
that whole thing's been done

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,839
i mean i'm not going to do a python 101

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,199
course

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:07,199
it's been done but this is the thing

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,600
your experience as a new

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,000
cloud developer or new python developer

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,199
is your experience so you should create

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
content

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
even though it's already been done in

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,439
fact i'm doing a git

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
101 course right now and i'm doing it

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
without looking at

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,679
anyone else's get courses because it's

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,439
my experience and me learning git

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,000
and i think it has value to put those

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,360
things out so i want to encourage people

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,919
who are thinking about being more social

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,559
putting out more content to not look at

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,280
other people's content because your

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
journey your experience is super

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,960
valuable

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,880
it's how you did things now i do some of

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,080
these things in the list but not all of

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
them

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,520
i don't have to compare myself to other

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,480
people by

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
doing nine things by doing the most

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
here's some

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,360
examples of some friends that i think do

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
a really great job

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
here's one so grace mcjones works with

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,120
me at microsoft on

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,919
azure and what she does i think is

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,720
really great

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
is she uses linkedin that's her blogging

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
platform

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
that's her youtube platform i've never

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
seen someone use

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
linkedin in that way some people say

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,559
well linkedin is just

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
facebook for business but it's it can be

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,760
a blogging platform it can be a video

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
platform you can do live video there

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,960
i never thought about that until i met

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,799
grace so she's turned linkedin to

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,280
linkedin into her place

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,799
i have a friend who is on twitch and he

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
does everything on twitch

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,320
and he loves twitch because it feeds his

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,760
spirit he likes

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,160
live coding that stresses me out so i

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,679
found

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,440
my place on youtube and i do my work

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,720
on youtube because it feeds my spirit it

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
makes me happy

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
so rather than looking at a list of

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
things and

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
feeling the weight and the stress of

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,440
having to do all of these things

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,120
i try all of these different things and

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
i pick the ones that make me the most

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,640
happy

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,840
there's a great comment here in the chat

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,880
it's about giving a different

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,000
perspective

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,760
exactly your perspective is important

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,120
because how i learned python is

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,160
different from how grace

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,840
learned it or ali or marlene and those

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,440
experiences are all valid

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
and if you think about all the different

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,480
people and all of our different ages and

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,200
gender

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,559
and races and countries and languages

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,320
and all the different platforms and

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
blogs and tweets and githubs

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,960
there's a combination of places there's

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,280
so many places and so many cool people

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,120
and so many cool technologies you can

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,160
put your content out there

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
and you don't need to worry about

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,919
whether someone's done it before so

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,000
definitely do it

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
marlene in the comments here is making a

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,799
really great point

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,960
that you learn more when you're

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,520
preparing a talk and ali said the same

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,280
thing

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,240
it's a really great point because the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,320
content you make is for you

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
now i've been blogging for almost 20

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,960
years

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,880
was i blogging the whole time for you

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
like i'm sitting here in my house in

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
portland oregon

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
and i'm going i have so much knowledge

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,880
i'm going to blog about it for the

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
people

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,080
i'll give them my knowledge because i'm

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,919
so clever

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,880
no it was a diary it's just so i can

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,840
google myself

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
later and find out oh good i forgot i

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
had blogged about that

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,720
error message and i'm glad that i did

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
that it's so important to

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,000
think about things like that so a lot of

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
people having a

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,159
a sense that this there's no time to

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,320
blog well i don't have time

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
or what i'm working on a secret what

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,480
would i have to say

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,159
i don't know enough to blog i think that

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,400
you can actually be really

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,760
honest with people about what you know

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,559
and what you don't know

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
here's a good example i bought a 3d

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,760
printer

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
i bought a little 3d printer a couple of

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
years ago

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,400
and i wrote a blog post about the basics

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,760
of 3d printing

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,520
now remember not an expert just a person

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,520
that bought a 3d printer

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,200
so i was really clear i actually joked

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
about it in the title of the blog and

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,159
you can see there that i

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,159
said from someone with 16 whole hours

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,919
experience

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,360
i think i'd been printing for two days

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,240
at that point so i

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,559
wrote up how 3d printing what it meant

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,520
to me as a beginner i'm sure i got some

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,880
things wrong

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,200
and that's okay now why would i write

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
this

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,080
up though why would i take the time to

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,799
slap the keyboard and write that up

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,400
this is where productivity comes in this

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
is really important this is one of the

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,840
most important things

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,799
that's changed my life and how i think

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
about

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,120
producing content and sharing things

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,200
with the community

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,440
i think people need to conserve their

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,159
keystrokes

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,600
so what does that mean let's say that

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,960
one of my new friends here

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,000
i'll just look in the chat let's say

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,039
maxwell emails me after the talk

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,559
and says hey great talk scott thanks so

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
much for coming

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,840
to our conference thanks for coming to

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,039
pycon africa um

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
i have a question and he asks an amazing

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,919
question

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,919
and i go ah that's a great question oh

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,240
my goodness but then at the same time

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
like

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,480
i don't know i don't know this person i

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,000
got stuff to do

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,440
do i give maxwell the gift of my

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
keystrokes

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
and why would i think about it like that

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,080
what a weird way to think about it

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,559
well you have a finite

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,039
number of keystrokes left in your hands

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,360
before you die

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,559
that's a really weird and morbid thing

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
to say isn't it

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,440
well you can only type so fast and

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,360
you're only going to live so long

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,280
and you're not going to get any extra

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
keystrokes they're not going to give you

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
more time

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,840
so if maxwell says i have a question

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,840
about your talk

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
and it's an amazing question and a

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,720
really good question after a talk

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,720
is a gift so what maxwell is doing is

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,760
actually giving me a gift

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,120
of an amazing question but then i might

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,000
type on the keyboard for

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,039
000 keystrokes 3 000 keystrokes takes me

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
40 minutes

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,960
and i mail this amazing answer to this

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,440
amazing question

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,440
back to maxwell and max was like cool

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,159
how many lives have i affected there one

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,039
rando

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
one random person emails me i give them

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,960
all this

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,440
free content and they go cool

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
what should i do instead what i should

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,640
do

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,640
is i should write a blog post

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
with the answer to the question and then

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
link back to it

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,400
then i send my new friend the link to

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
the blog post

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
and if one additional person sees that

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
blog post

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
if one additional person googles and

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,880
finds that blog post

00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,080
i've doubled and tripled and quadrupled

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,880
the keystrokes that i had i can actually

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
get free keystrokes because i'm sleeping

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,799
and 10 people read

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
my blog post

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,080
dustin makes a great comment here which

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,720
is very true

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
i type 100 words a minute but about 90

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,080
of it is just backspace

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,120
which is very true i actually made a

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
website

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,279
about this that i would encourage you to

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,200
check out it's at keysleft.com

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,600
i literally made a website where you can

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,799
put in how fast you type

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
and how old you are and it will tell you

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,640
how many books you have left in you

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,480
how many computer programs you have left

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,039
and the reason that i do this

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,240
is not to make you feel sad or feel

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
weird about how

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
long you're going to live it's about

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,720
being intentional

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,880
it's about deciding what you're going to

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
do this is super important

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
because i feel particularly as a person

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,080
who's a little bit older

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,400
that you've only got so much time here

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,039
do you want to let your life

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,520
happen by default or do you want to

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,360
decide what you're going to do

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,400
so this has informed my experience as a

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,640
social developer because if i

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
have this limited number of keystrokes i

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,600
don't put them in

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,960
email i put them somewhere

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,159
with a url so i would encourage you

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,240
to anytime whether it be at work or

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,840
personal if someone sends you an email

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,480
and you're going to type an answer

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
where can you put that on medium on

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,600
twitter

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,039
on facebook hopefully on a blog

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,640
somewhere with your own

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,640
url if you can

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,320
so that you can share that information

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,320
with other people

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
i've also gone recently and i started

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,240
doing youtubes

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,080
and these are super fun because it turns

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,440
out you can use a tool like

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,159
obs the open broadcasting studio

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,720
it's free and open source and i can just

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,960
press record and i can start talking

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
and it's kind of cool i discovered last

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,679
week that if i

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,760
make a funny youtube video

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,720
thumbnail it makes me look like i'm

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,120
official

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
i'm not really that official so i've

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
been writing about

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,000
computer stuff that they didn't teach

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,799
you like for example

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
get 101 basics and what's cool about

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,279
that

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,440
is if someone emails me hey scott i want

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,320
to learn git

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
i send them to that video i've made a

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,200
frequently asked questions

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
of my life i'll give an example if i

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,400
said to marlene

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,559
hey i love the conference help me

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
organize an online conference

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,039
if she spends one-on-one time with me

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,080
teaching me how to organize a conference

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,720
with the other organizers that is

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,120
taking up a lot of her time but if she

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,200
wrote up a cookbook

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
or pamphlet that explained how to do an

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,400
online conference

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,000
that means her keystrokes scale

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,159
that's a really great way to think about

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,840
it another thing that i've done recently

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,279
is i've had a podcast

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,240
i've done over 750 episodes every

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,960
thursday

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
for the last 15 years i've had a great

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,640
conversation

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,039
so how many times see marlene's going to

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,960
publish a book soon that's amazing

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,320
that's great her keystrokes are going to

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,120
good work so

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,159
my podcast is a conversation about

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
technology

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,520
every thursday with a fresh face

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,840
and what's great about this is you know

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,320
how often people say can i pick your

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,559
brain

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,640
can i take you out for coffee i want to

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,360
just pick your brain a little bit

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,399
i don't really have time to have a

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,440
coffee with you

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,880
i'm sure you're a lovely person um

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,120
but i you know there's only so many

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,080
hours and there's only so many coffees

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,640
that i can potentially have but if i

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,039
recorded our conversation

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,279
put a little music at the beginning now

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,039
our coffee turns into

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,360
an experience for everybody and it's a

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,799
shared conversation

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,360
this podcast is actually just 750

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,039
coffees that i've had with new friends

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,960
where we share that information

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,640
but when you make a piece of content

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,960
when you make a video

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,880
when you make a podcast if you can

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,799
convert it to text

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,159
that can become a blog post or a

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,679
pamphlet or a book

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:34,240
i could potentially take the transcripts

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,880
from over 300 hours of technical content

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,279
and then turn that into a book and that

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,559
then

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,399
multiplies my content so if you learn

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,520
something new

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,360
write it up send it around but can it

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,720
become a youtube can it become a podcast

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
can it become a book can it become a

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
pamphlet

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,399
can it become a course one piece of

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,919
content one thing that you may

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,520
can turn into a multiplier of different

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,120
kinds of content and that's really

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,960
exciting

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
now one of the other things that i think

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,200
is really important is

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,880
uh social media and all the things that

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,840
are happening in the world right now

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,640
are slowing us down if you think about

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,679
someone who is

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,320
sprinting or someone is uh

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
is running and then they suddenly get

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,279
interrupted

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
you don't think about a runner like

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,840
usain bolt

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
and he's running and he's focused he's

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
sprinting and he's sprinting and then he

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,360
gets a tweet and in the middle of the

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,080
sprint

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
he checks his phone that would make the

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,159
sprinting

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,440
less useful you're not really

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,440
effective or efficient when you're not

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,880
focused on the thing that you're doing

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
so i would really encourage people to

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,880
think about

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,760
am i in my flow am i in my productive

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
place

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
and this gets back to that idea of being

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,880
intentional

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,240
when are you most productive are you

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
most productive in the middle of the

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,799
night

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,640
are you a morning person are you best

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,200
after lunch

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
we we know when we are productive but we

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,840
don't set up our systems

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,080
to really make ourselves productive when

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,039
was the last time you set up a meeting

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,760
with yourself to sit quietly and think

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,440
about

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,919
how i can set my day up to be most

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,880
productive i did this recently

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,559
and i said you know i code really well

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,840
from about two in the afternoon till

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,360
about six that's

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,399
somehow that's when my brain works the

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,360
best i make youtube videos really well

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,240
when everyone's asleep after midnight so

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,360
all my videos are

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,880
late night in the dark like this and i

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,360
write emails really well

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,799
in the morning so when i know about that

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,799
i can schedule

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,080
my meetings my podcasts and the

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,919
different things i want to do

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
because i've been intentional about when

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
i'm good at something

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,799
and then i'm unapologetic about when i'm

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,799
not good at something

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,440
this is me in my flow

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
one of the things that you can do to

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,240
remain in your flow is to mute

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,320
words and block easily on

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,120
twitter i think a lot of times people

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,080
spend an inordinate amount of time

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,000
arguing with strangers on the internet

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
and remember that arguing with strangers

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,120
on the internet

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,559
does not ship your product and it

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,279
doesn't make your software

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,279
have fewer bugs those are gifts that

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,080
you're giving people

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,600
strangers so why would you put any

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,760
energy

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
into arguing with a stranger on the

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,960
internet well really

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,720
why would you talk to anyone that

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,799
doesn't love you

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,840
no one has ever changed their political

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,320
opinion

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,039
for any reason because you argued with

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,480
them

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,760
on twitter the other thing that i would

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,279
encourage you to do

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,919
is not worry about this silly green

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,880
graph that shows your contributions on

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,240
github

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,880
maybe you work for a company that

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,000
doesn't use github that green graph

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,000
is not a representation of your value

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,279
or whether or not you're a good

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,960
programmer or not

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,440
i'm going to skip over a little bit of

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
these things

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,240
i also want to talk about internal

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,000
advocacy

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
not everyone is an extrovert not

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,399
everyone has a big personality and they

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,799
want to be on stage at a conference

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,159
so when you're an introvert or maybe a

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,120
quieter person

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,799
can you advocate inside your company

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,519
inside your working group

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,279
can you give a talk to four or five

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,320
people like a lunch talk

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,880
or a brown bag education doesn't have to

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,840
be

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,440
a megaphone where you're talking to

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,039
thousands of people and if you don't

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,320
have thousands of followers

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,640
there's no value you can also advocate

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,840
for

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,279
good software practices and teach people

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,159
inside your company or inside your group

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,000
you can do one-on-one career coaching

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,799
you can be a welcoming community member

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,320
you can do small morale events there's

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,320
all kinds of things you can do

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
even if you don't want to be a big

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,120
visible external

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,320
person so if you're out there and you're

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,159
creating content

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,000
you want to try to stay relevant and the

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,080
best way to do that is to remind

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
yourself that everyone is an expert at

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,559
something

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,480
and even if you don't feel like an

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,399
expert you are an expert

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,480
at you your experience your journey

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,760
and writing about that talking about

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
that blogging

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,559
youtubing about that has value

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
because everyone is an expert at

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,000
something

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,480
i think that people are not blogging

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,600
enough and they're not doing this

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,120
at domains that they control i think

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,880
we're at a really interesting time right

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,880
now in software where if you can afford

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,840
to register a domain

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,960
you can get a free ssl certificate at

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,880
let's encrypt

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,480
and you can afford to get just even a

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,840
static website or

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,360
a free github pages website

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,159
you can blog for free so github pages

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,399
would be a really great static website

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,799
or even the smallest

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,320
hosting provider would allow you to have

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,280
your domain your content that you

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,919
control

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,560
you don't know if medium is going to go

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,040
away

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,760
and take all of your content with you

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,320
but i know that i bought hanselman.com

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,560
my last name 20 years ago and it is my

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,560
domain they cannot take my domain away

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,839
they can't take my urls away

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,560
so stop giving twitter and facebook the

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,599
gift of your keystrokes

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,240
own your content and when you're out

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,079
there

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,760
be yourself with consistent and

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,679
professional usernames

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,639
and clear avatars that way you can be

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,440
one kind persona

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,200
this is some examples of some folks out

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,320
there that i think are really great

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,440
at branding themselves online

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,359
angie jones has a great

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,720
avatar that she uses everywhere and a

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,760
really organized

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,200
blog that i like a lot some people don't

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,400
want their photographs

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,680
online i really liked this woman's

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
website she actually has quotes on her

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,680
website

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,079
about why she's awesome i think that is

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,240
so

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,359
cool she actually has quotes about how

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,720
cool she is

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,839
almost like their movie movie quotes

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,160
of uh you know why this is a great film

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,119
that you should watch

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,880
this gentleman chris coyer has a great

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,560
website and he actually has

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,400
choices about how his bio looks

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,599
and it shows that he's a web person

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,480
because you can pick

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,480
whether or not it's html or markdown

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,320
one of my favorite developers sofia

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,240
abdullah

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,760
has a cool url that literally tells you

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,200
how awesome she is

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,680
it's sofia dot rocks and she's got

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,119
a great introduction about how she's an

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,359
open source developer

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,880
and what she does and what she works on

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
these are examples

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,040
of folks that are putting themselves out

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,760
there and they're making great content

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,680
that's going to make you a better person

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,599
so i would encourage you to go out there

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,119
if you don't know where to start find a

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,040
mentor

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,320
but i would also encourage you to be a

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
mentor

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,240
i don't think that you get to do just

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,400
one so i have mentees

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,000
that i am mentoring but i also have

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,040
people who mentor me

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,680
it's a two-way experience

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,920
so my my my ask my call to action to you

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,119
before we go into the q a and marlene

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,640
joins me here

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,040
is that you go out there and share your

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,359
energy put out good work

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,960
don't waste your keystrokes certainly

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,240
don't waste them arguing with strangers

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,480
on the internet

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,920
be kind put out good things and that

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,800
energy will come back

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
to you thank you very much for having me

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,440
at the conference and let's do some

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
q a marlene

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,480
hello yeah um

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,520
but yes so i am just gonna look

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,440
you're an inspiration i will start with

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,119
a question maybe while people write

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,640
please if you have questions write them

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,480
in the chat but

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,079
i was gonna say um so scott how's the

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,760
best way so

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,839
i think a lot of a lot of the time

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
i think some people want to be content

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,720
creationist to be able to put themselves

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,240
in a better uh position in terms of

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,359
maybe getting a job or getting a

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,599
following

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,920
um and for you what would you say

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,839
you know first of all do you think it's

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,520
important to have a large following

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,119
is that something that's valuable to

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,240
people that people should strive

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,880
to do um and then secondly

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,000
uh if you do think it's valuable how do

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,640
people actually

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,599
get a following yeah okay so that's a

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,560
really good question

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,599
so when you say when you said that i

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,440
noticed that you said

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,359
a large following i don't think it's

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,640
important to have a large following

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,400
having

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,839
numbers doesn't matter it's garbage

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,880
i don't care if i'm a hiring manager

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,680
i want to google for you with bing or

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,320
whatever

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,880
and i want to find you and i want to say

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,200
look

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,960
here's a person with a domain a

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,760
well-organized blog

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,800
and thoughtful writing when i go to your

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,800
blog when i google

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,280

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,040
i see good content i see technical

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,200
excellence

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,200
nowhere in the googling for you as a

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,640
hiring manager hr person

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,400
do i see any numbers about following and

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,800
if you have a million followers on

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
youtube or you have 10

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,800
does either of those things make you a

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,480
better shipper if i'm hiring you to ship

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,440
software

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,560
stop worrying about the likes my friends

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,320
the following

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
is all bs

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,200
it doesn't matter famous programmer 10x

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,520
developer it's all

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,560
trash i just want to see someone who's

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,599
excited

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,480
who is enthusiastic who makes things and

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,480
who has a

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,760
a moderately organized blog here's

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,520
another thing to think about

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,240
people say well i don't have time to

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,599
blog can you blog once a week

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,119
if you could blog once a month

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,119
and you did it for two or three years

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,880
you'd have 30 or 40 articles

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,880
and if i'm a hiring manager and i find

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
30 40 great technical articles written

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,400
by you

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,119
just one a month that's gold i'm like

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,200
wow here's a

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,359
they're a good writer good communicator

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,440
they're a coder this is gold

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,000
now i blog twice a week why twice

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,119
because once didn't feel like enough and

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,560
every day is stupid

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,640
right that's insane so twice a week

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,160
meant a hundred a year a hundred a year

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,680
do that for a couple of years you wrote

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,520
a book and you just did it in your spare

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,480
time

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,359
does that make sense yes that makes a

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,240
lot of sense

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,040
um so that answers my question that's

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,000
really great

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,880
i know jeff has a a question and jeff

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
says

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,200
don't you think that creating on your

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,280
own domain will make you lost

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,640
time in developing the website than

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,520
writing your contact

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,160
content so would you lose time instead

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,040
of putting

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
it into writing your own content that is

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
a

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,119
that is a very good question so that's

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,119
actually there's two ways to look at

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,359
that so jeff is concerned about

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,359
creating the website and is different

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,839
than developing the content well

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,440
so you don't have to do that you can

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,119
just do github pages

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,480
you can do medium you could make a

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,200
wordpress site in

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,520
a weekend you would require zero effort

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
you

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,720
go and get a free theme you put the site

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
up you're done so

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,920
the argument that you're wasting time

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,599
developing the website

00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,319
i think doesn't hold but if you can

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,359
run a website keep it up keep the ssl

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,240
certificates

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,599
registered if it goes down get an email

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,160
put it back up again

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,440
every time that happens that's a thing

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,520
you can write about

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,359
you now have experience running a

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,359
website 24 7.

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,720
i can say that i've kept my website up

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,800
for 20 years

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,000
and i can talk about all the war stories

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,000
about the time

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,920
like like here's the one i have a bug in

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,720
my website where it goes down for an

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,960
hour

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,119
every year when the united states does

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,200
daylight savings time

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,839
that's an article like it's a stupid

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,079
thing like at 2 am the time becomes 1

00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,079
my website gets confused i could do a

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,280
whole talk about how that's stupid and

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,000
why my software is

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,359
buggy because i have the experience of

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
running the website so i would say to

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,839
jeff

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,240
that the creating the content on your

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,680
own domain that developing the website

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,760
those are articles to write everything

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,960
everything that happens to you is a

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,720
moment is a gift

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,720
that you can then use to turn into

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,079
content

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,359
absolutely um thank you for that answer

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,000
then and this is a question i had as

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,920
well

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,040
um bruce lee was asking not sure if

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,280
you've covered this already

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,960
how do you balance everything you do do

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,000
you have any tips on how to be

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,319
productive or find good balance between

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,319
work life and content creation

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,640
that is a very good question and i'm

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,599
actually going to bring up a link that i

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,560
will put

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,839
in the chat that is my complete list of

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,800
productivity tips

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,200
it is about intentionality i talked

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
about

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
deliberate practice

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
it's not about willpower people think

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,400
it's about

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,400
sleeping less drinking more caffeine

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,079
you know just hustle you know hustle

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,440
culture yeah i mean you're not working

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,680
hard enough

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,800
no it's not it's about balance but it's

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,800
also not about just

00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:03,119
losing hours if you can be intentional

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,200
and go okay it's noon i have two hours

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
until whatever the next thing am i going

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,160
to use this time or am i just going to

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,760
let this time

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,400
happen so for me it's about scheduling

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,760
and it's about

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,000
being um deliberate about what's

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,359
important

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,560
um making a list sorting it

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,560
and then saying no to stuff

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,599
like like right now um here's a great

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,119
example i

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,640
emailed you and asked you to come on my

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,839
podcast

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,520
and you know what you did you said

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,520
no not right now

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,319
you did that you remember because you

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,760
said no and i

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,319
no you you're organizing a conference

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,200
you sorted the things in your life that

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,680
are important

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,640
you were intentionally said talk to me

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,960
when the conference is over

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,680
that sounds terrible that sounds like i

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,720
was just like

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,359
no but that's what i did here at

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,800
what's important so to uh my friend uh

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,200
mr glover

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
what do you do you sort the things you

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,720
put impactful things at the top

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,160
and you say no or you postpone stuff

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,640
till later

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,760
so what you did was great and natural

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,920
saying no

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,520
is the most powerful thing that you can

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,960
do to be

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,960
a productive individual

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,640
definitely and by the way i will be on

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,440
scott's podcast

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,079
where anyone who's concerned that i have

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,200
confidence

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,720
the conference is over whenever

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,760
yes very excited for that as well um

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,680
so oya or yundamola

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,040
is asking what will you say to a

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,319
beginner just starting with programming

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,440
that is a good one so uh oyendabola

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:57,119
the the thing

00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,400
is that there's computer science

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,079
there's software engineering and there's

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,880
programming and they're different stuff

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,319
the science of computers and how they

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
are built

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,599
is very theoretical and you go to

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,800
university for it

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,079
and it's interesting but it's very much

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,160
not practical it's very much theoretical

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,440
then there's software engineering which

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,480
is the literal

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,560
how does one ship software effectively

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,560
it's things like pair programming and

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,280
extreme development and scrum and you

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,079
know project management and

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,960
unit testing and then there's

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,359
programming

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,720
which is the syntax and all those kind

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,880
of things

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,000
acknowledging that those things are

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,760
different

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,400
and thinking about the ones that you're

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,480
good at the ones you want to learn

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,760
as opposed to just saying i want to be a

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,640
coder

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,119
you have to think about your systems so

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,480
the

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,400
the thing i would say to a beginner

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,640
who's just getting started

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,640
is to kind of make a list of the things

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,680
that you know about computers

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,680
look at the gaps think about what

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,520
what like looks interesting to you like

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,119
if you're a data scientist

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,960
do you really need to know about the

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,960
internals of the task manager or the

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,480
activity monitor on a mac and help

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,000
processes and ports and stuff no you're

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,359
a data scientist

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,720
so you can say no you cannot learn stuff

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,839
so for a beginner focus and

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,119
consciously say i'm not going to learn

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,079
that and that will help you not get

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,920
overwhelmed

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,079
because it's incredibly overwhelming

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,079
when you start out in software because

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,160
you feel like i've got the weight of 50

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,720
years of software to learn

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,760
so just as i said be be productive by

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,119
saying no

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,960
you can start out as a beginner we're

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,680
starting programming by saying no

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,200
pick a language start getting good at it

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,839
join our community

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,839
and then slowly build up those other

00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
skills

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,920
a hundred percent that's great advice

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,040
scott

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,000
um i i was saying in the comments

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,880
ellie's saying can you talk about how

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,079
your perch learning i love analogies

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,880
i like analogies so i'm teaching git

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,760
on my youtube right now i'm doing a get

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,760
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,440
series and i would encourage people to

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,680
go and check that out

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,800
and in doing that i thought about like

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,200
how do you explain

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,480
git to somebody how do you even explain

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,280
source control

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,079
to someone and i started talking about

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
it in terms of

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,800
time travel because we all love time

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,240
travel and we're watching netflix and

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,640
seeing how people go into the other

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,839
timeline and they kill their grandfather

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,680
and then you've never been born you

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,680
killed your grandfather

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,040
that's a really cool fun way to think

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,280
about how software

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,040
works right and like source control i

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,559
made a branch and i did this and i

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,000
changed it and i merged it back into

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,839
this timeline

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,839
so whenever i want to learn something

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,520
new i look at something

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,319
real in the real world and i come up

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,240
with some kind of an analogy

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,359
right like for example if you think

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,480
about like c

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,720
python we had a great talk earlier on c

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,480
python and the low level things that

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,079
make python work

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,240
that's basically teaching us how to

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,640
drive a stick shift

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,440
but some of us just take combis and just

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,640
take an uber

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,480
right you take taxify and and and

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,800
and that's cool because the see python

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,160
people they know how to fix the car

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,720
and the rest of us just get in the

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,559
minibus you know what i'm saying

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,319
and that's okay i don't need to be a

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,040
mechanic to just ride

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,040
in the minibus

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:49,839
that's fantastic

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,359
and the e.t the emergency taxis the

00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,760
combis and the minibuses for folks that

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,200
aren't

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,079
from that area the guy's always hanging

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,240
out of the mini bus

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,200
you know have you been you've been

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,000
disguised

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,000
and he's always like

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,720
you know and they're like

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:27,200
yeah he's probably laughing so hard

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,839
um but that's fantastic i will

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,359
give some time does anyone have any last

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,040
minute questions

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,520
um we are at the end of this session but

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,599
i

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,640
i think we can take one more question if

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,359
anyone

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,480
would like to uh would like to ask scott

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,640
something

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,359
this has been really great by the way i

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,520
really i think this has been so fun

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,040
um yeah anyone have any other questions

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,880
thank you for having me we'll give it a

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,000
bit

00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,800
yes zombies

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,200
are amazing comedies are so dangerous

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,880
that's

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,640
been saying glitches never sounded so

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,119
thrilling yes i think we should all

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,640
watch

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:12,319
the series it looks good um

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,880
okay peter peter is saying

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,319
would you advise to sticking to a

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,680
particular channel for

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,079
sharing content you've created oh and

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
then

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,200
ali is saying can you talk about what

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,880
you're excited about so maybe take

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,240
pictures and then sticking to a

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,640
particular channel

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,480
so we have a saying in the us i don't

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,480
know if it's a universal saying

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:37,119
um putting all the wood behind one arrow

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,040
i put everything at hanselman.com and

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,720
then it kind of fans out from that so

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,839
the arrow that i'm putting all the wood

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,599
behind when i

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:48,079
throw my bow and arrow is my website

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,599
if i go and spread things out i have 15

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,720
different websites

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,000
or 15 different twitter accounts

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,559
i'm i'm diluting my content so yes i

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,400
think

00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,760
pick a channel that makes you happy

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,040
don't don't start with

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,960
three don't say okay i've gone from zero

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,240
to a youtube and a tick tock and then

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,240
just pick one

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:15,119
put all the wood behind one arrow aim

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,119
and focus that would be my tip to peter

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,119
and then ollie's asking about what i'm

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,760
excited about

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,200
and then we'll just do one more what am

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,079
i excited about

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,400
i there's just so much stuff going on i

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,280
like

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,119
i like uh physical things like raspberry

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,160
pies and stuff like i'm on my desk here

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,720
i've got like

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,520
all kinds of raspberry pies and like i'm

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,200
working on this

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,640
i'm working on a raspberry pi robot that

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,319
i'm working on like i have a broken

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,280
wheel so i'm trying to fix

00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,079
fix that i like physical stuff i like

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,680
teaching

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,520
people how to like do iot

00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,000
things i'm working on a pi portal a

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,640
python portal you know this device

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,480
the pi dashboard and i'm making it show

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,160
my blood sugar because i'm diabetic

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,559
so i write a little bit of python use

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,119
micro python and circuit python

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,720
and then it goes out and so then i can

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,400
have a little screen

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,160
that will there you go it's starting up

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,839
and it will go up and i can put it on my

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,839
wall and it'll show my family my blood

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,200
sugar so if i'm having a

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,000
low blood sugar wow

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,000
issue gala

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,720
that's very cool that's awesome

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,680
um i'm excited about that looks super

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,680
cool i was so

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,240
very interested in circuit python and

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,720
and python for hardware so

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,599
very excited to see that you're doing

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,960
that

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:40,000
um it's almost on the hour so i

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,440
i don't know yao has one question more

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,440
so i don't know maybe you can answer

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,839
yows and then call it quits

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,520
so you always say what challenges did

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,240
you face when starting software

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,079
engineering

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,760
and how my biggest challenge having

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,119
software engineering was when they told

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,920
me i needed to know

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,640
advanced math and they they told me i

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,839
had to learn

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,599
calculus and it almost killed me it was

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,440
just incredibly difficult

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,359
i found that i needed to focus on

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,559
boolean algebra

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,680
and understand logic but calculus was

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,040
not useful to me

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,119
for the things that i'm doing i'm not a

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,359
data scientist so for

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,319
regular coding regular programming i

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,800
think the

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,480
challenge was someone telling me that i

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,000
had to learn something

00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,000
or i wouldn't be a free have to learn

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,200
two years of calculus or you won't be a

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,200
good programmer

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,119
um so yeah the challenges are usually

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,119
what they call gatekeeping

00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,640
when someone tells you well you're not

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,480
really a python programmer unless you

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,880
take three years of

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,240
calculus so yeah that was my biggest

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,520
challenge by the way that's my

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:45,440
python portal showing my

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,920
my blood sugar and then an arrow

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,760
i can't really see but yeah it's like it

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:56,880
turns green and red and yellow based on

00:53:49,760 --> 00:54:00,160
my blood sugar being low or high

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,559
very very cool um

00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,680
awesome well i think that is all the

00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,520
time we have for this session we have to

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,839
yeah we just have to check if the next

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,319
session is actually gonna happen or not

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,319
um

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,800
but if you do have questions for scott

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:18,000
scott is a really friendly person

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,640
clearly um i don't know scott i think

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,079
twitter is a good place that's the place

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,040
where i'm putting all the wood behind

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,880
one arrow

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,440
but i would encourage people to go to my

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,280
blog at hanselman.com

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,119
and then you've got my podcast my
