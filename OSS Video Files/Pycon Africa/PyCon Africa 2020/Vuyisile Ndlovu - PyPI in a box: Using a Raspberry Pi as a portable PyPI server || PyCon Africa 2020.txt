Title: Vuyisile Ndlovu - PyPI in a box: Using a Raspberry Pi as a portable PyPI server || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Problems common in Africa are power cuts and weak Internet connections. This makes it difficult for developers on the continent to get access to the resources they need such as the Python Package Index(PyPI) when they need to. In the talk I will discuss how to clone the PyPI repository to a Raspberry Pi and set it up as a local PyPI server to allow installing Python packages even when the Internet or electricity is out.

Creating your own portable PyPI server can be useful when coding with little or poor Internet access, running workshops such as Django girls, or when coding during power blackout.
