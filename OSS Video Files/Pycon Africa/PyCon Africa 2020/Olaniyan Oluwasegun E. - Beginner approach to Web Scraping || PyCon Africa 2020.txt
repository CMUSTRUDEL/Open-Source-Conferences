Title: Olaniyan Oluwasegun E. - Beginner approach to Web Scraping || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Web scraping is about extracting meaningful data from webpages.  It helps gather structured/unstructured data from multiple sources in the Internet with ease. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web into a central local database or spreadsheet for analysis or retrieval. It is one of the key skills of a Data Scientist.


Web Scraping is important for better access to company data, market analysis, chatbot, obtaining the latest changes on your competitors, Sentiment analysis, to gather contact details of businesses or individuals from websites like linkedin.com, for Research purposes, extracting various Government websites, most of which do not provide an easy way to download the data which they display.
My talk will be the use of Youtube data for illustration.

This Talk is mostly for Beginners that wants to have practical knowledge of Web Scraping i.e. The "Hello World" of Web Scraping.

Knowledge of Python is required.

Installation of Requests and Beautiful Soup library is required.

	00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,760
i everyone

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,760
my name is and um

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,119
graduate i graduated last year and

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,000
i'm 27 here in nigeria

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,520
because that's what we use is mandatory

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
for anyone in countries in nigeria

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
i'm a graphic designer and i'm a data

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,840
scientist

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,280
so today i'm going to be teaching

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,920
beginner approach to

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,640
web scripting and

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,440
before i start um this are what they

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
need to do

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,039
the meaning of web scripting why it's

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
important and why we use

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,360
i start i would like to see

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,400
um a quote i saw when i started

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,479
scripting it says imagine you want to

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
pull a large amount of data from

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,640
websites i want to do it

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
quickly as possible i would reduce

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,680
manually

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,720
going to each website and getting data

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,079
but the answer is what's creeping

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,680
because extracting a lot of data

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,159
manually will be slow and difficult

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
so web scripting can help you reduce

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,759
this

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,840
stress so what is web scripting it's uh

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,840
an animated automated method are used to

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
expand

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,520
data unstructured data from the website

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
from any

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,920
web page then you make it structured

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,280
and do whatever tax

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,319
and we there are different ways of

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,280
um selecting websites such as the online

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
services

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,280
we have api and writing our whole code

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
but yeah today we are going to write our

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,720
own code because

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,760
it's much better and makes it gives you

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,720
it's 24 restrictions to what's wrong

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,760
so why would scripting one of the

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
importance of

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,760
web scripting is a price confusion

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,720
for example there was a site called um

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
it's what it does it extract different

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
um

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
product contents from different sites

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
they do

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,560
analysis and upload them in their home

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
page to

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,800
such data is large and research manually

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,760
from different

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
sources would be difficult and slow so

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
web scripting

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,280
what they did was script with different

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
sites and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
upload it on your own website another

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
example of this price comparison is if

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
you want to

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
compare a price of different competitors

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
as a business organization

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,920
to extract from the website

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,040
and do analysis and give

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,400
data driven decisions and that

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,360
under um importance of web scripting is

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,159
image country

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,920
you can create an automated email

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,519
instructor

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,599
to extract multiple image

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,159
multiple email addresses and you send

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,040
book and send off emails

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
messages to these emails social media

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
another example

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,360
the importance of web scripting is

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
social media script

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,519
this is like for example twitter

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,879
we can give your organization

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,640
as a page on twitter you can review

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,239
extract customers review from

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,400
twitter and do analysis

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,319
analysis to see if the to see what

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
the customers are saying about your

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,040
product so that's

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
how the use cases of web scripting and

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,160
social media

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:26,000
then for research and development um

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,360
here uh development you for instance

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the coffee 19 data which is

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,759
the numerous sites if you want to make a

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,199
research like apply models

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,560
to predict for the future

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,840
you can go to different sites for

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,479
probably the country website extract

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,199
recovered 19 cases from the site or go

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,600
to world

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
health organization site to extract the

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
profit 19

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,199
um data and you can make your research

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,840
and develop you can also develop chat

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,759
roots also to reduce

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,120
fake news when you extract data from

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,520
such um sites

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,560
so another example is job listing some

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,199
what some do is some people extract

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
constructive data from different sites

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,680
for

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,199
top employment they make it structured

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,000
and you can apply analysis

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
to show that to show people structurally

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
of

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,320
different um job list job

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
so to do this i want few examples of web

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,960
scripting so because of our time i won't

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,960
go too much

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,199
so is it lego it is and it is not

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,360
it is legal if the web page you want to

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,360
extract in this permission form

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
and it is illegal if the webpage you

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
want to spread

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
does not give you permission to script

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,319
your site

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,360
so that's what you can check the about

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,039
page or i think it should be the about

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,560
page

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,680
or mostly the photo analyze the last

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
bottom of the web page to see if

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
it is written data the page can be

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,960
extracted

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:26,080
and why why python for web scripting

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,880
python is one of it's very easy and

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,000
user-friendly

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,000
beginner phone so that's why it's

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,280
not the best way to do scripting that's

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,400
these the syntax are very easy they are

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
readable

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
uh it does largely collection of

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,759
libraries

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
such that these libraries can be used

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,759
for different

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:55,280
are used for specific reasons um

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,919
synthetics are easily understandable you

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,240
the course you write a small and perform

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,560
a lot of

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
tags for you and we have large

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,080
communities

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
for fighting so if you have problem you

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
should

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
tell the community look for communities

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
and

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
within a few minutes we will answer your

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
question might be answered

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
so that's one of the reasons why we used

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,039
python for this

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,400
so how does web scripting works

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,680
the this six steps

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,240
are the steps we're going to take

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,120
to successfully script a web page

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,280
first we'll find the urlable script we

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,639
will inspect the page

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,759
check the page read it define data

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,759
resource all

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,960
finding data i want to extract they will

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,639
write our code

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,919
we run the code and extract data

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
then the step is we store the data near

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,120
the platform

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
so this this is that are the steps we

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
take we live

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,919
in within a few minutes now

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
we take these steps one after them to

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,080
extract the web

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,919
page and show what show you what's how

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,720
easy python is

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,599
for web scripting the libraries we are

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
going to use

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:21,520
for scripting uh beautiful soup

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,680
pandas and requests beautiful soup

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,919
is a python library which

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,039
is used for reading

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,959
html documents or xml documents so

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,839
that's what we use

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,880
when you after you find the url use

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,120
business

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,880
to read the content in the html document

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,640
use pandas for our manipulation

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,320
and request is what i want to use to

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
read

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:59,680
urls so

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,480
on the python web page speaker page

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
i said which that's web room

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,959
installation of beautiful

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,959
soup and requests very necessary

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,640
it's very very easy for us to do

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,920
we just come here probably

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,959
yours command prompt and type beep

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
install request

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,200
that is for to install a request

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,440
click install request and to install

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:51,140
to type peep install

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:54,320
beautiful beautiful

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,320
[Music]

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,920
so these here these are lighted place

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,279
the my detox digital link to this

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,720
class they talk i'm doing it too and

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,040
um here is my twitter andrews for

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,279
case of picture so any questions or we

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,480
cannot question

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,560
as time infused and

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,959
so we're going to import our libraries

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
right

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,640
now so do not report a libraries

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
you write the we will do the next three

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
steps

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,160
which is um import requests um

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
from ps4 import and we're going to

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,440
import spandex

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,240
so these are the three main libraries

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,600
libraries for vital revolutions so we

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,279
are going to start with

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,800
this highlighted step

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,399
by finding the valuable script so

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,079
you are able to scrape this the url want

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,560
to script

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,560
this is it what one will split this

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
yes you are able to screen

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:22,720
um let's assume we're giving

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,720
a tax to look for a local language

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,680
and the meaning of our local we need it

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,480
probably we want to apply nlp to our

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
local language

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,160
for it to understand it and interpret

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,120
on the content so scoping is very

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
important

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
well you can use your screen for this

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,880
and

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720
what i want to do is we're going to

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,279
extract

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
about 50 because in universe my local

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,279
language

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,800
so this is my local language so i'm

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,360
going to extract

00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,399
50 uh

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,399
of my local language and um

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,360
there are the 15 languages from the 50

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
sentences here or 50 proverbs yes

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,760
languages

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
and the mean so i'm going to extract

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,040
them

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,040
and save it from as a csv file

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,350
so that's what i'm going to do basically

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
so and

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,839
[Music]

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
so

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,200
request to get the urls

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
which we said we'll find if on the first

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
level

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
so in order to read this you are ready

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,279
to extract url

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,839
we will use request.get then insert

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,839
the url

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
after i started the url you are going to

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
use

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,760
um beautiful soup to read the html

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
document

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,680
but before we do that we need to inspect

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,800
our page so here is the

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,450
web page right click on the page then

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,649
we click on respect

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,649
[Music]

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:52,000
to click on inspect we will

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,120
go over the backing of the webpage

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,399
to see how these

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,680
words have been um

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
have been written at the backing so you

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,880
know

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,000
i want to click on this place

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,560
so far or easily inspect easily

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
expectation

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
so by clicking a lighting you will see

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,279
it

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,639
if i remove my mouse from it text

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,959
and put it back to wherever one of the

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:34,560
uber program would like to extract

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,800
you see i like it shows the

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,360
um it shows where it is written in the

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
webpage

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,120
i click on it it takes me exactly

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,440
where it is and um well one of these

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
important things of skills was

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
understandable

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,279
scripting is you know

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,360
html tags yes

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:04,720
for estimating songs it's very important

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,880
so these we see inside and on

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,560
on that list this is another list

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,240
and we check the menu

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,000
click on this again and tap on

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,040
this click

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,920
show cities fill in between here so you

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,680
can see it is

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,000
here inside a program plugged up

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
then go over again to other

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,560
program click on click back to

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,600
[Music]

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,480
this here over here to see where we can

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,759
find it

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,959
click here we see that

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,959
also again for that so definitely

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
and

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,600
around this side so you can see that

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,480
well what now that would expect our page

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,800
you can see that

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,079
the uber program go to extract the

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,279
inside and order this and

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,560
it's meaning i'm painting in black

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,639
page paragraph tag so let's

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,639
go back to our code and

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,839
take note of those um

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:56,320
um pass this generator

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,320
to let's use

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
it

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,520
so let's see what's

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
um

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,009
[Music]

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,799
okay so this

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,520
group has a lot of method if you click

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,120
those and

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,799
you click our tab to show us

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,080
different methods of um

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
which you can use for um extracting our

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,400
data for

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,919
the html document so

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,120
go to using find

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,559
find method find

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,840
what this does it's

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:09,280
extract this data

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,679
based on the tag being input based on

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,679
the tag

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,799
so for example we said soup dot find

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,160
let's look for anton it's unquote

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,360
right and see what see it

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,039
shows the first that's what's fine find

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,440
extra table first anchor tag in the html

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,440
document

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,880
so then you can also check

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
if you want to find all

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,600
all the uncle extract all the encounter

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,640
you can run this and

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,320
we'll be able to see so

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,160
these below are

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:03,280
these are the all the uncontagious

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,280
find all extracts all the uncontact

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
and the beauty beauty about this

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,559
beautiful source

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,120
is store them in the list

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,240
so this here is the opening square

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,919
bracket

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
and the

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
yeah this is the closest square back so

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,080
and it separates each

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,240
anchor tag so it's

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,679
find all extract all the anchor tag

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,760
and convert it to the list

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,799
if you click on length you'll be able to

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
find

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,960
the

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,559
[Music]

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,600
structure so that's

00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,039
that says we understand

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,360
now we inspect our page understand

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,480
what you're going to extract that the

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,520
uber profile is

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
in the order list and the meaning

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
to the

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
paragraph so

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,120
[Music]

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,120
let's find

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,720
on

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,840
[Music]

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,840
see you can see it just extracted

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,840
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,840
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:49,320
per page in the webpage you can see

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:52,390
he shows their future

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,390
[Music]

00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:02,240
so with this few um code i said i think

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,559
we can now go for that the

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
since we found we've done the step first

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,000
steps one

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,840
three by finding data we'll just check

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,679
so now we're going to write our code

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:18,480
to exactly write the code

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
run them and let's try the data so

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:31,520
then i created an empty list

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:35,360
which will take all the yoga program

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,000
in a which restricted

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:44,000
as a list the

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,280
english proverb the meaning

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,360
be extracted

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:55,760
from this empty hl empty list

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
so that's why i could take this now

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,200
since we understand that it's

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,730
[Music]

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,839
final

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,839
[Music]

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,840
find all on that

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
time

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,400
we've seen all i embedded

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,640
and would like to use like to use a for

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
loop

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,480
revolutionary constructing and after

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,480
extracting them

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,360
after i extracted them to be added into

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,000
this empty list

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,880
so that's what i introduced for all you

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,200
should find all the

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:18,080
empty type and i assigned

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:23,760
o n dot find l i that's the link type

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:27,039
for this

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,159
so which will go over i assigned the

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:37,840
google

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:37,840
global windows

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,400
so for ol instruct find

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,840
all um all at least

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,840
so every other page

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,400
after taking only this

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,960
which i did show you starting

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
with this

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,840
that's reason don't find

00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,869
[Music]

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
find

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,179
[Music]

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:55,200
will now extract only this

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,200
for each each

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,279
order for that

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,720
this stack estimator in this is

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:10,320
which we extracting that by

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
finding them so that's what this does

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,080
here

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
you prove up

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,039
extract only detects in this lifetime

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,520
so that's the first

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,840
the first tax

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,119
[Music]

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,600
[Music]

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,679
has already extracted them

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,880
everything as a string you see

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,559
then now we're going to go to

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,720
the paragraph

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:16,080
before the meaning to extracting so

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,880
you see you said

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,840
the meanings are inside an estimate

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,520
inside

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:27,120
paragraph time don't find

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,960
all will extract all the tags

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,550
the program tags in the statement

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,039
and we exist we saw that

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,400
[Music]

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,799
this paragraph tag here for one of the

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
meanings

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,039
all of them start and we don't need this

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,240
you don't need the meaning

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:55,279
and the column so this

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,400
um function this if

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:03,520
statements rather what it does is

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:07,120
it takes each um text

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,120
yes don't tell me to extract the text

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,240
and to start meaning

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,840
to understand that once only the text

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,399
detects around html tags

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,399
okay so

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,080
we want only the text that starts with

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,279
meaning

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,840
because a whole if you say

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
that's fine for

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,880
means foreign other content in this

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
webpage but we don't want

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,240
translation because translation

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,159
start paragraph or other elements that

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,360
are inside

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
the paragraph so translation between

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,840
that

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,840
um we could

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,679
it's for only meaning enough for that

00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,679
it will append

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,039
that

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,200
so this english which is the empty

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,320
um targeting those append paragraph

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,159
append the paragraph text to split so

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,159
for this this

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,600
um this code here what

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,080
does it it's split after dispatching all

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,080
the tags

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,840
and removing the paragraph and split

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
resistance

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,720
for better understanding

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,640
so but split

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,840
you split the each

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,279
uh sentences you split them you just put

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:13,840
them into two

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,840
so let me see

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,460
[Music]

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,840
don't find

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,609
[Music]

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:45,520
you see we want to move this

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,399
we want to move this all the meanings

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,960
because if it is tracked it's related to

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,640
extract

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
the stop if it's what it takes

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
type

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:23,840
do it

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,039
don't start

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
with

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
x

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
um

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:13,120
you said but this okay the if

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
the if statements

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
make we make it as a conditional

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,880
statement

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
from

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:47,840
so okay

00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,880
[Music]

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,880
so let's see

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
start

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,240
meaning

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:24,080
so it is true so if he starts with me

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:28,000
which is true he wants it

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:42,070
to split which is true

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:54,099
is true so we wanted to split

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:54,099
[Music]

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,120
so then you want

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:07,519
this one read the slice the method

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,039
to this is the first answer

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,519
in the in the list issue second one is

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,160
one

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,480
so to extract this and your stripe

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,679
[Music]

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,559
stripe also if this pronounces this

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,559
place yet

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,880
there is space before the before nemesis

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,360
so describe what the tribe was it

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,320
removes unwanted elements

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,320
unwanted element from the um

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,120
string that's what this

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,480
this splits and that's how this splits

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,200
then this analysis chemistry can come

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
about

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,440
in this place they will not append it in

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,840
the english

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,840
the emptiness the empty

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,559
which is english so that's what

00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,559
[Music]

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,050
[Music]

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
all

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,560
and that's by writing

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:45,200
the key and the value

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,960
the value will be the value

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,960
and here this string here is the

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,839
see

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,580
[Music]

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:28,839
so then we can save it and it still is

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:33,359
right within the rules

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,359
index import course

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,960
and if you run it we're going to save it

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,000
go to our file location you can get it

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
you can apply a machine to training to

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,960
understand

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:53,200
the language and the translation

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,560
so so that's the last step

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,520
which is my story data is required

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,480
so the main basic thing for in web

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,119
scripting is

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,839
you need to understand the url you need

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,760
to inspect the page first

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,040
you need to find data in this page

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,040
you can see the tag

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,839
