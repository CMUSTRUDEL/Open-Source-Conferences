Publication date: 2020-08-30
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Geospatial Information System (GIS) is a conceptualized framework that provides the ability to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data spatial and Geographic data. Python as a programming language has a lot of libraries which are used for different types of geospatial analysis and each of it has different strengths and limitations. In this talk we will be looking at building interesting and interactive geospatial visualisations using IpyLeaflet, how we could use Ipyleaflet widget to design our maps, creating single and multiple markers on map and exporting the interactive visualization in html.

hello good morning everyone

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,800
um my name is abimbola

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,880
um and today we'll be talking about um

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
a deep dive into geospatial

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,679
visualization

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,880
into um using high pi leaflet

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,880
okay a brief about myself

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,600
a bit about myself i'm a

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
data analyst at data science nigeria and

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
um

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,079
my major interests are in geospatial

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,320
analysis statistical modeling

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,800
and machine um i

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
and a quick breathe into what we'll be

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,320
doing today

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
um okay

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
we'll be looking into the bet of

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,439
geospatial analysis i'll talk about

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,200
creating basic maps with high pi

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,240
leaflets i will talk about how the

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
markers

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,720
valine ship files or geospatial data

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,320
on um the files on m

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,320
the base maps and we'll also play around

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:31,600
um some ipay leaflets we get

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:36,880
and we'll also be expecting um

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,320
maps into html all right

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,040
um okay

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
so yeah

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:53,119
tell them to special um analysis

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,399
um in 19 in 1854 there was this guy

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,000
called jon snow he

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:04,880
and during this period of time

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,119
a um cholera outbreak happened and

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,160
there was this need for serious and

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,640
attention

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
yeah such that the the disease is

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,760
spreading

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,560
and um this um during that period of

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,520
time and people believe that um

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
the um the disease has been spread

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
through

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,959
hair like it is

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,120
but this guy who is also

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
recognized as one of the fathers of

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
epidemiology

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
says it is actually nuts and hair bone

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,160
disease

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,200
so you desire to like draw

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,239
these streets and everything in a paper

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
where my

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
cursor is something like this and at the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,400
end of the day after drawing

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,120
the major occurrences by location

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
on that sheet of paper he was able to

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
understand that

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,239
there was a pump there was a

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,599
water pump that is supplying water to

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
those people

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,239
in that particular environment that is

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
damage and

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
has some lot of issues and that is where

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,720
the

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,280
um disease is circulating and

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
with that they they were able to um they

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
were able to

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,840
understand the fact that um

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
they were able to understand that it is

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
the problem and that is one of the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
powers of visualization

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,000
m and geospatial visualization okay

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,640
so um i pi leaflet is like a bridge

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
between um

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,280
leaflet.js and um

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
jupiter environment you such that you'll

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
be able to

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,439
use your mapping capabilities on jupiter

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,280
lab or jupiter nodes local

00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,480
yeah so let's go straight into

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,080
um the work of today okay

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,920
so like i've said um my name is abimbola

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,840
and um the tutorial for today will be

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,519
found on my github just go to github.com

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,160
slash holla value 254

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:24,479
con 20 online

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,720
okay first and foremost i would like

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
the format of geospatial data

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
can come in different from percy it can

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
come

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,199
in text which is probably

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,520
csv it can come in um

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,320
it can come in text it can come in shape

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,919
files

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,479
it can come in um open

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,800
we have open streets map osm files we

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,160
have rasters those active

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,000
we have um geojson we have json and the

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
rest of them

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,720
um okay based on the

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,800
um um i based on ipi leaflet

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,840
to install it i think going through the

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
documentation

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,440
will be the best you can actually use

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
ppinstall

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,600
probably we should check that hope

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,479
coming i think my network

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,440
um okay you can actually use pip install

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
to install ipad leaflet on your jupiter

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
notebook

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,120
or anaconda environment and i

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,000
am as that as of

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
today i don't think gm ipad leaflet is

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
working on

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,919
um google collab so it's you might not

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,960
be able to use it on

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,840
google um collab platform

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,840
okay so straight down to

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,960
one of the major works of today which is

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
um base maps and ipad

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,639
and they are different one of the beauty

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
of ipad leaflet is that they are they

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,639
are different

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,280
um it has different grip

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,319
maps which you can play around with

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,800
different for example i have like

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:22,400
almost 12 or 15 base maps here

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,319
that we can actually play around with

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,759
and okay let me just run the code

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,680
coming that we can actually

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,759
play around with we can see

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,880
we can see um we can see

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,680
osm we can see

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,759
we can see eric's world map it has

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
google maps too

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,960
we have ike bike do that just

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,160
basically base maps i'm coming my

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,000
network is

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:02,720
my internet is somehow so it's coming up

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,800
now all right

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
okay so these are

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,840
these are the kind of map i pi leaflet

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
base maps for example let me go to what

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
imagery

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,680
what imagery these are that this is a

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,039
very good example

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
we have there is this

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,560
this is another one

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,759
we can use word street maps too

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,520
so basically these are just the major

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,039
um types of them base maps that we can

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,160
play around with

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,160
in ipad leaflet

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,160
oh okay

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,720
creating just a basic map

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,759
by default um ipad leaflet

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,280
works with um i think open street map

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,919
and by default

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,520
so a map okay if we want to create the

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,000
map the first thing i'll do is

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,039
i'll import ipy leaflets after

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,120
installing

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:23,280
in your jubilee notebook or jupiter lab

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,840
and after that okay from ipy leaflet i'm

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,720
importing

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,399
map and my basic map um

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,360
is i'm defining it to be um

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
okay my basic map so i'm bringing

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
writing a function that

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:45,600
to create a map using a zoom of

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,320
four this will be the way you want um

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,760
the way you want um your map to display

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,279
whether it is

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,440
how how closer you want it to

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
okay for example let me run this i'm

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,480
using this as

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,480
with zoom of 4 and we can see

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
we can see that

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,320
playing the map of africa

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,160
okay uh okay let me use um

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,800
zoom on sue

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
is the most

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,519
it's what i mean by zoom

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
you can see that

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
so it depends on the way you want it to

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,760
the way you want

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
scale it that's a

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,600
how it comes okay

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,040
so yeah basic map with

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,800
different base maps okay we've talked

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,080
about different um

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,519
base maps there we

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
we we've talked about different ipi

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,320
leaflet

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
so now creating it

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,320
since we've imported and we in the

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,079
cell we've import ipa leaflet and we've

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,200
created a map so now what i want to do

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,959
here is just to create a basic map

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,240
using this eric's word

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,839
to put a home up

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,079
as a base map for my map so for example

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
if i

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,720
okay it's coming if i load this

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,760
you find out that it's

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,800
that we've loaded before so it's a a

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,440
specific

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
a particular

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,880
app which i have created and the

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,279
difference between these

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,320
this one is using openstreetmap the

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,279
first

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
base map is using openstreetmap as is

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
basemap

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,839
but here but i'm back that is by default

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,839
but here i have specified

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
that my the basement

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:25,680
eric's what's up map so now

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:30,160
and a good example of it

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:34,079
let me use another for

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,079
um oh okay

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
and the base map this is another base

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
map

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,000
okay this is another b

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
okay let me try this

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
statement column

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,839
last one

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
i'm coming

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,720
okay we can see so

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,720
this is how to set up maps

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:39,839
in ipad leaflet and we can also adjust

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,839
our zoom level

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,399
i want to add a marker of a particular

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,920
location

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
on the map so now the first was to

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
import

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,920
from ipyth letter import map and also

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,480
import marker

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:10,320
then geocoder

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,680
and now i am trying to

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
okay now my location i had to code my

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
location

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,200
using geocoda.osm

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,680
to be a chersey university ghana um okay

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
it's

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
a university i love i have been there

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,480
once and

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,959
okay and i i also

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,600
function that i'll take the latitude and

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,160
longitude

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,600
longitude of that particular location

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,959
so what this will do is this will use

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,279
an openstreetmap um

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:50,959
api to support me to use

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,399
planning to to pull out um

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,880
the location at chelsea university

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,040
and this function here will take the

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,639
latitude and longitude

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,000
of that particular location

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,680
and now by creating my map it's

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,880
it's it's taking

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,839
it and here in um

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
i'm also creating a marker

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,839
it is the location and by running g's

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:44,480
okay by running this

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:48,720
i have my map displayed

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,360
this is the location this is my location

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
so if i want to change my location for

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,199
example

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,519
i want to change it to yaba in lagos

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,480
state

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,480
that's nigeria i'll just clear this off

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
and now i'll give it jabba

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,519
lagers and uh

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:41,839
and i'm going to change the title

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:41,839
yeah actually a place in lagos

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
this

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
okay then my plot

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
okay this is this

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,880
let me just let me try and zoom in

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,880
so we can have a clear view

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,040
yeah we can seats and lagos so that is

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,399
set map okay

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,440
a bm single marker in ipad leaflet

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,880
okay adding multiple markers now yeah

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,240
uh what i did was i i actually

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,800
out of source for data i like

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,440
okay the the data i used here was gotten

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,440
from greatly you can check it out

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,959
it dot gov dot hang g it's an open

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,160
so um openm

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,959
data bank you can get some

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
geospatial data and it is actually

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,240
basically nigerian data so

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,679
so so um i

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,400
i got the location of all um of schools

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
in lagos

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
uganda states delta state acquired

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,039
cardinal and i

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
matched them when you check my if you

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,880
check my

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,720
if you want you can check my

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,079
um my github in this same

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,039
python africa 2020

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,120
you will see the um theta cleaning

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,720
process which i have done

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,760
which i used in merging all those

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,960
data together and what i did was

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,640
sorry if i don't use the center level

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,080
it will it will will it's um the map

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,120
will not come

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,799
to the in general so i

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,160
had to indicate a particularity here

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,559
so that it will zoom polar level so i

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
used

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,679
the longitude and lag nigeria

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,120
so that it will it to zoom to that level

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,480
i brought my data in and

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,480
from there my the row of

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
my longitude and the latitude the colon

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,559
of my longitudinal latitude

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,559
and the name so

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
my

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,880
i'm coming the internet is i think is

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,840
the entire

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,960
okay cool by running these i have

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,799
oh sorry by running i have the longitude

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
and latitude

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,480
um the multiple markers for example

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,400
looking at this now

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,200
this is a particular government signs

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,640
sorry okay this is a school i think in

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,039
cardona

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:14,080
also there's a

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,120
let me come down to what's

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:22,320
uh college of education

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:26,400
and interstate so that is

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,679
um all right so now

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,559
let's see another thing

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,240
we can do with an ipy leaflet this is

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,400
the

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,559
overlapping data

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
overlaying special data on ipad leaflet

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,200
and

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,440
there was um a shape file i saw a geo

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,039
json file

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,720
with uh um

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,160
africa africa percent

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,760
and i i you can see just

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,039
as i did in the multiple marker i also

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,159
centered

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,200
my um on

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,480
a center diploma i'm coming

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,080
i sent to be

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,360
on um africa to be

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,720
africa elongated and latitude of africa

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,640
okay did was

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,880
i imported my json file and i overlaid

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:33,200
using the specific style um

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,200
guide and by running this

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:49,840
all right by running these

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
by running design

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,480
this

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,480
we can the map okay

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,960
it's i'm using a base okay i'm using

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,320
opposite

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,720
base map so this is another example and

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,039
with this we can

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,080
you can also zoom out

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,360
yeah so this is our kingdom

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:31,200
okay okay okay so cool

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:35,600
let's move to the next

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,960
okay creating um

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:43,440
platinum i pi leaflet

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:47,840
so i'm actually using the african ship

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,880
um african geojson data

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,720
plotter earlier on i used

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,320
that and um what i did was i

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,760
had the um population of african

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,440
countries

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,480
i with the data i imported is csv file

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,640
and combining it together

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
i

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,159
combining this together i

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,880
i have um okay combining this together

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,440
we have

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,240
something like this sorry i think

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,799
combining this together we we and

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
running

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,640
this okay let me just run

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
explain it

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:42,640
because um let me just run it

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
we can see

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,240
the map of africa and this um

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,240
this indicator

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,559
the um the population of these african

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
countries

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:03,120
and in um

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,280
the way it should color the legend based

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,559
on this

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,840
function you can see if you can see my

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,159
cursor here

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:17,440
and with that i was able to like

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
a match the two and the the african

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,120
shape file

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,280
and um the population data

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,200
i was able to match them together and at

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
the end of the day i was able to build

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
something

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,360
like this something like this

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,480
um okay so the next thing

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,880
we'll look into is just which is i think

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,480
the

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,799
last part of this session is um

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,279
play i um and with these twos you

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,000
you'll be able to do some little amazing

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,120
things

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,480
stuff that are amazing okay

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,600
for example i am

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
creating a basic okay a basic high pi

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,200
leaflet

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,679
and here

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,679
coming

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,360
so the first thing i did here

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
was to create a basic map like a basic

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,559
map control

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
a basic map control that one is

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,039
different from

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,159
i first did and here you can select the

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,520
particular type

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,760
of music map you want as the base map

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,120
the beast map you want for example i

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
choose

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,840
the second open streets my black and

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,840
white

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,880
it will change it should change to

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,880
change

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,520
okay let me try them yeah it has changed

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,279
i my internet is just too slow okay open

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,200
streets my black and white

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:04,320
um the whatstreet's map

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,640
so with these i was able to create okay

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,159
something like this to show for you to

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,440
just select

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,880
from there something so

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,919
another tools you you can create here

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,600
you other

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,799
it's the draw control probably you want

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,840
to draw something

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,840
on your map okay

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
it's

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:46,320
so i'm in

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,320
cool as a draw control i'm adding

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,799
so when you since i since my map is

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
there

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
he scrolls

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,279
so now we can see that the draw

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,640
is here now

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,760
before we can see it's now here so for

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,760
example if i want to

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,799
i can actually draw

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:29,679
we can see then

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,240
okay so this is actually

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:39,840
part of it let me use another one let me

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,840
use another control

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:52,280
let me just cancel this and use another

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:55,390
control let me use this

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,390
[Music]

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:07,840
okay that

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,840
um again i just press my

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,799
oh cool so the next thing

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,799
we can okay

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,600
i'm not done with the drawing yet

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,039
let me just press finish

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,960
okay i have it some kind of

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,720
triangle on my

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,200
i have just drawn a

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,200
my map let me let's move forward

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,399
that is for such m for

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,279
um this square and line

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
and rectangles we can draw stuffs like

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,600
that

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,640
so now i want to initiate the size

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,919
we can also initiate the search control

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,919
let me just run this

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,600
and after i me let me go back here

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,919
you can see that the search button is

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,840
here it's actually

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:19,360
and we can actually use it now

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,360
okay for example okay let me just type

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,080
africa

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,200
okay these are just

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,880
some which

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,880
i can go to and that is

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,520
how it will so let me just

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,520
let us try

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:49,360
this is the full um control we

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,559
get you can let's

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,000
a full control reject

00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:00,000
um i think it should be there

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,200
i thought we judge em contains um

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,320
um almost all of the things we need

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,360
we've been hiding

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,600
one by one so it depends on what's

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,399
okay the africa um something that i

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,720
searched

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:19,120
this is it this is it

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,120
um let's continue

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,840
okay

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,799
yet and also i think

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,720
sakumaka yeah

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,440
this circle okay let me just try and

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
initiate it

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,840
and i've added it to them we can let me

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
check

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:55,840
yeah i use it

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:09,840
okay i'm trying to to draw the circle

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,840
trying i'm trying to locate it i'm sorry

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
okay

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:26,880
so i use a particular location like this

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,000
this is a circle i'm trying to draw it

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,840
i know it's the internet is here is bad

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,080
and it's making everything slow

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
down

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,919
okay i think i this is zits on the map

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,640
then i think the last thing here is

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
splitting our map into two probably

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,840
using different base

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,840
map so again let me just

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,039
splitting our map into two here we are

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,399
trying to split our map into

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,720
two different parts okay so you can see

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,679
from the function i i

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,200
i import them the base maps i import

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,720
these baptized and i

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,919
use the split map control which is

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,799
in high pi leaflet use the right to be

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,080
a particular with a particular beast map

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,640
the left with particular

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,840
briefs map and after run it

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
i have this

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:37,679
let me just go back so that we can

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,679
earp and this is it

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,880
yeah this is actually the map so we can

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,399
see these are two different

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,240
maps yep

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,360
and lastly we

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,559
export it as an html

00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:01,840
the first map of them the

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,840
idea with them

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,600
we can see

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,679
the the

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,760
file and i think that

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,360
i talk if you want to connect with me

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,360
