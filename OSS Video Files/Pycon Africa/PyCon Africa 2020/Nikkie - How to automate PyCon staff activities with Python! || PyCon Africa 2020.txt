Title: Nikkie - How to automate PyCon staff activities with Python! || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-29
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	This talk is case studies about automation with Python in PyCon Japan staff activities.
I will give this talk in English for 30 minutes.

In the PyCon JP staff activities, we use a lot of tools such as Slack and Google Drive.
I introduce two examples of how Python solved some of the things that I felt were not cool with the tool.

Target Audience
Intermediate User
(I will introduce several third-party packages in this talk, so beginners might feel difficult to understand)

This talk requires experience of writing automation scripts in Python, using some kind of package.
It would be more understandable if you have experience of automating the staff about Slack or Google Drive with Python, which I handle in talks, but not required.
Knowledge about the staff of PyCon JP will be supposed to be unnecessary.

Audience take-away
- How to post a message to Slack with Python
- How to do the above regularly using AWS Lambda
- How to manipulate Google Drive documents with Python
- A series of ways to manipulate Google Drive documents from Slack (via Python scripts deployed on AWS)
- Knowledge of what the PyCon JP staff is doing
