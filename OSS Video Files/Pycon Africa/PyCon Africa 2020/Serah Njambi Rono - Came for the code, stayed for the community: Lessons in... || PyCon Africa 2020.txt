Title: Serah Njambi Rono - Came for the code, stayed for the community: Lessons in... || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	In this talk, I will share how The Carpentries employs its collaboration-driven ethos and applies it in various aspects that have contributed to the growth of the community to a 65,000+ member-strong initiative that primarily interacts and collaborates online. In this talk, I will cover  our collaborative approach to code-of-conduct creation, community values definition, core resources co-creation, annual voting for community leaders, resources for effective online collaboration that we use, etc. I will also speak about challenges we have faced over the years, those we have overcome and how, and those that remain untacked, or are a work in progress. By the end of this talk, I hope to inspire other communities in the audience, and spark good conversations about strategies for building and sustaining Python communities.
