Title: Serah Njambi Rono - Came for the code, stayed for the community: Lessons in... || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	In this talk, I will share how The Carpentries employs its collaboration-driven ethos and applies it in various aspects that have contributed to the growth of the community to a 65,000+ member-strong initiative that primarily interacts and collaborates online. In this talk, I will cover  our collaborative approach to code-of-conduct creation, community values definition, core resources co-creation, annual voting for community leaders, resources for effective online collaboration that we use, etc. I will also speak about challenges we have faced over the years, those we have overcome and how, and those that remain untacked, or are a work in progress. By the end of this talk, I hope to inspire other communities in the audience, and spark good conversations about strategies for building and sustaining Python communities.

so welcome

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
everybody my name is sarah rono i am

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
currently the

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,760
director of community at the carpentries

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
and i'll tell you the carpentries is in

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,279
a little bit

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
my background is computer in computer

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,800
science i am a computer scientist by

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,920
training

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,440
and over the last seven years

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
i have worked in different open source

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
projects

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
as a back-end developer and a front-end

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,320
developer

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
and somewhere along the way i found

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
myself

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,480
involved in community organizing and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
community wrangling

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,000
and so that's what i've primarily done

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,719
as a developer advocate and developer

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
for

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,120
several years before i joined the

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,440
cabinetries i worked

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,799
with kund for africa in nairobi for a

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
couple of years

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
and then opened knowledge foundation

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,080
which is based in the uk

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,640
for a couple of years and then joined

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
the carpentries last year in january

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,759
um yes and so i interfaced with

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
communities in technical spaces quite a

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,560
bit

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
you can find me on email

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,360
sarahcarpentrees.org

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
you can also find me on twitter sarah

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
renault

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
and i'm happy to engage with you in

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
whatever

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
way i can on whatever platform you find

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
me

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
so today i will be sharing um some of

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
the lessons that i've picked up in the

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
pursuit of community sustainability over

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
the years

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,159
and particularly in open source settings

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,240
where people come with a need which is

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
to solve a technical problem so they

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
come for the code

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,079
and then if there's a great community

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
around it they probably stay

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,479
and contribute and continue to use the

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,000
tool and things like that

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
um okay so a little bit about the

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
carpentries

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,160
um on your extreme left and you will see

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,319
a sort of timeline

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,080
that sort of stops um between

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,080
right before 2019 um so the carpentry

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,760
started a long time ago

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,879
and when it started um it was

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
um software carpentry was the primary

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,280
project

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
that started in 1998 um set up by greg

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
wilson

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,680
and friends and then so what they wanted

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
to do at that time was greg wilson

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
realized

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
he was teaching computer science but

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,920
then a lot of these skills

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,040
were really um well the resources that

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
existed weren't very easy for people who

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,959
are from nantech

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
backgrounds to you know take them on and

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
use them in their work

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
but he wanted to change that so he set

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
up software carpentry

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,560
and then a little after 2014 um data

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,599
carpentry was set up by tracy teal

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,360
and friends to cater to a slightly

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,239
different audience than

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
greg wilson's and then library carpentry

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
was then formed

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,319
but where our story starts as the cap

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,159
entries is early 2018 when

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,000
software carpentry data carpentry and

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,720
library carpentry became

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
one big thing and um they named

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,760
themselves the carpentries

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
um and so what the cap entries is it's a

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
non-profit

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
that brings together technologists and

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,680
researchers

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
and scientists and information

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
librarians

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,640
for the purpose of imparting

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
foundational

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,280
code foundational coding and data

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
science skills

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
primarily to researchers and information

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,239
librarians around the world

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,959
so we develop lessons primarily in

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
r and python they're all open source

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
they're on our github page

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,879
and we'll talk a little bit a bit about

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,519
that on a github organized

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
organization i'm sorry and anyone can

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
access them

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,799
and use them but to encourage people to

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
come into workshops where they

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,920
learn with other people and are taught

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
by

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,639
instructors from their carpentries so we

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,400
have member organizations in the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
carpentries who then

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
once they become members it means that

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
the carpentries can support them to run

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
this python and

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
our workshops in the institutions um and

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,000
so we have 85 member organizations we've

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
had 85 to date

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,840
um and in that time we've been able to

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
reach over 68 000 learners so people

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,800
who've taught

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
who've turned up in these workshops and

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,479
learned

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
um and had these foundational skills

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,440
imparted on them

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,560
and we have over 2700 instructors to

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
thank for

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
all the 2700 plus workshops that have

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,919
been run

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,880
um to date and we've at least run a

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
workshop in

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,000
in each of the continents and we've been

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,039
to 61 countries to date

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
um so that's a brief overview it's a lot

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,720
of numbers

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,600
um but i i hope it gives you an idea of

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
what the carpentries is and what we do

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,199
and um where we've come from over the

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
years

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,720
and then this map um tells

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,800
a better story and i really love it

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,919
because it shows the places where we've

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
done

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,240
a great job to date and places where we

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,520
really need to

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,160
do more um so i will explain this map

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
um so the countries that are shaded in

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
purple

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039
dark blue and dark green those are

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,560
countries where

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,759
we've run between one workshop and

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,680
100 workshops so purple is maybe between

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,039
1 and 10 workshops

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,400
and then dark blue is maybe between 15

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,039
and 80 and then green is somewhere

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,319
between

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,800
80 and um

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
and then the places you see shaded in a

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
lighter green

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,919
um so places like canada

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,840
and australia those are places where

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,880
we've run between 200

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,080
and 400 workshops to date

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,240
and new zealand as well and then yellow

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
are the countries where well it's mostly

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,800
the states where we've been able to

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,440
run over 500 workshops to to date

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
and then the sad story is that the

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
country is shaded

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
in gray are places where we haven't been

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,039
able to

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
run any workshop at all so there are

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
researchers and

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,319
information librarians in these

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,280
countries that could benefit from the

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
resources

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
and the the lessons the open lessons

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,560
that the cap entries has

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,400
but um because of different constraints

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,919
we really haven't been to

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
uh been able to run workshops there yet

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,520
um

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,880
yes and then

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,280
um this is the team

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
the carpentry is called team as it looks

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,800
right now

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,960
they starting nova soon to b14 there's

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,560
one more community number joining the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,520
core team

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,440
and what this team does is because the

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,960
carpentries is a community-led

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,280
organization and all these beautiful

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
numbers that you see are primarily the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,800
effort of

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
a community rather than the core team

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,080
what this team does

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,520
is they build infrastructure

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,160
they set up frameworks they fundraise

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,639
in a way that helps to support different

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
initiatives that community members run

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,599
in the carpentries

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,800
there are really wonderful lots um

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,000
so today we are going to talk about

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,160
incentives recognition um

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
and retention um and different

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
strategies around

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,479
incentives and retention and recognition

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,440
that help to sustain

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
a community and primarily one that is

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,440
global

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,840
and online fast like the carpentries is

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
um so as you start to do that i'd love

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
to hear from you

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
in chat um if you can take 30 seconds to

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
share

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,199
and think about any community that

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
you're actively involved in

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
or that you're really that you really

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,039
look up to

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
and admire even from afar and what are

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,399
the kinds of things

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
in that community that motivate or

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
encourage people

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,839
um to keep coming back and doing the

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
things that they do in that community

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
you can just type out in chat and it

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
doesn't have to be

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,839
it can be as short as you want it to be

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
can be as long as you want it to be

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,640
oh that's really great david um great to

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
see

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,440
actually teach workshops um in saudi

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,519
arabia

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,000
k-a-u-s-d thanks for sharing

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
so anyone want to share the incentives

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
that they've seen in different

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,080
communities

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,200
as i wait on you i can advance to the

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,880
next slide i will read chat as i see

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
things come up

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
so in the carpentries the things that

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,320
have incentivized our community to come

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
back time and again

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,399
some of the ones that we've observed

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,440
have been that we have

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,240
a shared goal and that means that

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
um there is a clear understanding that

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,320
um the mission

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
um and and what brings people together

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,839
in our community is to teach

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,920
foundational coding and data science

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,959
skills to researchers and librarians

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,360
worldwide

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,720
and so people who are willing to be

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
involved in this work

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
um can plug in at any point and this

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240
brings people together

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,160
quite a bit and then we also have an

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,200
elaborate code of conduct

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,040
which sort of establishes um the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,839
expected behaviors

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
in our community and on the right side

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,320
they took a screenshot

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,680
of the too long dentured version of it

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,079
we encourage people to show courtesy and

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
respect to each other to use welcoming

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,360
and inclusive language to be respectful

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,160
of different viewpoints and experiences

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,920
um and also to gracefully accept

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
constructive criticism which is

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,320
difficult

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,360
um so this code of conduct governs the

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,360
online and in personal spaces where the

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
carpentries meet

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
and it's shared at the beginning of

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
every meeting

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
so people have a place to go to in case

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
they need to

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
check if something that happened was out

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
of line

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
or to find out how to report things and

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,279
things like that

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,360
um in chat um kojo says

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,959
i'm part of the jungle and python

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,279
communities in the us

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,320
we put a lot of emphasis on making the

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,519
community as inclusive as possible

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,760
at coast in saudi arabia we have started

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,680
offering completion certificates for our

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
workshops that's really great people

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,600
have something to show

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,480
um and also we send post-workshop

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,279
feedback

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,440
from which is required to be returned in

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,959
order to get credit for attending so

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
that's david

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,120
and then nikhil says in some of the

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
communities i'm a part of we

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
try to do pair programming sessions so

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,519
that the senior and more experienced

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
folks can help the ones getting started

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,680
i really love this

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
um it's it's a form of mentoring and

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,399
it's

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
it's exceptional i love it um

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,560
i hope i said your name right says it is

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
part of our python communities here in

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,839
namibia

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
one of our community and it is an

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,639
instructor i guess you mean

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,120
the carpentries as a member okay

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
thank you thank you all for sharing um

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
so and then

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,920
other than the shared goal the elaborate

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
code of conduct

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,160
all the resources that are developed in

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,440
the carpentries are

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,079
licensed under the cc by license

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
and the the available for everyone to

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,320
access

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,839
to audit on github to suggest changes

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,320
or to ask questions about and we also

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,120
you know use apart from using github

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
issues

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
um to audit these things we have regular

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
community discussions where people can

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,720
come and talk about

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
a specific lesson or general topics and

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,839
decide

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
how to improve resources in the

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
countries

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
to cater to different contexts as we go

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,519
along

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,320
and then we also have community-led

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
governance

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,680
and initiatives so for example

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,920
we have an executive council that runs

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
all things that are governance related

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,399
in the carpentries

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,800
and all of them are community members

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
some

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,440
are elected and some are appointed by

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,000
previous executive councils and then

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
we currently are running a seven-week

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,320
conference called capentrycon

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
it started in mid-july it's going

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,279
through to the end of august and it was

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,000
organized solely by community members

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,519
it's seven weeks long because it's a

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
global community

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
time zones are going to be hectic so we

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
decided to do

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,839
sessions a couple of sessions a week at

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
different times across the world you can

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,639
check their website schedule

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,920
to see how we spread them across the

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
board but it's really

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
it's been really good so far and it's

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
allowed me

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,920
um to be able to come to pico and

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,079
in the middle of carpentry contest so

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,079
that's great um and then

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,040
there's lots of opportunities for

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,560
professional development for

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,880
our community members we want them to

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,600
come in as one thing and yes they will

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
gain

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,079
um from the lessons that they go through

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,639
and the computational skills that they

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,519
gain

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
but also um for them to find ways to

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
grow

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
over time in the community so like

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
someone else said

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,399
peer mentorship is something that's

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,839
really important to us and we have a

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
mentoring program

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,680
we also entrust lessons that are used in

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,880
the carpentries to community members

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,040
so charge of maintaining the

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
repositories around these lessons and

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
that means

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
um any issues that are raised they they

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
will be leaders they will make decisions

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,639
around

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,519
how to tackle the different issues um

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
how to

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
change aspects of the lessons and in a

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,800
way that benefits the community things

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,600
like that

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
and then we also have a

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,800
collaboration-driven ethos

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,760
and we use consensus-driven um

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,160
progression to make um decisions many

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,040
decisions in the community

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,160
and if you check the conversations repo

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,639
in the carpentries

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,720
go to the issues section you will see

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,480
the discussions that happen around

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,279
different things that we need to make

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
decisions

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,680
on and on the right i've taken

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,079
screenshots

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,760
of you know people talking about

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,079
mentoring groups

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
and showcasing the work they've done

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,040
with their mentors

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,600
um at the end of a mentoring period

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,399
um and you know lessons from being a

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
maintainer

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,920
and how it's helped people grow and

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,199
things like that all of these

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,480
are in the cup and she's blog um

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,279
and then it's one big community

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
but there's many ways for people to be

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,800
engaged

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
um one of the core values that the

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,480
carpentries has

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,079
is that we value all contributions and

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
we're really keen on that

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,639
and so if you only have an hour and

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,199
you're able to host a session

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,240
that's a great way to contribute and and

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,040
we value that

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,959
equally um you know to the person who's

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,199
doing maintenance because you know

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,279
maybe the institution is supporting part

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,440
of their time for carpentry's work

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,360
or if you're able to review some of the

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
lessons or give feedback once you've

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
gone through them

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,880
or if you're able to you know ask

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,199
questions in slack

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,160
or respond to other people's questions

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,480
or

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
brainstorm with other people all of that

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,480
matters to us

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
and there's many different

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,000
sub-communities what i mean by this

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,160
is so the carpentries is one big

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
organization doing a lot of different

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,720
things

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,360
so you can join the maintainer sub

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
community or you can sign up to run

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,639
workshops

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
in which case you'd be an instructor or

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
you can sign

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,560
up to mentor instructors or to train

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,040
those

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
instructors so there's many different

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
ways

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,560
to to be involved there's also

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,360
committees and task forces that

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,440
do specific things like organize

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
carpentry con 2020

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,400
or oversee the code of conduct and

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,079
things like that

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,679
and then allowing people different ways

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,400
to plug in around the same project

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
so for example if we put out a request

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
for comments

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,400
most times we recognize that some people

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,199
might not be comfortable to share things

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,760
like on github with their name

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,840
attached to it or in the mailing list

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
with the email attached to it

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
so we can sometimes put out two versions

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
of the same thing

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,760
so you will decide if you wanted to use

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,720
you know forms to give us feedback

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,039
or uh use the public github issue for

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,600
example for feedback

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,080
um or in a call like this and so you

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
know how

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,760
zoom works everyone is able to mute and

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,320
enrich themselves

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,880
to contribute we recognize that not

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,280
everyone is in a position to do that

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,400
um so we always have a collaborative

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,120
notes document

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
going on um like to accompany their

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
calls we have

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,679
and that means even if i'm muted and

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,919
with my video off

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,240
and they have contributions i can type

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,520
them in anonymously we use something

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
called etherpad

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
that allows you to type in anonymously

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
or to

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,919
you know label your contributions by

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,480
naming yourself in the dark

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,480
and then you know people can go into

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,919
discussions and take time to think about

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,840
what they've heard and learnt and if

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,320
they want to share by way of writing

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,640
rather than by hosting a discussion

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
they're welcome to do that so multiple

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
ways to be

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
involved so that everyone is included in

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,080
a way that makes sense to them

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,440
um yeah so that's incentives

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,919
and then um i want to talk briefly about

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,640
the kinds of recommendation strategies

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
that we've tried at the carpentries

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,480
and later on i'll also share the

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
challenges we're facing around all these

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,960
strategies

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,760
um so recognition to to draw a bit of a

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
distinction

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,600
from incentives is you know

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,160
the acknowledgement of how important the

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,760
quality

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,919
of work that someone has done is and

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
taking the time to express gratitude

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,360
show appreciation for it

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,080
um thank you joseph for sharing

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
the carpentry's website in chat i

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,799
appreciate that

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
um so let's talk about a bit about the

00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,720
recognition

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,720
trade and i will start with one that

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
um we did invent that wasn't the best

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
way to do

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,679
and i'll explain why so um we

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,400
wanted to recognize the efforts that our

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,440
community members were putting in

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,919
and in a community that has give or take

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
about

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,640
2000 active participants

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,679
in slack at least and several hundred in

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,880
different places

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
at any given point

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,280
we set up community awards

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,480
and after 2018

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,640
we had to stop running our community

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,880
awards and it wasn't because

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
they weren't a good way to recognize the

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
work of people

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,360
but in an open community in an um

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
where everyone is contributing of their

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,679
time um

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,880
in different ways as they are able to um

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,600
the people who were awarded um felt that

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
you know

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
they were given recognition for work

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
that

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,360
a whole community did and so it puts

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,799
them on the spot

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,760
it felt like you know it um

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,840
it brought friction to some of the

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
relationships that people had in our

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,159
community

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,159
but also it's um

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,480
it it gave um

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
preeminence to i don't know how to say

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,760
this but

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,720
yeah we sort of in the end said to

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,600
people inadvertently that the visible

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
work you do

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,799
is valued more and so what happens to

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,760
the person who's shown up to

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,240
community calls all year or several

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
times

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
and taken notes that have helped people

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,559
who aren't in the call to follow through

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
with the notes and still be at par with

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,640
what is happening in the community what

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
happens to the invisible work that

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,840
people are doing in the community

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,880
so this wasn't a really good way to run

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,520
community recognition and so we decided

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
to stop

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,960
it after hearing from the our days

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,559
at the end of 2018 and so what did we do

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,400
instead in 2019 we decided

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
there's a lot that goes on in the

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,559
community that

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,200
um the ten of us in the core team at the

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,799
time

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,440
now 13 soon to be 14 um had no

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,600
idea about right because we weren't in

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
every call that was happening we weren't

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,799
in every

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,679
repository where discussions were

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,080
happening we weren't privy to everything

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,480
so we reached out to different community

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,520
members in the different sub-communities

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,679
that they're in and we told them so

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,840
you're a maintainer or you are a

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,919
regional coordinator or you've been to

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,960
the code of conduct committee

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,840
um you know or you've been an instructor

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,919
in a workshop

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200
and you've worked with others do you

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,880
mind telling us

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
some of the things that have stood out

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
for you in your work with sarah in the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,760
work with joseph in iraq

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,200
david um in the last year and so

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,760
people wrote lots and lots of content so

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
we give

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
people three or four coins questions in

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,080
a google doc

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,679
and then people went away and wrote

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,559
about all the different ways they

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,600
collaborated and what that meant to them

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,720
and so we published that in a series of

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,840
i think it's

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,200
um 20 or 19 blog posts in december of

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,280
last year

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,440
and it's community members saying thank

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,159
you to each other for very specific

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,240
things

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
sometimes with links sometimes with

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,679
photos

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,720
and it's just a really beautiful thing

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,919
and that that

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,159
came out of this and out of a really

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,400
intense lesson that we picked up from

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
running the awards the year before

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
and so this is something we'll continue

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,640
to do um

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,640
and that we have a hashtag for on on

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
twitter which is green stickies so in

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,000
the carpentries we use

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,360
green and red stickies to communicate um

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,360
in a workshop setting so um you know the

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,320
sticky notes that you have and they're

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,080
really smart

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,919
small and squarish and they come in

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,919
different colors

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,000
and so the green sticky is used to

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
communicate to an instructor that as a

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
person learning

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
i have no questions i am at par with

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,520
what you're sharing

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
at the front of our class and so i will

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,120
stick it to the front of my screen where

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
they can see it from the front of the

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,760
classroom

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,640
and then as if i have a question i will

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,720
put a red sticky on my

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
laptop where they can see it and someone

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,000
will come around to help me without

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,000
disrupting the session

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
so yeah green stickies are the things we

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
are grateful for

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,919
um in the real world too and so that

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,000
that um became a thing that we will

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,159
carry on with us and it was a really

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,720
good exercise we had

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
from our community and then to

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,720
continually thank

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
people to not wait for december of every

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
year so that

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,279
people say thank you but um as often as

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,480
we can to recognize that the work that

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,520
people are doing

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,240
so that means um you know that instead

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,640
of sarah who's director of community

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,799
standing every time to speak for

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
um the work that people are doing in the

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,080
community

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,799
it's passing on the microphone to them

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,720
actively

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,960
um and so that's what we're trying to do

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,120
with things like carpentry con at home

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,000
but even when cap and chicon isn't

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,279
happening

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,520
it's me facilitating the setting up of

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,840
you know a community discussion

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
where a community member can come and

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,880
speak about

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
the ideas they've had and then

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,039
facilitate a session where others

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,279
also share their own ideas and brings

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,000
about collaboration so passing on the

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,159
mic

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,159
um rather than you know speaking for

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,120
people or on behalf of people

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
all the time um encouraging people to

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,000
write

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,120
and giving them a platform to publish

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,799
their ideas

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,720
their experiences so we do that on the

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,440
blog and things like that

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
um and also mentioning contributors by

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,480
name at every opportunity

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,880
um my former boss her name is tricito

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
had a really lovely slide last year

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,000
and i just couldn't get it in time for

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,440
the session

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,520
but um she had the names of as many

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,760
instructors as there are in the

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,840
carpentries on one slide

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,159
you really couldn't find like you

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,480
couldn't read it wasn't legible

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,360
for the people viewing the slide but

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,400
what that did

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,600
is for an instructor i can go and find

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,240
my name and say hey

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,880
i'm there and it looks really cool um

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,480
anyway so there's better ways to do that

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,200
and we try to do that we have a

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,679
carpentries.org

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
instructors carpentries.org slash

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,080
trainers

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,919
trying different ideas for how to

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,159
recognize people better

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,679
in our community and i welcome your

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,279
ideas in chat too

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,120
what are some of the ways you can

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,120
recognize people more openly

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,679
in communities okay and then

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,240
the last thing i want to mention before

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,440
we move on to challenges which is where

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,760
i'd like to spend a bit of time

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,720
what are some other strategies to retain

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,039
community members as they grow

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,480
so retention is the ability to keep

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,200
people interested

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,039
and willing to engage and contribute to

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,600
community activities

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,679
um so that means as a community is

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,320
growing you don't want to lose out

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
on the people that were there before you

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,039
want to keep them

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,640
and also keep new newcomers interested

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,400
and working together

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,799
um so what are the some of the

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,919
strategies around that

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,600
um so

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,600
one of them is the governance structure

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,720
so i mentioned that our community

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,279
members

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,120
constitute the executive council which

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,240
makes governance decisions in the

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
carpentries

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
and every so often they will rotate in

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,279
and out of

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,760
roles um so that makes sure everyone

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,200
who is interested in leadership and in

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,760
understanding leadership

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,480
better and especially in a non-profit

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,679
setting

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,960
is able to apply and be

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,440
voted in by community members

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,640
or nominated by a former executive

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,559
council to serve

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,880
on um at a governance level

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,000
and then they work closely with other

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,039
community members

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,640
to prioritize community needs based on

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,039
the funding we've received and the

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,159
resources we have at hand

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,279
and then our community members

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,720
genuinely do all of the heavy lifting

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:22,320
so i think because they come in and and

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,760
build relationships and um really strive

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,039
to keep them going and those

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,919
relationships

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,799
develop into collaborations sometimes

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,080
they become

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,559
formal partnerships um sometimes people

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,279
say hey

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,600
it looks like you are from this domain

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,279
of expertise which i'm also from

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,279
and it looks like the carpentries

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,880
doesn't have lessons that cater to a

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,760
domain how about

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,200
we develop a lesson in python to

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,320
introduce python or

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,480
r to community members in our specific

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,080
context and that becomes a way that they

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,159
collaborate

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,520
and they continue to share and do the

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,919
really hard work

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,039
which is to talk about the difficult

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,960
issues

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,799
and to find ways to solve them together

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
and then some of the things we've had to

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,520
do is think about

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
how we communicate in an online setting

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,080
because

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,360
that's 90 or that's that that's a huge

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,399
percentage of how

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,640
you know how our community grows

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,080
and how they come together at any given

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,880
time um so

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
under the conversations repo the second

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
link

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,559
github.com convert capentries

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,360
conversations the first issue

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,960
and it's still pinned on that profile um

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,520
is

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
one around communication so time and

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,120
time again we go back to people and ask

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,320
them so this is how we've been

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,840
communicating

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,240
and these are the platforms we've

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,880
employed to make it possible to meet

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,720
and talk um which ones are great for you

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,919
and which ones aren't working

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
and why you can see the most recent work

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,240
that we did

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,720
from mid last year in that blog post

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,960
if you search both bridges balloons and

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,279
there's an elaborate blog post

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,559
about how we communicate and the work

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,159
isn't done

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,720
if we go to a new community and realize

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,039
that

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
you know some of the resources we use

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,720
are not available to people in that

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
country we need to go back to the

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,080
drawing board so to speak

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,559
and try to involve them as well

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,640
um yeah so like right now if you check

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,880
the conversations repository

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
you'll see there's a question that we

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
that i put out

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,600
just yesterday because we realized there

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,640
are tools

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,880
and platforms that have for long been

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,919
inaccessible to community members in

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
some places

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
we don't know the full extent of them so

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,399
we're asking people to tell us what

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
tools

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,240
are blocked in the country that you are

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,720
or are available

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,320
and then we hope to use that information

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
to start to think about

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,559
how else can we organize so that people

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,120
are still able to collaborate without

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,840
necessarily fragmenting the community

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,799
further

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,679
but achieving you know our mission which

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,320
is to teach

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,080
foundational computational skills and

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
data science skills to as many

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,760
researchers and librarians as we can get

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,399
to

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,640
um and then collecting ownership like i

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,360
said before everything is licensed for

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,559
free use

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,919
and reuse um so cc by applies

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,120
and that's for the lessons themselves

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,159
and all other associated resources um

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,480
guides and workflows the events that we

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
run

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,919
so we'll put out how we did this and in

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,240
a way that other people can borrow

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,159
and use resources there'll be you know

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,480
spreadsheets we used and

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
um frameworks are used for meetings and

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,440
things like that and that people

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,679
can borrow and use um and then

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,519
continuing to expand opportunities for

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,799
people to be involved

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,360
um so there's three things i want to

00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,279
mention

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,720
and this these things make me really

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,880
happy so

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,760
we realized there's lots of um

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,519
domains that we haven't gotten to yet

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,120
and that there are no lessons for us so

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,559
think about this and i'll mention

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,559
journalists because

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,080
i've been in a situation i could for

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,120
africa where

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,279
we had to impart data skills on

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,799
journalists so they could do data-driven

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,279
journalism better

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,200
um so think about a journalist who wants

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,360
to learn python or r

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
and doesn't know where to get started so

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,519
if another journalist had

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,039
um more experience they could come and

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,080
say hey

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,799
what about we develop a

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,080
lesson that's primarily for journalists

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,720
so there's a new space in the

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,960
carpentries called carpentry's incubator

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,799
which is where they can use the

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,360
carpentry's resources

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,080
um to develop the lessons and take as

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,720
much time as they need to

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,159
discuss and brainstorm and write the

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,559
material itself

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,039
and once they're ready to test it they

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,080
then send it to carpentry's labs which

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,120
then means

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,159
that it's being the lesson is now being

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,440
taught in different

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,000
workshops and feedback is being given to

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,840
improve the lesson in different ways and

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,240
at some point

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,480
it is reviewed and if it is ready then

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,519
it becomes a formal lesson of the

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,440
carpentries

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,600
which means it can be taught by any

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,440
instructor in any setting

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,840
around the world um yeah so i really i

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,600
really love that because it takes the

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,760
um the process away from our hands as

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,039
the coating so we are not a bottleneck

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,840
in the development of lessons that our

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,559
community would like to see

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,200
um yeah and then scoping the work of sub

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,519
communities committees and task forces

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,320
so that they don't feel overwhelmed

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,840
and especially weaving in start date and

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,799
end dates to their work

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,600
um and and that helps in the in the

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,600
sense that

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,519
people will often get banned out

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,000
and especially because they have day

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,480
jobs and the carpentries is

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,119
something that people plug into because

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,839
they

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,520
enjoy being in this community how do you

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,560
make sure that people still

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,520
are able to strike a balance and um

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,440
that them saying no doesn't make them

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,159
feel like they're bad people

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
um so weaving in processes making sure

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,800
that people are working

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,919
in teams um and and rather than

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,240
you know alone and constantly checking

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,800
in

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,839
and reminding people that um they are

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
supported

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,679
um and that in case they need to take

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,720
time out that's that's really

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,560
important to us um so we have courting

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,480
members serving as liaisons to

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,359
committees so that the

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,359
the issues the challenges they have are

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,320
we are privy to them and we are able to

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,760
help them

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,440
as much as possible um

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,760
right and then um i will say

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,560
that um one of the things we found

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,200
helped us

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,800
um a lot in thinking about how

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,720
um with the you know like bring together

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
community members who've been there

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,079
since 1998 for example when greg

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
kicked off soft carpentry and people who

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,440
joined say last year or this year

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
was for us to define what our values

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,359
were

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,920
and so until 2019

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,440
we hadn't articulated them it was

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,760
assumed and people had

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,240
a shared understanding of what was going

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,359
on and how people worked together

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,800
but we hadn't articulated our values yet

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,440
and so we prioritized this work and

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,400
community members all the feedback they

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,599
gave us is what helped us to define this

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,640
and now we have core values um that we

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,200
all agree on

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,680
and that we're able to share with people

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,400
um

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
you know that give a better idea of who

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
we are

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,760
beyond the code of conduct um what are

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,040
what are the things that define us what

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,880
are the things that

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,839
make us who we are how would you

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,400
describe a carpentry's community member

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,880
and these

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
nine are the ones that um community

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,880
members came up with

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,960
i feel that like that gives people a

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
better sense of belonging and

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
understanding of what this

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,240
is and how as human beings first as

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,920
human beings first they're coming

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,359
together to do good

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,920
um in a technical setting let's talk

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,359
about challenges

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,160
um so these are tasks and situations

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,119
that test the community's ability

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,720
abilities to coexist to collaborate to

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,920
develop and to thrive

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,320
i will say so what are the challenges

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,680
that

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,079
um the carpentries has fixed and there's

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,560
a lot

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,200
more than this but in the interest of

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,400
time

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,800
and because i'd also love um

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,160
to to hear from you or answer some of

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,720
the questions you have

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,079
and please feel free to use chat to

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
share your questions

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,160
you can start typing them now i will

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,400
scroll up and down when i come

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,520
when i'm ready to start answering them

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
in a bit

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,640
so some of the challenges we faced at

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,720
this the challenge of time zones because

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,960
they're truly a global community if you

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,359
remember that map from the beginning

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
we have community members from new

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,520
zealand

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,320
and australia and japan and then

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,079
cutting across countries in europe and

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,680
then we have community members in

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,560
somalia ethiopia

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,040
sudan and then south africa and then

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,079
we've run workshops in nigeria as well

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,280
and then you know the states and parts

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,000
of south america

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,440
and canada as well there was even a

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,680
workshop in

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,760
alaska at some point and so how do you

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,720
bring all those people together how do

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,040
you

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,280
make community discussions possible how

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,720
do you make a conference a community

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
conference possible

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,079
how do you make meetings with a team

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,200
that's

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,599
across time zones um possible and then

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,839
the

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,359
language barrier which sometimes has

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,599
impeded us from

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,440
getting into new countries so a lot of

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,240
the countries that were shaded

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
and grey some of them will need us to

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,000
have

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,960
lessons translated and say in chinese

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,720
first before we can start to say okay we

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
now want to run a workshop

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,000
which might then lead to the growth of a

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
local

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,320
community that will plug into the global

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,839
carpentries community

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,599
but for now we don't have we we need a

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,960
community to sort of

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,240
translate the lessons and then help us

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,359
reach more community

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
members like in china for example um and

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,680
how do you make

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,800
cross-border collaborations where um

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,920
english is not the native language um of

00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,839
different people

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,640
but you would like them to have a

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,640
setting where they can

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
um and then you have a growing community

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,079
which means that their needs are

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,839
evolving what people needed

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,320
in train uh in 1998 when greg set up

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,440
um drug and friends set up software

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
carpentry isn't

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,800
what the community needs right now and

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,920
how do we recognize these things

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,960
anyway um barriers to entry

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,200
um so how have we tried to address this

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,000
community challenges so barriers to

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,839
entry

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,960
um we what we try to do

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,320
is not assume anything we ask

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,119
questions a lot and we let the community

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,079
tell us where they're at and what their

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,720
experiences

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,079
are what their suggestions are about the

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,760
way to go forward

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,880
um so remember consensus driven

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
um that we do a lot of work in a

00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,160
consensus-driven

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,440
environment so we use our conversations

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,520
report a lot for that

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,680
and you can scroll through and see all

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,800
the types of questions we've been asking

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,920
right from you know feedback about our

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,560
communications

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,839
all the way from 2016 we used it

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,800
extensively again

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,440
last year um just yesterday the question

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,000
about

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,640
availability and access to platforms and

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,920
tools that online communities use

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,520
the question about carpentry's values um

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,359
so we try to

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,680
every time we see there's a challenge

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,520
that pops up we try and find out if

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,240
community members have experience and

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,119
suggestions for how to go about it

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,599
we use that information to inform the

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,000
work of committees that are set up

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,560
to then help us um have formal

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,760
recommendations for how to go forward as

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,880
a carpentries

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,960
do we move away from a specific platform

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,760
in favor of another one

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,560
will that be more favorable for all it

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,319
definitely

00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,440
involves um tough decisions but

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,160
consistent consensus driven

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
decision making has been a great way

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,000
that has kept

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,960
our community going um over there

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,839
over the years and then the challenge of

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,920
time zones

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,800
um so what we do we haven't figured this

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
out yet

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
but what you currently do um and you're

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,920
welcome to more ideas

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,040
um for say if you're talking about us

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,359
a given topic let's see how we use

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,119
git how we teach git and how we use

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,160
github in the carpentries

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,599
uh we will schedule several editions of

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
that same call

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
so there's one happening at a time that

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,400
makes sense for

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,400
people in europe and africa and then

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,560
there's a time that works for people

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,680
um in you know east coast and maybe west

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,280
coast u.s

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,119
and then there'd be a time that works

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,560
for people in

00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:00,640
parts of asia and then also

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,520
in australia and new zealand and

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,800
nearby regions so things like that so

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,520
setting up several

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,920
editions and where that's not possible

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,560
recording the one session that's held

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,400
so that people can revisit the video and

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,079
then having ways for people to give

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,960
feedback um asynchronously after that

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,640
and then also um so that we are not a

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,440
bottleneck as coaching

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,480
community members are empowered to lead

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,560
discussions

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,160
we find people to facilitate these

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,400
discussions

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
who are comfortable with the subject who

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
are willing to

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,520
but also who have led the work in other

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,000
spaces

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,319
remember passing on the mic rather than

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,520
taking it ourselves

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,920
and then also encouraging the people

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,079
talk to each other a lot asynchronously

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,640
um so have discussions and github

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,920
issues go into the mailing list talk to

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,880
each other you know

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,040
chat on twitter um in in in different

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,440
ways so interact

00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,800
asynchronously and um you know normalize

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,359
that so to speak

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,720
on the right i've taken a screenshot um

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:11,040
to show you an example

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,079
of how um sessions that capentrycon are

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,160
so this was the keynote by the executive

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,000
director carrie jordan

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,520
and if you see towards the bottom of the

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,599
screen there's two different

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,839
times um so one helped people like me

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,880
for whom it's almost 2 pm right now to

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,800
attend

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
but then the second session was at a

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,599
good time really early in the morning

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,920
for

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,720
um people in new zealand and later in

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,760
the evening

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,079
evening for people in the us

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,040
so you know many people were able to

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,920
come

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,000
um yeah and then also the video is

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,720
embedded for anyone who missed it

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,640
um it's on our youtube channel but also

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,160
in the sims not in our schedule

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,640
so anyone who missed it can see it um

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,800
and then another thing we've done to

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,240
address the challenge of language as a

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,599
barrier

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,319
is our community has been really great

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,960
about leading translation efforts the

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,680
most

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,160
um prominent ones right now the ones

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,280
that

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,920
have extensive work done already

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,720
are spanish translations um of our

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,640
lessons and they have a standalone

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,280
github organization so they have

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,880
different things translated

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,520
and also the lessons in japanese

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,400
have been translated by a community in

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,000
japan

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,520
and they also have a standalone

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,319
repository that's what i have

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,760
taken screenshots of and then if you

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,560
check the

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,720
um the tag the internal

00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,560
internationalization

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,520
tag i18 and for other people

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,040
who prefer to shorten it um a lot of

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
blog posts about how

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,240
translations have happened the thought

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,400
process

00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,520
and that has gone into it the sprint

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,640
work that has gone

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,079
into it over the years and is elaborated

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,040
on by our community

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,319
members so it's still not perfect

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,000
there's many more

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,680
languages to translate our lessons into

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,160
it's something that we are actively

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,880
chatting about in slack

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,319
we have our translations channel

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
dedicated to this

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,160
um there's also i think three or four

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,599
sessions at cap and chicon

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,960
that um people have set up to discuss

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,000
um how to you know improve our

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,800
translations

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200
for our community for our lessons but

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,240
also

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,119
other resources so communications our

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,160
blog posts

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,240
all the guides that we have um

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
yeah so that's something we're actively

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,400
thinking about

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,839
and welcome any ideas that you have

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,359
to help us and then the challenge of a

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,920
growing community

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,880
with evolving needs and also that these

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,720
communities

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,040
are from different contexts and so

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,319
um you know a strategy that would work

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,119
in one region

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,680
will fail and fail miserably in another

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,160
one

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,040
um so how do we try to address this

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,280
challenge

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,880
and one of the biggest ways that i can

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,599
tell you about

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,640
is the regional coordinators program and

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,160
what that is

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,599
is oh my calendar tells me it's time for

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,359
me to rest in 10 minutes that's cool

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,920
one of the biggest ways i can think

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,200
about is

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,920
the regional coordinator program so we

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,560
have

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,240
community members in different regions

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,000
who are supported by

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,000
member organizations so a member

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,760
organization will hire someone

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,119
and then tell the carpentries we would

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,839
like to give

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,200
40 percent of this person's time to

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,599
carpentry's

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,760
activities and what these people

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,520
regional coordinators will do

00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:02,160
is organize workshops in their regions

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:06,400
so for example alex alexandra and yakomo

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,200
are the regional coordinators for the uk

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,720
and now we tatara is the regional

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:16,800
coordinator for the nordics and baltics

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,280
and then there's damian from

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,319
australia there's james and john from

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,800
canada

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,800
there's megan from new zealand and

00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,920
angelique who's the regional

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,079
uh consultant for south south and africa

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,400
um so they they understand the

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,440
challenges that are in different places

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,680
and they're able to guide um you know

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,319
local community efforts and the

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,359
organizing of workshops in these places

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,160
for example when covered happened at

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,640
angelique

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,760
in south and africa they had already set

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,800
aside budget

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,599
to support the

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,520
you know um travel and accommodation of

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,040
people to come to workshops and when

00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,880
that was impossible

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,240
they rerouted those funds into buying um

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,119
bundles so um internet um for people

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,480
so that they could join the online

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,480
workshops instead

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,599
and that has been a really great example

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,160
of how to

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,880
you know work for the context that

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,720
you're in

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,559
so you can read more about them on the

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
website as well

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,839
and then we also developed a resource

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,559
called capentryconnect.org which is

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,200
meant to empower local communities to

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,800
set up

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,880
local meetings and fundraise for them

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,079
just so they have guidelines to make it

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,240
easier and so that

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,559
they don't have to wait on us the

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,839
courting to help them which sometimes

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,920
takes a long time

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,599
so they are able to go right on ahead

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,079
and they are able to

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:51,920
support so we don't hold them back

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:55,359
okay and i am done with my presentation

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,920
um so i wanted to say that

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,400
there's a lot to be done as you can see

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,800
in this regional coordinator map

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,720
um it's the same map with the workshops

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,599
um like i said before

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,680
the places shaded grey are places where

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,599
we haven't been able to get to

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,359
and as you can see there's a great need

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,119
for us to do a lot more

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,440
across um countries in africa

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,559
but i know a lot of it starts with a

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,079
conversation

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:27,119
and that's important to us too and so

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,240
um we welcome you to join our community

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,680

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,040
