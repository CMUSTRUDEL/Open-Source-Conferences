Title: Cheuk Ting Ho - Untangle Spaghetti Python Paths - How to manage your Python... || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Have you seen the Python Environment by xkcd:!
To avoid having such a spaghetti in your computer, you should create a new virtual environment when you start a new project and have a single tool to record your environment setup (e.g. which version of python, what packages to install) so it is reproducible.

It's too late!! I have already messed up :-(

Don't worry, we will help you to untangled and set it right. In this talk, we will explain how Python paths work and why there may be a problem with your set up if you have installed Python multiple times.

In the first part of the talk, we will be exploring some common problem involving python paths and where your library sit when you pip install. We will also briefly explain how the paths can be different between different operating systems and python distributions.

In the second part of the talk, we will introduce a few popular tools for managing multiple version of python environment and the common practice in managing environments. We will also talk about the advantage in doing so, especially during open-source development.

This talk is designed for beginners in Python who has not been practicing any environment control/ management, and anyone who would like to explore different ways of management their Python environments.

hello

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
uh welcome to my talk so uh this is

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
actually about how to untangle your

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
spaghetti python pops okay so uh

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,760
well like actually on tuesday there's a

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
workshop by david

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
about how to use a conduct to manage

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,520
your data science environment

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,000
and actually that's kind of be related i

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
would say

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,440
i'm just adjusting my webcam because

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,239
it's a bit weird just seeing half of my

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
face there

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,160
um so yeah so uh well first of all i'll

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,600
just have a brief introduction i'm chuck

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,760
and hello and also um i i'm involved in

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,239
a lot of open source project actually

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
um so i'm very lucky that right now i'm

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,079
working full time for terminus tv

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
you can see the very cute card there on

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
the right hand side

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,640
we are open source graph database that

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,840
could do revision control

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
basically means that you could do all

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
this good stuff with your data

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,040
okay so uh yeah so if you're interested

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,400
talk to me we are open source we open

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
source forever it will be free to

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
download and use

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
so if you have data that you want to

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
store in a graph database you can chat

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
to me um

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,360

python happened a few weeks ago

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,320
and we will have pi data global um

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,759
in november so the cfp is extended so

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
now it's still open so you can still

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,320

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
and also there will be pyjamas conf is a

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,079

please uh don't worry about paying

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,959
um okay so back to our talk so

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,640
okay all these like spaghetti python pop

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
so this is actually what i talk about

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,680
like when i talk about spaghetti

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,080
this is a comic that is in xkcd

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,840
so it's a very popular online comics

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
they have a lot of jokes about data

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
science or python or coding stuff uh if

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
you'd like you can

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
watch you know read the comics there and

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,480
this is one of the episodes

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
or actually like as some python easter

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,000
egg it's also related to skcd so

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
it's well known in the pipeline

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
community so yeah this is one of their

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
episodes of their comics so

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,360
this is basically i feel that i totally

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
agree

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
like when i was like you know using

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
python for a while

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
you'll see that oh my god like how many

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
pythons do i have in my

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
computer like it's kind of like you

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,480
install different version of python

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,840
intentionally or intentionally you don't

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
know where it got installed because

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
sometimes you know

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
something just installed for you or if

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
you follow a workshop or

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
follow a um a tutorial you just install

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
things because well i want to catch up i

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,519
want to follow and then you install

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
things

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
and you have no idea where to install

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,879
and at the end

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
things will become a mess like this like

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,920
like this spaghetti thing

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,760
and um and the the thing is like it

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,040
would actually like really trip you up

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
like later hello oh you're the moderator

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
hello joseph thank you

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,319
um yeah so yeah you you will be really

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
like struggling

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
for example i have you know i've been

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
mentoring a workshop and then someone

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
just like

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
encountered a problem that the pip and

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,120
the python is pointing to two different

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
versions

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,600
so everything that that person could

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,520
install doesn't work in the python

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
so what should i do well there's

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
actually a trick that some of you may

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
know that when you install things to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
make sure that you're using the same

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
python

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
because when you try to use python you

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,680
type python and then you type

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,960
things right so you can do type python

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
dash m pip install and then that will be

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,800
installing at the same path of the

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,199
python but still it's kind of confusing

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,720
that you know um well what if i want to

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
switch between different versions of

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
python

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,800
what should i do okay we're here to help

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
uh

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
try i'm trying to give you an idea so

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
you you won't have

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
such a problem or if you encounter such

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,919
problem in future you won't be

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,759
so scared okay so okay so first of all i

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,720
think everybody need to know

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
is to find where the python path is you

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
know where your python is installed

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
so uh yeah yeah sure i'm happy to say

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
questions thank you

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
um so yeah like where where is my python

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,199
like

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,039
okay because well we have to understand

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,320
something that you know uh when we use

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
our computer

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
so for example if i type python in my

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
command line interface

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
actually what the computer would do is

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,440
that it would um

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
there is some you know some kind of

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
notes for the computer right so it's

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,720
hidden some notes

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
from you know from you that is saying

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,759
okay if my owner or

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320
if my user say python it means that this

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
program

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
or this interpreter or like because

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,479
because python you know

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
the python that we're using actually is

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
i would guess that the chances are we're

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
using the c python interpreter

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
so it's an executable program in your

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,919
computer that actually could

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
interpret python okay so when you say

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
python so the computer would be like

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
okay so what should i do with what do

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
you mean by this python

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
and then the computer will look at the

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,160
notes and then say okay

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
so someone told me that you know when my

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
users have python

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,759
means it means this executable program

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,560
sitting here in this

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,520
folder okay so this is your python path

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,520
this is

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
when you type python what your computer

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,639
will do

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
why your computer know that you're using

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,440
python and where is your

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
python program sitting okay so

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,360
the way to find it uh if you're using

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
unix i put it there because i'm using a

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
mac so uh this is like

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,120
that's how i do like a type which python

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
that it would just uh tell me uh but i

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
guess a lot of you are using windows so

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,639
what you can do is that you can check

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
actually if you don't want to use

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
command lines well i'm scared of command

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,599
line i don't want to use it you can

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,919
actually go to

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,919
open your folders and find whether you

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,880
have a python 360 or

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,360
a free h if you're using python 3.h in

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
your c

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,080
drive or it could be sitting under your

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,520
user folder so you have to go to user

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,039
and then find your name and then app

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
data and then local just follow that

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,880
path and then find it

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,720
so uh double click the screen twice

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,599
uh did it look no yeah i don't know

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,599
whether it's like

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
it's only applied for me or something so

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,960
uh yeah

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,919
so let me know if i can do anything to

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,919
help you to read

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,280
uh but yeah you know uh you can follow

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,400
that path and to

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,360
um to find your python program there but

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
in the command line is more

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
straightforward if you're using windows

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,280
you can just type

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,039
where python okay or if where python

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
doesn't work for some reason you can

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,800
uh follow the right hand side there type

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,639
you know

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
type all those things i actually i i

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
don't like i know that's changing

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,479
directory and then like show me

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
find find me something with kev spell

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,520
similar to python

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
but i don't exactly know like the thing

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,560
because that's windows i'm using mac

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,960
um so also uh

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,400
sign up for this uh slice how to use it

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
is that anything start with a dollar

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
sign means that you type it in your

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,240
command line

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
anything that doesn't start with a

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
dollar sign is mean that maybe it's

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
output

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,879
from your command line okay so

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,039
uh so far so good i hope and

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
um yeah so so yeah that's why i

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,039
recommend you to download slice

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
uh i don't know what i could uh yeah but

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,440
i would go back

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,879
you know uh to the to the top when i

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,759
finished my talk so you can download the

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,599
slides afterwards

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
then you have all these stuff uh

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
yourself okay don't worry too much about

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
it right now

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,519
um so yeah uh well that's two other ways

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,039
to find like

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,080
where your packages are sitting so um

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,800
yeah so i when you actually pick install

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,279
something

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
um so where does where does still things

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
sitting so that's also another thing

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
that we

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,920
we want to care about because not just

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
where my python is sitting it's like

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,240
where

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
the other other things that i pick these

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
doors are sitting because

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
if python can't find those things then

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
you can't

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
use them or you can't import them right

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
so i don't need to know where

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
all the things that you put install are

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,440
sitting so one thing to do it

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
is to well you can see this is the

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
things you can type in the command line

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,279
like i said you have the dollar sign in

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
the beginning you can type that in the

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
command line

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
but what this is doing basically it's

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
just the thing in the green there

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
actually our python code so we are

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
running this python code to get

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
the information about a particular

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,959
library for this case it's

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,519
the example is set up tools so it's

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,880
finding where this setup tool is sitting

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,959
okay so um so the

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,800
so you can actually like just just run

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,920
those python code in python to find

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,320
out for example pandas or final requests

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,160
where are those like sitting or you can

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
just like type that in the command line

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
because it's calling python please run

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
this python code

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
um so that's finding a path of your

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
package

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
okay so that's something that you pip in

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,640
store so sometimes uh you know you don't

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
pick my store stuff because maybe your

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,399
colleague or your friend uh write a

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
piece of python

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
program it's not uploaded to pipi so you

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
didn't

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
restore it but it's a piece of you know

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,040
different

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,440
code that you could actually import in

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,200
just in your own python script okay

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
so that would be a module that would be

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,240
a module that maybe you have

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,800
um you have you have to import

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,720
and then like okay so where is this uh

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
module is importing from you can also

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
run this python code to find out

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
uh yeah there's a difference between

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,839
package and model like i said you know

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
package usually the one that you

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
pip install from the pipe i you know

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
because it's running the wheel running

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
the

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
binary but module would be the one that

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,440
is you know a python script that you

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,680
import so

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
i did just slightly different but it's

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,640
not that that important

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
but if you're interested you can go to

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,920
the link in my slides and look at

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,760
the article talking about the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
differences so yeah

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
again the slides are useful i will show

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,640
you the link at the very beginning uh

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,160
very end of the talk okay hey hi

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,920
jorgen hey hi yeah so

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,720
um okay so uh well another way to find

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,560
out where your

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,519
the thing that you could install at 16

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
is to just type pip show

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,880
okay so this is showing actually where

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,720
the pi test is installed so it's just

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
type pip show pi test

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,279
you'll see a lot of information uh that

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,360
is actually uh to come with this package

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,440
uh you know because usually those are

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
the the information about the package

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
published by the author of the package

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
so you see the versions you know the

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
name and

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
what is this for you know who is the

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
author

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,600
things like that i think also the

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,839
license so but the the most interesting

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
thing now here is the location so it's

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,120
showing you that

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,120
where this package is installed so

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
yes uh slice where we share don't worry

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,399
too much i would give you the link at

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,160
the end of the

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,200
this tutorial or i can just or maybe i

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
can just give you the link in the chat

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,279
right now

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,519
so that's okay i can quickly do that so

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,440
yeah that's more convenient i think yeah

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
for people who want to follow

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
if the words are too small because i

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,120
know it's a little bit too small

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,639
so um yeah so like

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
okay of course like some of you are

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,160
using anaconda so like i said um

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,639
on on tuesday um you know uh

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
david give a tutorial to how to use

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,440
conda uh but

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,279
if you miss that don't worry i just

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
gotta briefly talk about that now so you

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,959
have an idea

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,480
so first of all anaconda if you haven't

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
heard about it it's actually a free and

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
open source distribution of python

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,680
an hour so i always think about this is

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,399
like a gift box with a lot of different

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
things in it

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,440
and it's like a gift box to you so

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,600
that's anaconda

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,360
so it increased python and all other

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,360
things that's useful in data science or

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
scientific computing okay

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
uh so it's very convenient that's why

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
people love it because

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
installing one thing you're installing a

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
million other things

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
but some people would oh no i want to

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,200
customize i only want to download the

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,279
things that i used and you could

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
you know download your own python use

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,480
things the other way but

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
i'm talking about anaconda here because

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,920
it's popular

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,079
and it's free so um yeah and uh

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,079
what comes with anaconda what is in this

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
electronic gift box is that it

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
has something called conda which is the

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
package manager

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
so a package manager actually pip is

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,880
also a package manager

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
it's kind of managed well your package

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,519
like

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
where like you can run a command install

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
things it will keep track of what you

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
have installed what version you have

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
installed so

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
that's why it's called package manager

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,440
and um

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
so yeah you can manage your python

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
environment

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,880
using conda so uh well the example here

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,320
is that you can use conda create to

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
create a new environment so you can

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
replace my amp

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,279
there with whatever name you want you

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,639
can and then you can activate it

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,199
and then after you're done you can

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,600
deactivate it uh conda has actually a

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
base

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,040
which is a default environment there if

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
once you have installed

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,880
it and so it's just like switching

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,000
between the base and whatever that you

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,279
have created so you can

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,399
activate and deactivate um

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,399
so uh what the

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
what if like i said what if i don't want

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,760
to use anaconda or conda i want to use

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
other things well there are other things

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,399
available

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,839
uh i'm using pi m virtual m so pi f is a

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
tool that lets you switch between

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
different versions of python

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,279
virtual envy working with pyen that you

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
could

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
actually create different virtual

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
environment with different versions of

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
python okay

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,839
so i'm using that i'm familiar with that

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
it's not the best but i'm just used to

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
it

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,880
vm is the package manager that comes

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,600
with python so it's the battery included

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
version of

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,160
the package manager so um so

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
actually everybody who use python

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,920
actually

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
could yes should have a vn i think it

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,839
come

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,279
after python 2.5 or something like that

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,800
is already included so

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
if you have used python 3 then you

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,240
definitely have it uh if you're using

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
python 2 why are you still using python

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
2 okay

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,120
um so um also the there are other tools

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,120
there are pip

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
and and portrait those are the popular

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,639
ones um the advantage of those

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,480
is actually this uh when you use it uh

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,839
well you it would just it will also

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
check whether you have

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,959
compatibility issues um bill

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,560
oh i've never thought about i've never

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,880
heard about that so uh maybe

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,680
in in chat you can tell us more about it

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
later

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,480
um so yeah those those two

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
actually it would check whether for

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
example if i have

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
you know two libraries library a and

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
library b

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,639
and library a requires a

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,600
a library c that needs to be greater

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,399
than or equals to 1.2

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
and library b requires uh library c to

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,720
be

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,759
for every reason less than 1.4

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,480
well then then you know poetry or

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,279
pi pip bamboo know that okay only

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
library c

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,360
1.3 is valid so uh yeah i'll install

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,560
that for you

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,959
so uh so yeah so that's um

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
yeah well before pip oh wow okay that's

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,279
very very old

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,199
yeah so um yeah so uh

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,120
those are those are the environments uh

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,880
you know manager that you could use

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,800
um for this talk i think i won't

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,079
go too much about the other i will focus

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,199
on conda and

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,000
vn hi marlene hi

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
oh hi my way hey i have friends coming

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,320
in great

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,600
yeah i love it and um so yeah why are we

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,079
using those things like

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
why do we have to install extra things

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
on

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,759
our python i'm just using python why am

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,480
i doing extra stuff to do this

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,680
well that's really really good reason uh

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
because

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
i can tell you about my own experience

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
like well you have a piece of code at

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,160
work

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
like i i remember when i was working as

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
a data scientist

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,880
i would write a piece of code right like

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,399
okay do this clean the data and then run

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,199
some machine learning things okay it

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,040
works

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
put it aside for a few months and then

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
come back in as like

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,639
okay i want to use this code again it

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,959
doesn't work what happened

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
well i've got some like kind of error

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,880
like message from

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
pandas because well basically what i you

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
know what i'm

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
when i write the code before i was using

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
a

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,280
version of pandas that's old and uh

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,880
well it works but uh when i you know

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
pick it up after a few months or the

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
next year

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,319
then uh the version of pandas i'm using

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
does not support that anymore because

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,600
i've updated it

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,679
and oops you know um yeah or

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
if you copy some code online and you

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
know or your colleague gave you some

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
code

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,520
then well it does not work it's the same

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,880
reason that's you know the version that

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,559
you're using are not the same

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,640
so um yeah so usually the habit is that

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
we would create a

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,039
requirements.txt to kind of pinpoint you

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
know pip

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,280
we do a pip freeze if you didn't know so

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,559
if you type quick freeze and then

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
it will just show everything that you

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,080
have with the version and then you can

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
pipe it into a text file

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,679
called requirements.txt and then you can

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,440
also put give that to

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
whoever you're giving your code with say

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,520
like hey my good word

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,799
my code work in this environment but

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,480
then you have a question if you don't

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,600
have an environment manager okay i'll

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,559
install those

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,559
but then maybe there's incompet income

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,880
compatibility that you know you update

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
it

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,000
it works with this piece of code that

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,440
you get but

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
it doesn't work with the other code that

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,760
you have written so

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
no it's a big note okay um so that's not

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,240
good we don't want that

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,600
and um yeah again like it works on my

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
computer well because people are using

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,160
different versions so um

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,200
nope and uh well yeah that's the crazy

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,679
thing that you know

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,280
um you know i think there are some type

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
of there but i will just explain

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,480
so what happened is like you know uh

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
like i said you know

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,160
for this project i need the version you

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,520
know the older version of pandas for

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,080
this new project i need

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,000
new version of pandas how can i go to

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,919
switch like do i have to install and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,039
install my pandas every time if i switch

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,919
between those two

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,440
scripts or two projects that's that's

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,640
that's crazy i don't want to do that

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,039
that's making me very very mad um

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,280
so what we can do is that we could use

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,440
the environment manager to help us

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,200
so like i said i will focus on like

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
honda because alacante is popular and

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,559
people

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
may have it you know so if you're using

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,919
a content you will have it

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,919
and yeah

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,160
yeah conda got its own uh own drawback

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
as

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,640
well yeah system python

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,200
yeah uh well i think yeah because well

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
there's some love and hate with condos

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
because

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,320
well con is easy for people who just you

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,960
know want to do things quickly like they

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
do

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,480
like if alaconda's providing everything

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,919
that they need they will happily use

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,919
condo or like you know

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,200
because they don't have to mess with two

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,120
customized things

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
but if you want to customize your python

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
build of your python environment build

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,520
then you

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
better use something else and i'm also

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,799
giving you like on so on the left hand

00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
side is conda on the right hand side is

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,159
actually

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,520
vn so vm again everybody should have it

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,480
if you have python you should have it

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,720
and then you could basically just use bn

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,840
so i won't go into detail here about

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
like all these code

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,600
uh because well i just want you to try

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
so the first two boxes

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
actually is like how to create an

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,039
environment so you can try those so

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
all of them i forgot to put the dollar

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,200
sign for all of them like you could do

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
it in your

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,320
command line interface um

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,600
so the second two boxes will be how to

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,280
activate environment

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,120
and then you would go to your python

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,159
terminal and to see if you can import

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,799
pandas

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
so i just assuming that biggest panda is

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,159
so popular that everybody would already

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,679
have panda so now you create a new

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,880
environment and then now you should

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,120
actually see that

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
you can't import pandas anymore because

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
you create a new environment that is

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,760
brand new you don't have anything

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,080
you don't have the things that you used

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,799
to have or you can import something that

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,960
you

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,240
you have in your other environment it

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
doesn't need to be pandas

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
but you can see that actually you don't

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,400
have anything now because you just

00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,440
create a new environment and you're

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,600
activating it

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
so you're in that environment right now

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
so what you can do

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,320
is that was after you have tested you

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
exit

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,559
the pen the python and then now you

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,480
install whatever you need

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,880
then then now then you would be able to

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,080
pre-install it again now you be able to

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
import it again

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,919
because now you're installing this for

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,960
example pandas

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,840
in your new environment and now you can

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,280
import it again so yeah there's another

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,960
example there that is like

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,799
try to install um german sdb clients

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,200
which is my library that's why i

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
was like i'm just betting that none of

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,679
you will have it so you can just test it

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,679
out

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
in storage and then now you can import

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,799
it in your environment

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
but um but when you deactivate your

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,760
environment

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,679
you won't be able to import it anymore

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,559
because uh because

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,120
you know it's only in the environment so

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,520
that's

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,120
why it's powerful that you have

00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
different environments that basically

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,240
you can

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,000
customize each one of them so it's like

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
you know um you have different

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,080
cars you customize them you know i i

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,320
like games so if maybe like you're in

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
the racing games over each round when

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
you play the game

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,640
customize your call before you race so

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
it's kind of like that you know you can

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,280
have different environment and customize

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,039
the build

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
before you start working on your project

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,159
and when you're done you can just like

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,600
save and quit you know just deactivate

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,280
and the next time you want to use that

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,720
environment again you can activate it

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,919
again so that's really cool that's

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
really good

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,039
it's very often like i'm not an

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
organized person but i still love it

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,400
it's more organized

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,720
it would be like less prone to problems

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,360
that i told you before

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
um so yeah so far do you have any

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
questions

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,200
and uh because i still have like two

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
more slides just

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,960
for like advertisements for my future

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
events and

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640
um and what's going on that you could

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,200
join but

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,679
yeah yeah someone loved condor yeah

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,159
david yes i know you have the workshop

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,120
on tuesday and yeah that's really good

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,679
yes

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,960
um yeah so

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,520
uh conda live vm so

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,679
functionally they're all they're both uh

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,840
environment managers that you could

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
activate them uh you know you could

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
create a new environment

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
you can activate it it will be isolated

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,360
and you can

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
install stuff and after that you can um

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,120
you can deactivate it

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,559
of course under the hood is different

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,480
because well there are two

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
different tools that they may be there

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,240
using different methods

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,360
internally to to achieve these

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
operations

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,640
but as a user basically they feel very

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
similar

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
which people may prefer one over the

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
other for example my experience is that

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,679
i'm using because i'm using a

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,360
pi n virtual m and then you know for one

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
contribution that i installed honda

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,880
because it was recommended

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,559
and then the con that doesn't like vm

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,760
virtual and they kind of fight with each

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,679
other and it's like

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,279
i want to manage you it's like no no i

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
want to manage yourself oh my god like

00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,679
and it really messes thing up so i have

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,880
to

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,400
uninstall conda because of that because

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
it's like you know you already have a

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
dog and then you kind of adopt another

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,000
dog but they don't like each other's oh

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
sorry i have to find a new home for my

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,559
new dog um

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,320
so yeah uh so kind of like that so um

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,240
yeah sometimes you have to pick yeah

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
which one you want to use and

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,480
use in most cases you don't need more

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,360
than one so

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
yeah if there isn't any questions i

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
would just give

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
some shameless advertisement at the end

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,919
so first of all

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
uh we have our data washer with pycon

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,320
africa this sunday so

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,520
um yeah so it's it's a full day workshop

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
so that's why we ask

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,760
an organizer whether we can uh have it

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,799
on sunday then you know people can

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,880
enjoy all the goodness of pagan africa

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,640
and then they can still you know attend

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,520
a workshop if they want to

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,880
um so yeah it's actually like the sign

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,559
up is already done

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
we already you know get all the

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,240
applications and all the applications

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,279
are already confirmed

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,279
but we may have more in the future um so

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
if you really want to know about whether

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,640
we will be running another workshop

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,240
uh or whether we'll be recruiting

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,559
mentors again you can

humbledata.org um yeah

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
and oops another shameless advertisement

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080

sometimes we touch on some not so

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,880
beginners topic but the idea is that

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,279
this for people who

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,000

you know we explore different topics in

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,240

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
go back to the first slide so you'll

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,520
