Description: 
	Have you seen the Python Environment by xkcd:!
To avoid having such a spaghetti in your computer, you should create a new virtual environment when you start a new project and have a single tool to record your environment setup (e.g. which version of python, what packages to install) so it is reproducible.

It's too late!! I have already messed up :-(

Don't worry, we will help you to untangled and set it right. In this talk, we will explain how Python paths work and why there may be a problem with your set up if you have installed Python multiple times.

In the first part of the talk, we will be exploring some common problem involving python paths and where your library sit when you pip install. We will also briefly explain how the paths can be different between different operating systems and python distributions.

In the second part of the talk, we will introduce a few popular tools for managing multiple version of python environment and the common practice in managing environments. We will also talk about the advantage in doing so, especially during open-source development.

This talk is designed for beginners in Python who has not been practicing any environment control/ management, and anyone who would like to explore different ways of management their Python environments.
